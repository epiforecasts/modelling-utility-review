   abstract = {This paper presents a SEIAR-type model considering quarantined individuals (Q), called SQEIAR model. The dynamic of SQEIAR model is defined by six ordinary differential equations that describe the numbers of Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered individuals. The goal of this paper is to reduce the size of susceptible, infected, exposed and asymptomatic groups to consequently eradicate the infection by using two actions: the quarantine and the treatment of infected people. To reach this purpose, optimal control theory is presented to control the epidemic model over free terminal optimal time control with an optimal cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimal final time. Also, an impulsive epidemic model of SQEIAR is considered to deal with the potential suddenly increased in population caused by immigration or travel. Since this model is suitable to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, especial attention is devoted to this case. Thus, numerical simulations are given to prove the accuracy of the theoretical claims and applied to the particular data of this infection. Moreover, numerical computations of the COVID-19 are compared with diseases like Ebola and Influenza. In addition, the controller is evaluated with system parameters identified by using actual data of China. Finally, the controller tuned with the estimated parameters of the Chinese data is applied to the actual data of Spain to compare the quarantine and treatment policies in both countries.

   journal = {Social Science and Medicine},
   volume = {337},
   pages = {116298},
   abstract = {Objective: This study examined several factors affecting the perception of Canadian parents about their children's mental health during COVID-19. The contribution of this research included fresh evidence from examining the demographic and sociological factors influencing children's well-being during COVID-19 using the Canadian context. Method(s): We used a cross-sectional dataset from Statistics Canada titled Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians - Parenting during the Pandemic (2020). We relied on an ordered logit model and computed the respective odds ratios. Result(s): Our results showed that parents with a university degree and those working from home are less concerned about their children's mental health. Nonetheless, having a disabled child, belonging to a minority, having children aged six-to fourteen-years old, and having lost a job or experienced a drop in working hours increased parents' worry. Additionally, having worries about being connected with family and friends, being concerned about work-life balance, feeling lonely at home, and waiting for the reopening of childcare services all increased the likelihood of parents' anxiety about their child's mental health. When running the analysis by province, we saw that being an immigrant and belonging to a minority increased parents' worry only in Ontario and British Columbia. Conclusion(s): Policymakers are encouraged to foster working-from-home practices as working from home has been linked to less worry about child mental health, mainly among mothers, as indicated in our gender heterogeneity analysis. In addition, it is advised that families with a disabled child, and families belonging to a minority received additional support. Lastly, policymakers are advised to consider the social cost of preventive measures and incorporate this into any future preventative policymaking as the social impact variables were robust across all models.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Introduction: The impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the effect of preventive health strategies on acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are largely unknown. The public health model imposed during the pandemic and the lessons learnt have implications on recommending future preventive strategies for COPD care in general and exacerbations in particular. Aim(s): This study endeavors to assess the role of preventive strategies of COVID-19 on exacerbation rates of COPD during the lockdown period compared to similar periods the previous year and assess the compliance to preventive strategies for COVID-19 among COPD patients. Method(s): This is a hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study at a tertiary care center. AECOPD in patients during a period spanning five months in the pre-lockdown days was compared with exacerbation rates for a similar period during the national lockdown. Result(s): Sixty-eight patients were recruited (mean age: 67.38) among whom 47 were males and 21 were females. There were only 7 (10.3%) reported admissions during the lockdown period of 5 months compared to 50 (73.5%) during the corresponding period pre-lockdown. Mild exacerbations reported during the lockdown period were also significantly less with only 17 (25%) against 58 (85.3%) during the pre-lockdown period. Adherence to measures such as donning of masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing was observed among COPD patients with good compliance to the health practices promulgated in the pandemic. Discussion(s): A significant reduction in exacerbation rates among AECOPD patients during the period of lockdown was observed compared to a similar period the year prior. Noticeable were the findings that both community-based milder exacerbations and severe exacerbations necessitating hospitalizations showed a reduction during the period of lockdown. Adaptability, compliance and acceptance to usage of masks, hand hygiene measures, and norms such as physical distancing were observed in the majority of COPD patients.Copyright © 2023 Acharya et al.},

   title = {Pathological buying on the rise? Compensative and compulsive buying in Poland in the pre- and (Post-)pandemic times},
   journal = {PLoS ONE},
   volume = {19},
   number = {3 March},
   pages = {e0298856},
   abstract = {The study concerns the development of compensative and compulsive buying in Poland comparing the results of three waves of a cross-sectional study conducted before and at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Six predictors of susceptibility to compensative and compulsive buying are in focus: materialism, self-esteem, gender, age, frequency of online shopping, and experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the importance of the first four predictors in explaining compensative and compulsive buying is already very well described in the literature, while the novelty consists in the predictive model including the variables that describe frequency of online shopping and negative experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as coronavirus infection, hospitalization or death of a loved one. On the one hand, a stronger susceptibility to compensative and compulsive buying could be a reaction to these negative experiences of the pandemic; on the other hand, the increased frequency of online shopping as a result of the pandemic may be an important factor in the development of compensative and compulsive buying due to the easy implementation of purchase acts and weaker social control. To achieve the above research objectives, the German Compulsive Buying Indicator (GCBI) was used to measure susceptibility to compensative and compulsive buying. The data were obtained within three waves of the study (2010, 2019, 2022) based on a random sample of about 1,000 respondents representing statistically the general adult population. Drawing on this study, the prevalence of compensative and compulsive buying is observed at 12-19% and 2-4%. The predictors of GCBI are materialism, self-esteem, gender in all examined models and additionally age, frequency of online shopping, and experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in selected models. Although the findings related to the role of materialism, self-esteem, and gender in the prediction of GCBI reflect the results reported in the literature, the analogous conclusions about age, online shopping, and experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic are different from the established opinions. The commonly reported effect of age becomes statistically significant when the examined population is limited to Gens Y and Z. Although extensive online shopping co-exists with compensative and compulsive buying in the total population, the obtained data lead to reverse conclusions in the case of women's subpopulation representing Gens Y and Z. The negative experience with the COVID-19 pandemic operationalised as hospitalization of a close friend predicts GCBI, but again only in the case of representatives of Gens Y and Z, especially among women. The findings show how important the creation of appropriate intervention strategies is within the consumer policy directed to representatives of the younger generations who may develop pathological buying as a response to negative experiences such as COVID-19 pandemic. The findings can inform of the goals behind therapeutic support for compulsive buyers, and implications for social work. People affected by excessive compensative or compulsive buying need to be given opportunities to build up their strengths and growth of their psychological resources towards healthy self-esteem, which seems to be the best protection against excessive compensative and compulsive buying.Copyright © 2024 Grzegorz Adamczyk.},

   abstract = {Background The WHO announced the epidemic of SARS-CoV2 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020. To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic. For appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. Methodology This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 187 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), and random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. For these forecasts, we evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. Findings The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generate heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in the cases in the coming 4 weeks of February 2021. Conclusion Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry short-term forecasting models, like ARIMA and ETS, can help in anticipating the future outbreaks of SARS-CoV2.Copyright © 2021 Ahmad et al.},

   pages = {98},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smokers are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Lockdown was a chosen strategy to deal with the spread of infectious diseases; nonetheless, it influenced people's eating and smoking behaviors. The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on smoking (waterpipe and cigarette) behavior and its associations with sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index. METHOD(S): The data were derived from a large-scale retrospective cross-sectional study using a validated online international survey from 38 countries (n=37207) conducted between 17 April and 25 June 2020. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMR countries) data related to 10 Arabic countries that participated in this survey have been selected for analysis in this study. A total of 12433 participants were included in the analysis of this study, reporting their smoking behavior and their BMI before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between smoking practices and the participant's country of origin, sociodemographic characteristics, and BMI (kg/m2). RESULT(S): Overall, the prevalence rate of smoking decreased significantly during the lockdown from 29.8% to 23.5% (p<0.05). The percentage of females who smoke was higher than males among the studied population. The highest smoking prevalence was found in Lebanon (33.2%), and the lowest was in Oman (7.9%). In Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, the data showed a significant difference in the education level of smokers before and during the lockdown (p<0.05). Smokers in Lebanon had lower education levels than those in other countries, where the majority of smokers had a Bachelor's degree. The findings show that the BMI rates in Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, and Saudi Arabia significantly increased during the lockdown (p<0.05). The highest percentages of obesity among smokers before the lockdown were in Oman (33.3%), followed by Bahrain (28.4%) and Qatar (26.4%), whereas, during the lockdown, the percentage of obese smokers was highest in Bahrain (32.1%) followed by Qatar (31.3%) and Oman (25%). According to the logistic regression model, the odds ratio of smoking increased during the pandemic, whereas the odds ratio of TV watching decreased. This finding was statistically significant by age, gender, education level, country of residence, and work status. CONCLUSION(S): Although the overall rates of smoking among the studied countries decreased during the lockdown period, we cannot attribute this change in smoking behavior to the lockdown. Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with changes in daily tobacco consumption. Public health authorities should promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles to reduce the long-term negative effects of the lockdown.Copyright © 2022 Al Sabbah H. et al.},

   abstract = {On February 1, 2020, China announced a novel coronavirus CoVID-19 outbreak to the public. CoVID-19 was classified as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the disease was discovered and concentrated in Hubei Province, China, it was exported to all of the other Chinese provinces and spread globally. As of this writing, all plans have failed to contain the novel coronavirus disease, and it has continued to spread to the rest of the world. This study aimed to explore and interpret the effect of environmental and metrological variables on the spread of coronavirus disease in 30 provinces in China, as well as to investigate the impact of new China regulations and plans to mitigate further spread of infections. This article forecasts the size of the disease spreading based on time series forecasting. The growing size of CoVID-19 in China for the next 210 days is estimated by predicting the expected confirmed and recovered cases. The results revealed that weather conditions largely influence the spread of coronavirus in most of the Chinese provinces. This study has determined that increasing temperature and short-wave radiation would positively increase the number of confirmed cases, mortality rate, and recovered cases. The findings of this study agree with the results of our previous study.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Circulation},
   volume = {148},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted routine clinical care in 2020. We aimed to assess recovery from COVID-19's impacts on health care utilization, affordability, and cardiovascular risk factor screening in 2021, both overall and by race and ethnicity. Method(s): We used 2019 and 2021 National Health Interview Survey data-a nationally-representative, cross-sectional household interview survey of US adults (>18 years old). Outcomes included measures of health care access, affordability, and cardiovascular risk factor screening. Logistic regression models compared outcomes in 2021 (second year of pandemic) to 2019 (pre-pandemic baseline), adjusting for age and sex. An interaction term for race/ethnicity and year assessed for differential change across racial/ethnic groups. Result(s): The weighted population size was 250.9 and 253.1 million adults in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, wellness visits significantly decreased for all racial/ethnic groups compared with 2019, a decline most pronounced for Asian adults. Medical financial concerns decreased for White, Black, and Hispanic adults. Blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screening significantly decreased for all groups in 2021 vs. 2019, with the largest declines among Asian adults (see Table 1 and Figure 1 for all results). Conclusion(s): In this national study of US adults, there were significantly fewer wellness visits and lower rates of cardiovascular risk factor screening in 2021 compared to prepandemic levels, overall and across all racial and ethnic groups. These results suggest that policy efforts are needed to improve access and cardiovascular screening as the US emerges from the pandemic.},

   abstract = {Aim/Introduction: To present a method to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in highrisk individuals undergoing PET/CT using frequency of CT findings. Material(s) and Method(s): 562 consecutive patients underwent PET/CT scanning with different radiotracers in the period between the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Switzerland and 14.04.2020. All patients were asymptomatic for respiratory infection at the time of scanning and were at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognisant of recent reports showing the high sensitivity of CT for SARSCoV-2 (98%) [1], including in asymptomatic patients [2] when compared to conventional laboratory testing [3], we observed the frequency of incidental, SARS-CoV-2 related changes in PET/CT [4]. No SARS-CoV-2 related CT findings were observed, enabling an estimate of the prevalence in the asymptomatic population using the binomial proportion confidence interval (Wilson's test). Result(s): N=562 negative tests yields a point prevalence of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population as 0.325% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0-0.65). By comparison, at the time of analysis the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) reported 25826 laboratory confirmed cases (population prevalence 0.3%, 92.7% agreement). These results find broad agreement with estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other similar populations for the limited number of peerreviewed population prevalence studies published [5]. Conclusion(s): The frequency and number of CT findings in asymptomatic patients undergoing PET/CT scanning can be used to estimate the incidence for SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic population who may otherwise not present for conventional testing. Hitherto, few prevalence studies in asymptomatic populations have been conducted as a result of limited testing capacity during the pandemic. The derived model has good agreement with other empirical parameters.},

   abstract = {Background and Aim: There have been limited capacity-building activities on One Health in the Philippines. To contribute to capacity development in One Health, the authors conducted the first short course on One Health in the country for health, allied health, and collaborating professionals. This study aimed to review the preparation and implementation of the One Health course and describe the challenges and opportunities of conducting the course during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): The course curriculum was developed by a multidisciplinary group of experts. The objectives for the course were as follows: (1) Describe the concept, scope, and applications of One Health; (2) identify social and economic factors influencing food security and safety, control of zoonoses, and combating antimicrobial resistance; and (3) describe the challenges and opportunities in applying the One Health approach to achieve better public health outcomes. Recruitment of participants was based on predetermined criteria. The 3-day course was conducted online through Zoom. Pre and post-tests as well as the evaluation of the course were administered through Google forms. Result(s): The 3-day online course was attended by 136 participants from 15 of the 17 administrative regions of the country. A multidisciplinary group of experts delivered a total of 11 lectures divided into the following sessions: (1) Fundamentals of One Health; (2) Interrelatedness of Human, Animal, and Environmental Health; and (3) Applications of One Health. Conclusion(s): As the first One Health course in the Philippines, this 3-day course demonstrated the feasibility of conducting capacity-building on One Health for a multidisciplinary group of participants during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. It may serve as a model for similar and more in-depth courses on One Health for specific groups in the future and has set the stage for intersectoral communication and education, providing an avenue for collaboration for professionals in various disciplines, and facilitating the expansion of One Health network in the Philippines.Copyright © Ampo, et al.

   abstract = {Introduction: Since its emergence, COVID 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, turned out to be a health threat throughout the world. The degree of risk for the health-care workers who are dealing with the COVID-19 patients is uncertain. Questionnaire-based prospective cross-sectional study was done to assess the extent to which the Indian obstetrics and gynecology practice has been affected by the pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): From August to October 2020, 309 obstetricians (OBs) and gynecologists took part in the survey via Google forms. Impact on the present working scenario during the pandemic compared to the Pre-COVID era was evaluated. The categorical variables got illustrated through frequency (%). The association among the variables Chi-square test was utilized. Statistical significance was contemplated by the P < 0.05. Graphs were prepared using Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel 365. Result(s): There was drastic fall in parameters of obstetric practice. Over half of the OBs witnessed fall in outpatients over 90%. Significant association seen reduction in earnings with the sector, type of set-up, and duration of practice (P < 0.001) was found. Apprehension among the study group was present still majority 54.8% said that they were working voluntarily in this time of national crisis. Conclusion(s): This research indicates that the pandemic has entailed practice of obstetrics and gynecology in India. However, the smooth functioning was maintained due to the high degree of knowledge and preparedness among the doctors and the well-laid guidelines by the authorities.Copyright © 2021 Acta Medica International Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

   journal = {JMIR formative research},
   volume = {6},
   number = {11},
   pages = {e35730},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth conversations about effective behavior change models for increasing prevention behavior, ranging from wearing masks in public to physical distancing. Among the considered behavior change techniques is the use of fear appeals, through which a negative possible outcome is emphasized to invoke fear, which in turn may promote prevention behaviors to counter the likelihood of the negative outcome. Although fear is hypothesized as health promoting in some theories of health behavior, little research has rigorously assessed the relationship., OBJECTIVE: In our exploratory analyses, we aim to examine the association, including directionality of the association between fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 prevention behaviors across 2 time points during the early COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of US women., METHODS: The COPE study, a web-based survey of US women's COVID-19 experiences, was deployed in May-June 2020 (time 1) with follow-up in December 2020-January 2021 (time 2; n=200). Demographic characteristics as well as fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 prevention behaviors (eg, staying home except for essential activities, physical distancing in public, and masking in public) were measured. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were used to characterize COVID-19 prevention behaviors and fear of COVID-19 among participants. Cross-lagged panel analysis, a type of structural equation modeling that assesses directionality of temporal associations, was used to understand relationships, if any, between variables of interest., RESULTS: We found cross-sectional associations between fear of COVID-19 and staying home and physical distancing, as well as temporal associations between fear at time 1 and time 2 and prevention behaviors at time 1 and time 2. However, results of the cross-lagged panel analysis indicated no cross-lagged temporal relationships between fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 prevention behaviors 6 months apart., CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 did not appear to predict COVID-19 prevention behaviors 6 months after initial measurements among the sample of women recruited for our study. Future research should rigorously test these associations longitudinally, and alternative methods of public health prevention promotion should be considered.

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {940021},
   abstract = {Background: The healthcare financial system faced a significant disturbance of the budget balance after the outbreak of the pandemic, amid government measures to combat the disease. These measures have led to shifts in funding weights within the income and expenditure budget structure, with a focus on prevention and treatment of patients infected with SARS-COV 2. The purpose of this research is to analyse the financial balance of the healthcare system and the related modelling to support decision-makers in adopting and implementing appropriate financing measures for the pandemic. Method(s): The working hypotheses of this study were tested using an econometric linear regression model based on the financing budgetary function, which matches funding to the specific need for each expenditure heading. SPSS 25 statistical software was used to define the model and to test the homogeneity of the data and their statistical relevance to the phenomenon under analysis. Result(s): The proposed model showed that there is a significant correlation of the dependent variable, Dynamics of budget revenues in the healthcare sector (TIM), with the regressors. We believe that a problem-solving rebalancing of allocations could help to eliminate the synergy in health. This redistribution should take into account the impact that economic and budgetary factors have on healthcare factors and vice versa, so that at some point after successive adjustments the minimum distance between forecast and realisation or between need and financing of need can be reached. The used data were analysed dynamically to assess changes in trend as absolute data do not allow the construction of an overall picture. Relative data captures changes in financing from year to year and can be linked to events such as pandemics, financial crises or inflation. Conclusion(s): In relation to the objectives of the research, it emerges that, under the impact of pandemic stress, measures to improve healthcare management, increase performance and streamline financial allocation are vulnerable and cannot counteract the effects that the pandemic has on the healthcare of the population as reflected in the morbidity and mortality indicators collected during the pandemic. In this regard, it is necessary a rethinking of the strategic healthcare management, a better planning of the procurement of medicines and healthcare supplies, a rethinking of the partnerships with the European Commission and other global entities. This approach can effectively improve the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare status of the population, a rebalancing of the demand-supply balance in healthcare and a maintenance of the strategic programmes, according to the objectives assumed in the planning, given that these programmes protect categories of people already medically affected.Copyright © 2022 Antohi, Ionescu, Zlati and Mirica.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As a new type of consumer subject in the market that was formerly dominated by multiple person families, single households are driving the change in the buying structure. Food purchase activities have undergone significant changes since the outbreak of the COVID-19. The objective of this study was to assess and compare variations in food consumption, purchase and handling during the COVID-19 pandemic between single person households (SPH) and multiple person households., METHOD: A cross-sectional study conducted among 211 individuals in communities in Harris and Waller Counties, Texas. Sociodemographic, food purchase, food consumption and food handling activities during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed with a validated COVID-19 Nutrition questionnaire., RESULTS: Non-Hispanic Black participants constituted 42.6%, and 28.4% were Hispanics. Participants were made up of mostly aged 18-24 years (39.3%), 47.9% single household composition, 30.4% in full time employment, and 29.1% partook in food assistance programs. A large proportion of them had never used grocery pickup services, online grocery shopping and a farmers' market. During the COVID-19 pandemic, majority of the participants used more of large supermarkets, restaurant/fast food, and online grocery but food consumption seemed to remain the same for the majority of participants. For beverages, majority of participants consumed more water, less soda, and no alcohol. There was a significant association between single person household and higher restaurant/fast foods purchase. Many of the participants reported weight gain and less physical activity during the pandemic., CONCLUSION: Restaurant meal purchases was more prevalent in single-person families. The results from the study have the potential to contribute to how public policy officials, food service, and health authorities forecast how different categories of consumers will react in pandemics and may be used to inform area-specific alleviation strategies to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and future events.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted manifold pressures on the public health framework globally, but it also in a way unified different genres and allowed for strategizing and implementing regulatory decisions as best as possible, especially in India. There is an unmet need for such a unified and integrative approach in the area of scientific publishing which has also been touched by various dilemmas, either emergent or propagated during this pandemic. Objective(s): This article intends to re-visit some of the dilemmas in scientific publishing, which have taken centre stage owing to a healthcare emergency, with the objective of highlighting an unmet need for developing unified criteria for research conduction and publishing from a futuristic view point, as one is not without the other. Content: While a fast track delivery of research data has been a priority for research journals, the due pressures in the process management of the same while skimming the ethical boundaries of responsible mediation through a Journal platform has remained a challenge globally for various reasons. Furthermore, the inevitability of a healthcare emergency inadvertently led to some cumulative off-target effects including accumulation of research waste, diminishing validity of academic metrics, short data set publications, hasty zombie clinical trials publishing merely an overview of the actual data, etc, which are major issues not only for journal Editors or the research community as a whole, but also for regulatory authorities and policy makers. As a step towards future pandemic preparedness, strategizing and streamlining research and publication processes ensuing responsible reporting should be treated as a topic of paramount significance. Hence, through debating on these dilemmas as well as potential integrative approaches, unified guiding criteria in the area of scientific publishing may be developed in lieu of preparedness for such future pandemic scenarios.Copyright © 2023 Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists},

   volume = {79},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   pages = {25-26},
   abstract = {Purpose: Epidemics rank among the most costly and destructive of natural hazards. In the past few years outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, MERS and SARS demonstrated the limited preparedness to respond swiftly and appropriate. This highlight the need to develop more proactive instead of reactive policies Existing frameworks for epidemic response are either disease specific, category specific or nonspecific national models, but so far no model exist that combine all elements. The aim of this study is to create a holistic framework for early warning system for disease outbreaks by identifying the risk factors of epidemics at an early stage. This framework can guide towards evidence based decision making and prioritization. Methods & Materials: INFORM is used as base for the new conceptual framework, as it is recognized by various humanitarian organizations, and shown to be holistic. Literature reviews were conducted to specify the framework specifically for and identify risk factors/indicators of epidemics. The framework is tested by statistical modelling using data from the Philippines as a case study. The model uses existing open data and compares it to the local dengue incidence in the Philippines. The statistical methodology follows the steps to develop a composite indicator according to the 10-step guideline by OECD. Result(s): The results of the first analyses show an association between all dimensions and dengue risk in the Philippines. However, when comparing the dimensions; infectious hazard and exposure, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity, especially the categories behavior and socio-economic risk factors tend to contribute to dengue risk in provinces within the Philippines. Lack of coping capacity contributes to a lesser extent to dengue risk. Further analyses are needed to study the relation. Conclusion(s): The initial results are positive and suggest that further development of a holistic framework is promising. However, it is currently only in the assessment phase for Dengue in the Philippines. Next phases of the study need to determine the applicability to other infectious diseases and the transferability to other countries and how it can be adapted to ensure a holistic framework. Continuous revision and evaluation of the chosen indicators will be necessary to make the framework more robust.Copyright © 2018},

Setting Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants 2108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Response rate was 84.3% (2108/2500). Data collected between 17 March and 18 March 2020. Main outcome measures Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including number of respondents and weighted percentages. Robust Poisson regression used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) ability and (4) willingness to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1992 (94.2%) respondents reported at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 years compared with younger adults aged 18-34 years (adjusted relative risk/aRR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5). Those with lowest household income were three times less likely to be able to work from home (aRR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.45) and less likely to be able to self-isolate (aRR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aRR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.0). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions Ability to adopt and comply with certain non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socioeconomic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 had affected the health-care-seeking behavior of people with chronic medical conditions. The impact is even worse in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the extent and correlates of missed appointments among adults with chronic disease conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Ethiopia., METHODS: A retrospective chart review and cross-sectional survey were conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. A total of 1833 patients with common chronic disease were included by using a stratified systematic random sampling technique. Web-based data collection was done using Kobo collect. The data were explored using descriptive statistical techniques, the rate of missed appointments s before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was determined. A negative binomial regression model was fitted to identify the factors of missed appointment. An incidence rate ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of the final model were reported., RESULTS: The rate of missed appointments was 12.5% (95% CI: 11.13%, 14.20%) before the pandemic, increased to 26.8% (95% CI: 24.73%, 28.82%) during the pandemic (p-value < 0.001). Fear of COVID-19 infection and lack of transport was the most common reasons for missing appointments. Older patients (Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (AIRR) = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.001; 1.015), having treatment follow up more than 5 years (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.103; 1.69), shorter frequency of follow-up (AIRR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63; 2.49), covering expense out of pocket (AIRR = 2.26, 95%CI: 1.41; 2.95), having a sedentary lifestyle (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.12; 1.71), and history of missed appointments before COVID-19 pandemic (AIRR = 4.27, 95%CI: 3.35; 5.43) were positively associated with the incidence of missed appointments., CONCLUSION: The rate of missed appointment increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, longer duration of follow up, more frequent follow-up, out-of-pocket expenditure for health service, history of poor follow-up, and sedentary lifestyle had positive relationship with missed appointments during the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to give special emphasis to individuals with these risk factors while designing and implementing policies and strategies for peoples with chronic diseases to ensure the continuity of care and to avoid the long-term impact on their health.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis which has an enormous impact on the world population and economy. Many scientists and researchers have combined efforts to develop an approach to tackle this crisis and as a result, researchers have developed several approaches for understanding the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the way of mitigating its effect. The implementation of a mathematical model has proven helpful in further understanding the behaviour which has helped the policymaker in adopting the best policy necessary for reducing the spread. Most models are based on a system of equations which assume an instantaneous change in the transmission dynamics. However, it is believed that SARS-COV-2 have an incubation period before the tendency of transmission. Therefore, to capture the dynamics adequately, there would be a need for the inclusion of delay parameters which will account for the delay before an exposed individual could become infected. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the SEIR epidemic model with a convex incidence rate incorporated with a time delay. We first discussed the epidemic model as a form of a classical ordinary differential equation and then the inclusion of a delay to represent the period in which the susceptible and exposed individuals became infectious. Secondly, we identify the disease-free together with the endemic equilibrium state and examine their stability by adopting the delay differential equation stability theory. Thereafter, we carried out numerical simulations with suitable parameters choice to illustrate the theoretical result of the system and for a better understanding of the model dynamics. We also vary the length of the delay to illustrate the changes in the model as the delay parameters change which enables us to further gain an insight into the effect of the included delay in a dynamical system. The result confirms that the inclusion of delay destabilises the system and it forces the system to exhibit an oscillatory behaviour which leads to a periodic solution and it further helps us to gain more insight into the transmission dynamics of the disease and strategy to reduce the risk of infection.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {Background Nationally representative studies evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on haemorrhagic stroke outcomes are lacking. Methods In this pooled cross-sectional analysis, we identified adults (>=18 years) with primary intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) from the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020). We evaluated differences in rates of in-hospital outcomes between the prepandemic (January 2016-February 2020) and pandemic (March-December 2020) periods using segmented logistic regression models. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate differences in mortality between patients admitted from April to December 2020, with and without COVID-19, and those admitted from April to December 2019. Stratified analyses were conducted among patients residing in low-income and high-income zip codes, as well as among patients with extreme loss of function (E-LoF) and those with minor to major loss of function (MM-LoF). Results Overall, 309 965 patients with ICH (47% female, 56% low income) and 112 210 patients with SAH (62% female, 55% low income) were analysed. Prepandemic, ICH mortality decreased by ~1% per month (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 0.99 (0.99 to 1.00); p<0.001). However, during the pandemic, the overall ICH mortality rate increased, relative to prepandemic, by ~2% per month (1.02 (1.00 to 1.04), p<0.05) and ~4% per month (1.04 (1.01 to 1.07), p<0.001) among low-income patients. There was no significant change in trend among high-income patients with ICH (1.00 (0.97 to 1.03)). Patients with comorbid COVID-19 in 2020 had higher odds of mortality (versus 2019 cohort) only among patients with MM-LoF (ICH, 2.15 (1.12 to 4.16), and SAH, 5.77 (1.57 to 21.17)), but not among patients with E-LoF. Conclusion Sustained efforts are needed to address socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access, quality and outcomes during public health emergencies.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

   abstract = {Introduction & Aims: There is a current drive nationally to improve the management of acute ureteric colic. Management targets set by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) include a 4-week target for the time from diagnosis-to-definitive management, or to clinic review in patients managed expectantly. The motivation to review our acute stone service stemmed from concerns that we did not have the capacity to consistently offer primary definitive treatment or timely clinic review to patients. We aimed to restructure our service using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to achieve the BAUS targets. Method(s): All patients diagnosed with a ureteric stone between March and September 2017 were reviewed as a baseline. Our strategy for improvement involved implementing an emergency stone clinic (ESC) model. This was developed through collaboration between the key stakeholders and centred on a weekly consultant-led specialist clinic designed to review and make early management decisions for all patients referred with a ureteric stone meeting pre-agreed criteria. Post-intervention data were collected between June 2018 and January 2019. To assess whether we were able to meet these targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, data were also collected between January 2020 and October 2020. Result(s): Time from CT diagnosis to clinic review reduced from 77 to 9 days. Patients seen within 4 weeks of diagnosis improved from 2.9% to 90.5%. Of those requiring a procedure, the percentage receiving a primary intervention increased to 72.1%. Emergency stent insertion was reduced from 69% to 27.9%. The rate of patient re-presentation to A&E reduced from 3.0 to 1.6 episodes/month. The percentage receiving their definitive procedure within 4 weeks improved from 26.2% to 51.2% in the first post-intervention cycle and remained at 54.5% during the pandemic period. Conclusion(s): Implementing the ESC model led to substantial improvements in patient care and significant progress towards achieving the BAUS management targets while reducing the burden on our Emergency Department.

   volume = {7},
   number = {12},
   pages = {e010242},
   abstract = {The onset of the pandemic revealed the health system inequities and inadequate preparedness, especially in the African continent. Over the past months, African countries have ensured optimum pandemic response. However, there is still a need to build further resilient health systems that enhance response and transition from the acute phase of the pandemic to the recovery interpandemic/preparedness phase. Guided by the lessons learnt in the response and plausible pandemic scenarios, the WHO Regional Office for Africa has envisioned a transition framework that will optimise the response and enhance preparedness for future public health emergencies. The framework encompasses maintaining and consolidating the current response capacity but with a view to learning and reshaping them by harnessing the power of science, data and digital technologies, and research innovations. In addition, the framework reorients the health system towards primary healthcare and integrates response into routine care based on best practices/health system interventions. These elements are significant in building a resilient health system capable of addressing more effectively and more effectively future public health crises, all while maintaining an optimal level of essential public health functions. The key elements of the framework are possible with countries following three principles: equity (the protection of all vulnerable populations with no one left behind), inclusiveness (full engagement, equal participation, leadership, decision-making and ownership of all stakeholders using a multisectoral and transdisciplinary, One Health approach), and coherence (to reduce the fragmentation, competition and duplication and promote logical, consistent programmes aligned with international instruments).Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

We use a global economy-wide model with detailed disaggregation of agricultural and food sectors and develop a business-as-usual baseline for 2020 and 2021 called "But-for-COVID" (BfC). We then shock the model with aggregate income shocks derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook for 2020 and 2021. We impose total-factor productivity losses in key sectors as well as consumption decreases induced by social distancing. The resulting shocks in prices and incomes from the CGE model simulations are fed into the USDA-ERS International Food Security Assessment (IFSA) model to derive the impact of the pandemic on food security in these 80 countries. The main effect of the pandemic was to exacerbate the existing declining trend in food security. Food insecurity increases considerably in countries in Asia through income shocks rather than prices effects. We also review trade policies that were put in place to restrict imports and exports of food, and we evaluate their potential for further disruption of markets focusing on the food-security implications.

   journal = {Pediatric Rheumatology},
   volume = {19},
   number = {SUPPL 1},
   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the traditional inperson healthcare delivery model, prompting a shift to telemedicine to ensure continuity of care for pediatric rheumatology patients. The change to virtual practice affected healthcare provider's assessments of disease activity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) as they were unable to perform hands-on physical assessments. Understanding the impact of this shift is critical to help address any care gaps that are faced during virtual visits for patients with JIA. Objective(s): The objectives of the survey were four-fold: a) understand the impact of the switch from in-person to telemedicine visits from the healthcare provider perspective; b) identify the barriers and facilitators to collecting critical data elements that are important in monitoring JIA disease activity and outcomes; c) identify tools that providers are using during their telemedicine visits to perform disease activity assessments; and d) examine the impact of the telemedicine healthcare delivery on clinical research. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey sent to members from all Pediatric Rheumatology Care and Outcomes Improvement Network (PR-COIN) centers (n=21) with total number of targeted respondents of 121. The survey was sent out for completion between 08/17/2020 - 09/ 02/2020. Quantitative responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative responses were analyzed by content and theme. Result(s): Survey ersponse rate was 98% (n=119) 90% fully completed. Most respondents (99%) indicated that they documented six critical data elements [CDE] (physician global assessment, patient global assessment, active joint count, morning stiffness, arthritis-related pain, and completion of uveitis screen) in 75% of telemedicine visits. Most respondents (74%) indicated that they documented active joint count over 70% of the time, while 30% of respondents reported barriers to documenting active joint count such as inability to palpate joints and the inability to visualize all joints on virtual examination. Identified barriers to assessment and visit documentation included challenges with assessing joint disease activity and platform technical issues. Ten percent of the respondents reported they often forgot to document CDE during telemedicine visits, indicating that setting up automated reminders in their electronic medical records may help with increasing their likelihood of documentation. A few centers reported having processes to assist with the collection of patient data in advance of the visit, such as pre-visitquestionnaires and planning. The ability to perform research activities was significantly impacted with only 37% of centers reported participating in research activities via telemedicine, and 29% reported their ability to consent patients via telemedicine visits. Conclusion(s): There are multiple barriers and facilitators to conducting successful clinical visits as well as performing clinical research over telemedicine. Our data suggests variation in telemedicine practice and process across centers, as well as within each center, reflecting the need to standardize the process of telemedicine visits. Given that a portion of patients with JIA will likely continue to be serviced over telemedicine post-pandemic, teams need to adapt their existing practices to continue providing quality care and integrating clinical research over this platform where appropriate.},

Understanding factors affecting routine use would facilitate escalation to high level use during infectious disease emergencies. This study explored health care workers FPE-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. Method(s): Mixed methods were used in a respiratory ward and adult and pediatric emergency departments (EDs), prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design and thematic analysis were based on the theoretical domains framework. Emergent themes were categorized, using the COM-B behavior model, into capability(C), opportunity(O) and motivation(M), which influence behavior(B). Result(s): 22 emergent themes, representing factors influencing FPE use, were mapped to theoretical domains framework domains. Personal experience and departmental cultures influenced motivation. Compared with respiratory ward staff, ED clinicians were less knowledgeable about FPE; the unique ED environment and culture inhibited opportunities and motivation for FPE use. Eye protection was infrequently used. Discussion(s): Optimal FPE use is challenged by ED care models and settings. Changes are needed to translate pandemic-related improvements into routine care of other respiratory infections. Conclusion(s): This study identified key determinants of FPE behavior. A review of context-specific FPE guidance for ED by infection prevention and control professionals would help to promote practicable, sustainable compliance.Copyright © 2024 The Authors},

   title = {Teaching strategy adaptations in undergraduate dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic},
   journal = {Journal of dental education},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, dental institutions were challenged to rapidly adapt to the inability of teaching in-person lectures and pre-clinical simulations. Strategies had to be quickly developed to guarantee the safety of faculty and students, while also adhering to national guidelines to ensure that educational standards were met and students' graduations and entrance into residency programs were not delayed. This literature review assesses the novel strategies that dental schools created and implemented to teach in a distance-learning platform and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. In addition, this review talks about the lessons learned during the pandemic and the incorporation of successful strategies after the pandemic ended. METHOD(S): This review evaluated the literature using PubMed and ScienceDirect with the following keywords: "teaching strategies," "dental education," and "COVID-19." The search strategy yielded 15 articles that assessed relevant teaching strategies that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT(S): The literature described the swift response of dental institutions in implementing teaching strategies in response to the inability of continuing in-person teaching. An overwhelming majority of institutions moved their didactic lectures to online platforms. Several institutions implemented online simulations with virtual reality models, videos and discussion boards, standardized patient actors, and case-based discussions. CONCLUSION(S): Many of the teaching strategies that were implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly effective. Dental schools were able to satisfy Commission on Dental Accreditation standards and meet students' requirements for graduation during the pandemic despite the rapid and unplanned shift away from in-person instruction and simulation secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2024 American Dental Education Association.},

The purpose of the present article was to cross-examine the ethical codes and guidelines of different, but related fields of practice and to discuss potential implications for telehealth-based ABA service delivery. We reviewed the telehealth-specific ethical codes and guidelines of the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Association of Social Workers, along with the related ABA literature. These organizations addressed several useful and unique ethical concerns that have not been addressed in ABA literature. We also developed a brief checklist for ABA practitioners to evaluate their telehealth readiness by meeting the legal, professional, and ethical requirements of ABA services.

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigated the relationship between cryptocurrency market and hedge funds in two different ways. First, we focus on the dependence between Cryptocurrency hedge funds and conventional hedge funds strategies using VAR and VECM models, while analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the hedge funds' values. Secondly, we choose between ARDL and ARDL-ECM models to study the effects of cryptocurrency price changes on Crypto- Currency hedge funds' values during COVID-19 crisis. Our empirical findings demonstrate that there is substantial interactions between Crypto-Currency and conventional hedge funds. The COVID-19 pandemic has significant negative impact on the performance of the following hedge funds: Event Driven, Relative Value and Distressed Debt fund strategies, this has reflected in a significant drop in their values during this critical period. However, we demonstrate that COVID-19 pandemic did not affect the relationship between crypto-currency hedge funds and both bitcoin and Ethereum. These findings hold profound implications for hedge funds managers, cryptocurrency market main players and policy makers. Our study is crucial in forecasting the performance of these markets especially during global pandemics. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Annals of Emergency Medicine},
   volume = {80},
   number = {4 Supplement},
   pages = {S54},
   abstract = {Study Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for virtual learning opportunities including telesimulation. Many Emergency medicine (EM) simulation directors were forced to halt their in-person simulation curriculum and adapt to telesimulation, but specifics on their utilization practices and plans for future use is unknown. We sought to describe the patterns of telesimulation usage in recent times and its anticipated utility in medical education moving forward. Method(s): We developed a confidential, Web-based survey after literature review, using survey research best practices. The survey consisted of multiple choice and free response items pertaining to use of telesimulation before, during, and after in-person learning restrictions due to COVID-19. The survey was piloted prior to use and disseminated to emergency medicine simulation directors in January-February 2022. Programs were identified via the EMRA Match Web site and simulation director's contact information was obtained via the residency program's Web site if available. When not available on the Web site, contact information was obtained by emailing the program coordinator and/or program director. Result(s): Contact information was obtained for 139 residency simulation directors. Survey response rate was 68% (94/139), with 3 participants opting out of the survey, leaving 91 responses. Seventy percent of respondents were from PGY 1-3 programs and 30% from PGY 1-4 programs. During in-person learning restrictions, 62% (56/91) of programs used some form of telesimulation. Assuming all in-person education restrictions lifted, 38% (34/90) of respondents plan to use telesimulation in some capacity in their curricula, compared to 9% (8/91) who reported they were using telesimulation prior to the pandemic. Most who plan to use telesimulation in the future plan to integrate it with their in-person simulation curricula, using telesimulation for 25% of the time of less (30/34), with only few planning to use telesimulation for more than 25% of their simulation curriculum (4/34). While many different types of simulation cases and activities were trialed using telesimulation, the majority of survey respondents that plan to continue using telesimulation plan to use it for medical knowledge (76%, 26/34) and communication/teamwork focused cases (68%, 23/34), rather than for procedure focused cases (21%, 7/34) or dedicated procedure training (15%, 5/34). Conclusion(s): Despite relatively low use of telesimulation in emergency medicine residencies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, experience using telesimulation during the pandemic has led to an increased number of residency programs who plan to incorporate it into their simulation curricula. This plan for continued use opens opportunities for further innovation and scholarship within this area of simulation education.

   volume = {29},

   pages = {290},
   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health services globally. We examined the self-reported impact of the pandemic on access to HIV and family planning (FP) services among women living with HIV (WLHIV) at a large HIV treatment program in Kenya. Method(s): Telephone surveys were conducted among a non-random, purposeful sample of WLHIV >=15 years of age exposed to dolutegravir (DTG) at HIV clinics affiliated with the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), a PEPFAR-supported treatment program in western Kenya. Participants completing phone interviews for a DTG-focused study named Chaguo Langu were asked structured questions about their HIV and FP experiences and pregnancy intentions in the context of the pandemic. Multivariable logistic models were used to estimate the odds of self-reported difficulty refilling medications and obtaining care, respectively, adjusted for age, partner status, number of children, time on ART, and HIV clinic site. Result(s): Among 814 women called from June-October 2020, 784 (96%) completed the survey. Overall, 14% reported experiencing increased difficulty obtaining care during the pandemic, primarily due to cost or unavailability of transportation (61%). Further, 32% reported increased difficulty refilling medications during the pandemic, primarily due to medication stock-outs (79%). However, only 2% reported missing medication doses. Only 2% reported increased difficulty managing (including initiating, refilling, and removing) FP methods, primarily due to stock-outs of implants and injectables (69%). Most (95%) reported no impact of the pandemic on their intentions to use FP or become pregnant. None of the factors assessed in the multivariable model were associated with difficulty obtaining care. Older women were less likely (aOR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98), and women with a higher number of children were more likely (aOR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.00-1.28) to have an association with difficulty refilling medications. Conclusion(s): A significant proportion of WLHIV report experiencing greater difficulty obtaining HIV care and medication refills during the pandemic, while women's ability to manage FP during the pandemic largely remained stable. Addressing medication stock-outs and transportation challenges may help HIV programs in resource-constrained settings ensure that access to HIV and FP services is not disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continues, FP access and use should continue to be monitored to avoid unintended pregnancies.},

Implementation of this model is happening while many dialysis organizations are still suffering the far-reaching effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition, the model has the potential to negatively affect small and independent dialysis organizations disproportionately. It incentivizes home dialysis over transplant and promotes development of new home dialysis programs, rewards achievement over improvement, and places an excessive burden on small and independent dialysis organizations. Advantages of the program include the focus on self-care as an acceptable alternative to home dialysis for some patients and the potential for some organizations to make improvements in care with increased reimbursements. The authors hope that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will address many of these concerns in updated rulemaking and guidance.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   number = {2_suppl},
   abstract = {Background: In the era of new normal life after Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), our children are experiencing the double threat of COVID-19 and Childhood Obesity (CO-BESITY). The rate of childhood obesity has been rapidly increasing in developed as well as low middle-income countries during the pandemic. Design and Methods: The current paper aims to identify the probable reasons of increase in childhood obesity during this pandemic and offers suggestions to reduce the burden of it. Literature search was done using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases for the key terms "childhood obesity," "obesity," "pandemic," and/or childhood obesity. All the relevant articles were included to support the argument for this viewpoint. Result(s): Childhood obesity is a complicated disorder having diverse outcomes. The incidence of childhood obesity is analysed from Bronfenbrenner's model of child development. The model examines an overabundance of bio-psycho-social backgrounds, risks, and probable outcomes on the development of a child. COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the ecosystem of this dynamic model and has created an economic and social-cultural crisis that has ignited a chain reaction of stressors upon children and their families. In this paper, we have described how this Bronfenbrenner's model of child development also known as the Bioecological Model can be effective for the estimation and prevention of childhood obesity. Conclusion(s): We propose that this Bioecological Model will help the children and their families further understand and manage the problem of childhood obesity during this pandemic on their own.Copyright © 2021 SAGE Publications Ltd unless otherwise noted.},

   abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 has disrupted the efficiency of hospitals nationwide. Ambulant trauma surgery was minimised to reduce risk of contracting COVID-19. Operating capacity significantly reduced and surgical training dramatically curtailed. Locally, a private hospital has been utilised as a green site with consultant-lead trauma lists. Our aim is to review the safety and efficiency of this service. Method(s): Patients underwent pre-assessment, COVID-19 swabs and 7 days isolation pre and post-op. Staff also underwent swabbing. Prospectively data was gathered for all patients operated on at this site from 12/05/2020 to 20/08/2020. Records reviewed for readmission, complications and COVID status. A satisfaction questionnaire was sent to trainees who operated at this site. Result(s): 79 operations were completed during this period. 50 male and 29 female, average age 49, average ASA 2. No complications or COVID-19 infections were recorded. Mean time to theatre was 18 days. Delays to theatre led to 2 complications. 87% of trainees felt training was maintained. Conclusion(s): Establishing a green site enabled efficient and safe management whilst still facilitating surgical training. This requires clear guidelines for staff and patients. We believe this model can help trauma service provision as the pandemic evolves.},

To cope with the disruption, digital solutions have become more popular. However, the ability to adopt digitalised alternatives is different across socio-economic and socio-demographic groups., Objective: This study investigates how individuals have changed their activity-travel patterns and internet usage during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic period, and which of these changes may be kept., Methods: An empirical data collection was deployed through online forms. 781 responses from different countries (Italy, Sweden, India and others) have been collected, and a series of multivariate analyses was carried out. Two linear regression models are presented, related to the change of travel activities and internet usage, before and during the pandemic period. Furthermore, a binary regression model is used to examine the likelihood of the respondents to adopt and keep their behaviours beyond the pandemic period., Results: The results show that the possibility to change the behaviour matter. External restrictions and personal characteristics are the driving factors of the reduction in ones' daily trips. However, the estimation results do not show a strong correlation between the countries' restriction policy and the respondents' likelihood to adopt the new and online-based behaviours for any of the activities after the restriction period., Conclusion: The acceptance and long-term adoption of the online alternatives for activities are correlated with the respondents' personality and socio-demographic group, highlighting the importance of promoting alternatives as a part of longer-term behavioural and lifestyle changes.

   abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widescale use of clinical simulations to improve procedures and practices. We outline our deployment of a virtual tabletop simulation (TTS) method in primary care (PC) clinics across Alberta, Canada. We summarise the quality and safety improvements from this method and report end users' perspectives on key elements. Methods Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. Results These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. Discussion TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices. While our sessions were conducted in Alberta, our results suggest this method may be deployed in other contexts, including low-resource settings.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

   abstract = {We present a simple, near-real-time Bayesian method to infer and forecast a multiwave outbreak, and demonstrate it on the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach uses timely epidemiological data that has been widely available for COVID-19. It provides short-term forecasts of the outbreak's evolution, which can then be used for medical resource planning. The method postulates one- and multiwave infection models, which are convolved with the incubation-period distribution to yield competing disease models. The disease models' parameters are estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and information-theoretic criteria are used to select between them for use in forecasting. The method is demonstrated on two- and three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks in California, New Mexico and Florida, as observed during Summer-Winter 2020. We find that the method is robust to noise, provides useful forecasts (along with uncertainty bounds) and that it reliably detected when the initial single-wave COVID-19 outbreaks transformed into successive surges as containment efforts in these states failed by the end of Spring 2020.

   abstract = {Background: Predicting early respiratory failure due to COVID-19 can help triage patients to higher levels of care, allocate scarce resources, and reduce morbidity and mortality by appropriately monitoring and treating the patients at greatest risk for deterioration. Given the complexity of COVID-19, machine learning approaches may support clinical decision making for patients with this disease. Objective(s): Our objective is to derive a machine learning model that predicts respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission based on data from the emergency department. Method(s): Data were collected from patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Northwell Health acute care hospitals and were discharged, died, or spent a minimum of 48 hours in the hospital between March 1 and May 11, 2020. Of 11,525 patients, 933 (8.1%) were placed on invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of admission. Variables used by the models included clinical and laboratory data commonly collected in the emergency department. We trained and validated three predictive models (two based on XGBoost and one that used logistic regression) using cross-hospital validation. We compared model performance among all three models as well as an established early warning score (Modified Early Warning Score) using receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, and other metrics. Result(s): The XGBoost model had the highest mean accuracy (0.919; area under the curve=0.77), outperforming the other two models as well as the Modified Early Warning Score. Important predictor variables included the type of oxygen delivery used in the emergency department, patient age, Emergency Severity Index level, respiratory rate, serum lactate, and demographic characteristics. Conclusion(s): The XGBoost model had high predictive accuracy, outperforming other early warning scores. The clinical plausibility and predictive ability of XGBoost suggest that the model could be used to predict 48-hour respiratory failure in admitted patients with COVID-19.Copyright © Siavash Bolourani, Max Brenner, Ping Wang, Thomas McGinn, Jamie S Hirsch, Douglas Barnaby, Theodoros P Zanos, Northwell COVID-19 Research Consortium.},

Little is known if these changes are associated with changes in physical or mental health. Method(s): Between September 2017 and December 2018 (baseline) and March 2020 and February 2021 (follow-up), we obtained self-reported demographic, health, and walking (only at follow-up) data on 2042 adults in primary care with multiple chronic health conditions. We examined whether the perceived amount of time engaged in walking was different compared with prepandemic levels and if this was associated with changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 mental and physical health summary scores. Multivariable linear regression controlling for demographic, health, and neighborhood information were used to assess this association. Result(s): Of the 2042 participants, 9% reported more walking, 28% reported less, and 52% reported the same amount compared with prepandemic levels. Nearly 1/3 of participants reported less walking during the pandemic. Multivariable models revealed that walking less or not at all was associated with negative changes in mental (s = -1.0; 95% CI [-1.6, -0.5]; s = -2.2; 95% CI [-2.9, -1.4]) and physical (s = -0.9; 95% CI [-1.5, -0.3]; s = -3.1; 95% CI [-4.0, -2.3]) health, respectively. Increasing walking was significantly associated with a positive change in physical health (s = 1.3; 95% CI [0.3, 2.2]). Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate the importance of walking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

   title = {Philippine food retail amidst COVID-19 pandemic: A thematic analysis},
   journal = {Obesity Reviews},
   volume = {23},
   number = {Supplement 2},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in food supply chains and food processing, changes in economic activities, and reduced access to food alongside changes in food purchasing patterns. The several pandemic waves have transformed the food retailers' business models, paving the way for better resilience and recovery. Thus, this study aims to characterize the Philippine food retail landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic with the ultimate goal of documenting pathways to recovery and resilience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published news articles from top three news sites (ABS-CBN News, GMA Network, and Philippine Daily Inquirer) based on the Reuters Institute ranking and government websites were utilized as sources of data published from March to December 2020. A total of 240 articles were gathered and 93 articles were deemed unique after filtering for redundancies and relevance. The study narrowed down with the search terms COVID AND food retail, COVID AND market, COVID AND food supply, and COVID AND food. Data collected were qualitatively analyzed using Leximan-cer software utilizing a machine learning technique. A PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) analysis was also conducted to analyze the macro-environment factors within the food retail system during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT(S): Results show that seven main themes emerge: lockdown, food, pandemic, market, access, digital, and cash. The PESTEL analysis reveal that: (1) Satellite palengkes proved to be a novel solution among the populated cities of the National Capital Region; (2) Despite the economic recession, the Philippine food retail industry was observed to be thriving; (3) Social efforts from the private sector significantly aided Filipinos in these trying times; and (4) Food related enterprises managed to survive by immersing in the online platform and omni-channel retailing. CONCLUSION(S): These results indicate that although the Philippine food retail has thrived amidst the crisis, potential improvements can be done through better food retail policies.},

   abstract = {Objective: We examine the impact of financial distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychological well-being. Method(s): We analyze cross-sectional survey data (n = 2,545) from the Life during Pandemic study in Chile. We estimate linear probability models to analyze the relationship between economic fragility, financial distress, and psychological well-being. Result(s): Our findings show unemployment and income loss are highly predictive of experiencing a range of financial problems, such as a lack of savings, as well as difficulties paying bills, consumer debt, and mortgage loans. In turn, financial distress leads to a higher prevalence of poor well-being and mental health deterioration, and sleep problems. Conclusion(s): Expansion of mental health assistance services are needed, as new diagnosis of mental health conditions has increased, but treatment has not, pointing to a barrier in the access to some mental health care services during the pandemic. Policies designed with the objective of improving financial education are necessary to increase precautionary savings and financial resilience, and alleviate the psychological burden of debt in the future.Copyright © 2022 Borrescio-Higa, Droller and Valenzuela.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper describes a methodology for gathering requirements and early design of remote monitoring technology (RMT) for enhancing patient safety during pandemics using virtual care technologies. As pandemics such as COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) progress there is an increasing need for effective virtual care and RMT to support patient care while they are at home. METHOD(S): The authors describe their work in conducting literature reviews by searching PubMed.gov and the grey literature for articles, and government websites with guidelines describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the progression of the disease. The reviews focused on identifying gaps where RMT could be applied in novel ways and formed the basis for the subsequent modelling of use cases for applying RMT described in this paper. RESULT(S): The work was conducted in the context of a new Home of the Future laboratory which has been set up at the University of Victoria. The literature review led to the development of a number of object-oriented models for deploying RMT. This modeling is being used for a number of purposes, including for education of students in health infomatics as well as testing of new use cases for RMT with industrial collaborators and projects within the smart home of the future laboratory. CONCLUSION(S): Object-oriented modeling, based on analysis of gaps in the literature, was found to be a useful approach for describing, communicating and teaching about potential new uses of RMT.Copyright IMIA and Thieme.

   abstract = {This expert review offers an analysis of the global governance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic is not only a health crisis but also a crisis of global governance. For example, the nation states in dealing with the crises of the pandemic have turned inwards, toward native and national solutions, and therefore away from the much-needed global cooperation to respond to the pandemic. This is an important concern for systems medicine and integrative biology in both normative and instrumental sense. Moreover, if we are to "pandemic-proof"the planet and the life science innovation ecosystem, new ways of understanding global governance are called for. This article examines the ways in which national governments have reacted to the crises triggered and embodied by the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaces the different approaches and conflicts between scientific experts and policy makers, and reveals the failure of science and politics. I analyze the uneven and disjointed way Western democratic governments have responded to the crisis and the way unchecked normative values and ideas have influenced the pandemic policy and prevented effective measures to contain the pandemic. Finally, the complex relationships between politics, knowledge, science, and governments are explored and clarified, and the way the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the long-standing tensions between technocracy and democracy. In conclusion, it is time to think critically and reflexively for all knowledge actors in systems science and innovate both planetary health and its global governance.© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

   abstract = {In this paper we examine resiliency, the ability to absorb and recover from economic shocks, in 199 Nuts-3 regions in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) following the 2008 global financial crisis. We find evidence of strong positive regional spillovers, meaning that regions tend to form clusters of high-performing and low-performing areas, a process that exacerbates regional income disparities. Using the experience of the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, we simulate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ability of these, and, by extension, other upper-middle-income countries to recover from a shock to employment caused by the incidence of COVID-19. Using our recoverability equation estimates, we find that employment in no more than 31 of the 199 regions will have fully recovered in 2 years after the onset of the recovery from the crisis.

   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {11},
   pages = {570567},
   abstract = {The governmental lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic have forced people to change their behavior in many ways including changes in exercise. We used the brief window of global lockdown in the months of March/April/May 2020 as an opportunity to investigate the effects of externally imposed restrictions on exercise-related routines and related changes in subjective well-being. Statistical analyses are based on data from 13,696 respondents in 18 countries using a cross-sectional online survey. A mixed effects modeling approach was used to analyze data. We tested whether exercise frequency before and during the pandemic would influence mood during the pandemic. Additionally, we used the COVID-19 pandemic data to build a prediction model, while controlling for national differences, to estimate changes in exercise frequency during similar future lockdown conditions depending on prelockdown exercise frequency. According to the prediction model, those who rarely exercise before a lockdown tend to increase their exercise frequency during it, and those who are frequent exercisers before a lockdown tend to maintain it. With regards to subjective well-being, the data show that those who exercised almost every day during this pandemic had the best mood, regardless of whether or not they exercised prepandemic. Those who were inactive prepandemic and slightly increased their exercise frequency during the pandemic, reported no change in mood compared to those who remained inactive during the pandemic. Those who reduced their exercise frequency during the pandemic reported worse mood compared to those who maintained or increased their prepandemic exercise frequency. This study suggests that under similar lockdown conditions, about two thirds of those who never or rarely exercise before a lockdown might adopt an exercise behavior or increase their exercise frequency. However, such changes do not always immediately result in improvement in subjective well-being. These results may inform national policies, as well as health behavior and exercise psychology research on the importance of exercise promotion, and prediction of changes in exercise behavior during future pandemics.

   journal = {Renewable & sustainable energy reviews},
   volume = {182},
   pages = {113378},
   abstract = {The Covid-19 outbreak raised great attention to the importance of indoor air quality in buildings. Even if the Covid-19 epidemic is nearing an end, all stakeholders agree that increasing outside air flow rates is beneficial for decreasing the likelihood of contagion, lowering the risk of future pandemics, and enhancing the general safety of the interior environment. Indeed, diverse concerns raised about whether the ventilation standards in place are still adequate. In this context, this research intends to assess the suitability of current ventilation standards in addressing the current pandemic scenario and to offer novel criteria and guidelines for the design and operation of HVAC systems, as well as useful guidance for the creation of future ventilation standards in a post-Covid-19 scenario. To that end, a comprehensive analysis of the ANSI/ASHRAE 62.1 is carried out, with an emphasis on its effectiveness in reducing the risk of infection. Furthermore, the efficacy of various ventilation strategies in reducing the likelihood of contagion has been investigated. Finally, because building ventilation is inextricably linked to energy consumption, the energy and economic implications of the proposed enhancements have been assessed. To carry out the described analysis, a novel method was developed that combines Building Energy Modelling (BEM) and virus contagion risk assessment. The analyses conducted produced interesting insights and criteria for ventilation system design and operation, as well as recommendations for the development of future standards.

   abstract = {In this study, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food retail supply chains (SCs) and their resilience. Based on real-life pandemic scenarios encountered in Germany, we develop and use a discrete-event simulation model to examine SC operations and performance dynamics with the help of anyLogistix digital SC twin. The computational results show that food retail SC resilience at the upheaval times is triangulated by the pandemic intensity and associated lockdown/shutdown governmental measures, inventory-ordering dynamics in the SC, and customer behaviours. We observe that surges in demand and supplier shutdowns have had the highest impact on SC operations and performance, whereas the impact of transportation disruptions was rather low. Transportation costs have spiked because of chaotic inventory-ordering dynamics leading to more frequent and irregular shipments. On bright side, we observe the demand growth and utilization of online sales channels yielding higher revenues. We propose several directions and practical implementation guidelines to improve the food retail SC resilience. We stress the importance of SC digital twins and end-to-end visibility along with resilient demand, inventory, and capacity management. The outcomes of our study can be instructive for enhancing the resilience of food retail SCs in preparation for future pandemics and pandemic-like crises. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Objective This study aimed to explore the British public's healthcare-seeking beliefs concerning eye symptoms, and assess how the first COVID-19 lockdown influenced these. Methods and analysis An anonymous web-based survey was disseminated through mailing lists and social media between June and August 2020. The survey sought participants' views on the severity and urgency of the need for medical review for four ophthalmic and two general medical scenarios on a five-point scale. Participants were asked to answer questions twice: once ignoring the COVID-19 pandemic, and once taking this into account, with additional questions asked to identify factors influencing the decision to seek medical attention and ward admission. Results A total of 402 participants completed the survey (mean age 61.6 years, 63.1% female and 87.7% of white ethnicity). Scores for symptom severity and urgency of medical review increased significantly with the severity of the clinical scenario (both p<0.001). However, participants gave significantly lower scores for the urgency of medical attention when accounting for the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with no pandemic) for all scenarios (all p<0.001). Younger age, greater deprivation and non-white ethnicity were correlated with a lower perception of seriousness and urgency of medical attention. Conclusions During the first UK lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced urgency of medical review for ocular and systemic pathologies was reported in response to the pandemic, which represents a barrier to healthcare-seeking behaviour. This has the potential to critically delay medical review and timely management, negatively impacting patient outcomes.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

   abstract = {Turkey reported its first COVID-19 case on March 10, 2020. We present here the mitigation efforts Turkey has undertaken so far, and also review the lessons learned for future proactive strategies. High number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, national treatment algorithms, governmental support for free testing and medications, tedious contact-tracing with early detection and isolation of cases together with early shelter-in-place for the elderly and youngsters, and subsequent weekend curfews in selected cities have so far prevented the surge pressure on the health care system. At this phase, Turkey needs to adopt an evidence-based, proactive control system for an effective transition process to normalize the situation. Here, we underline the urgent need for detailed analysis of the national COVID-19 data and propose an epidemiologic investigation framework for better understanding, efficient control, and reliable forecasting of COVID-19 pandemic.

   abstract = {Background: Drug supply disruptions have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for medicines used in the ICU. Despite reported shortages in wealthy countries, global analyses of ICU drug purchasing during COVID-19 are limited. Research Question: Has COVID-19 impacted global drug purchases of first-, second-, and third-choice agents used in intensive care? Study Design and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional time series study in a global pharmacy sales dataset comprising approximately 60% of the world's population. We analyzed pandemic-related changes in units purchased per 1,000 population for 69 ICU agents. Interventional autoregressive integrated moving average models tested for significant changes when the pandemic was declared (March 2020) and during its first stage from April through August 2020, globally and by development status. Result(s): Relative to 2019, ICU drug purchases increased by 23.6% (95% CI, 7.9%-37.9%) in March 2020 (P < .001) and then decreased by 10.3% (95% CI, -16.9% to -3.5%) from April through August (P = .006). Purchases for second-choice medicines changed the most, especially in developing countries (eg, 29.3% increase in March 2020). Despite similar relative changes (P = .88), absolute purchasing rates in developing nations remained low. The observed decrease from April through August 2020 was significant only in developed countries (-13.1%; 95% CI, -17.4% to -4.4%; P < .001). Country-level variation seemed unrelated to expected demand and health care infrastructure. Interpretation(s): Purchases for intensive care medicines increased globally in the month of the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, but before peak infection rates. These changes were most pronounced for second-choice agents, suggesting that inexpensive, generic medicines may be purchased more easily in anticipation of pandemic-related ICU surges. Nevertheless, disparities in access persisted. Trends seemed unrelated to expected demand, and decreased purchasing from April through August 2020 may suggest overbuying. National and international policies are needed to ensure equitable drug purchasing during future pandemics.Copyright © 2021 American College of Chest Physicians},

Flight bans, new regulations, and restrictions increase consumer complaints and are emerging as a big problem for airline companies. Understanding the main reasons triggering complaints and eliminating service failures in the airline industry will be a vital strategic priority for businesses, while reviewing the dimensions of service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an excellent opportunity for academic literature. In this study, 10,594 complaints against two major airlines that offer full-service and low-cost options were analyzed with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to categorize them by essential topics. Results provide valuable information for both. Furthermore, this study fills the gap in the existing literature by proposing a decision support system to identify significant service failures through passenger complaints in the airline industry utilizing e-complaints during an unusual situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

   journal = {Journal of community health},
   abstract = {People surviving cancer represent a particularly vulnerable population who are at a higher risk for food insecurity (FI) due to the adverse short- and long-term effects of cancer treatment. This analysis examines the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of FI among cancer survivors across New York State (NYS). Data from the 2019 and 2021 NYS Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used to estimate the prevalence of FI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore socioeconomic determinants of FI. Among cancer survivors, FI varied geographically with a higher prevalence in New York City compared to the rest of the state (ROS) prior to (25.3% vs. 13.8%; p=.0025) and during the pandemic (27.35% vs. 18.52%; p=0.0206). In the adjusted logistic regression model, pre-pandemic FI was associated with non-White race (OR 2.30 [CI 1.16-4.56]), household income <$15,000 (OR 22.67 [CI 6.39-80.43]) or $15,000 to less than <$25,000 (OR 22.99 [CI 6.85-77.12]), and more co-morbidities (OR 1.39 [CI 1.09-1.77]). During the pandemic, the association of FI with non-White race (OR 1.76 [CI 0.98-3.16]) was attenuated but remained significant for low household income and more co-morbidities. FI was newly associated with being out of work for less than one year (OR 6.36 [CI 1.80-22.54] and having one (OR 4.42 [CI 1.77-11.07]) or two or more children in the household (OR 4.54 [CI 1.78-11.63]). Our findings highlight geographic inequities and key determinants of FI among cancer survivors that are amendable to correction by public health and social policies, for which several were momentarily implemented during the pandemic.Copyright © 2024.

Preferences feature a "fear of death" that lead individuals to reduce their social activity and work time in the face of the pandemic. The aggregate effect of these reductions is to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. We calibrate the model, including public policies, to developments in Ontario in the spring of 2020. The model fits the epidemiological data quite well, including the second wave starting in late 2020. We find that socioeconomic interventions work well in the short term, resulting in a rapid drop-off in new cases. The long run, however, is governed chiefly by health developments. Welfare cost calculations point to synergies between the health and socioeconomic measures. Copyright © The Authors.

Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Implementing these new technologies presents individual-level, population-level, and health systems-level opportunities and challenges.Recent findingsTo optimize LAHTP implementation and impact, decision-makers should define and gather relevant data to inform their investment case within the existing health systems context. Programmatic observations from scale-up of antiretroviral therapy, oral preexposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision, and family planning offer lessons as planning begins for implementation of LAHTP. Additional data intelligence should be derived from formative studies, pragmatic clinical trials, epidemiologic and economic modeling of LAHTP. Key implementation issues that need to be addressed include optimal communication strategies for demand creation; target setting; logistics and supply chain of commodities needed for LAHTP delivery; human resource planning; defining and operationalizing monitoring and evaluating metrics; integration into health systems.SummarySuccessful LAHTP implementation can bolster treatment and prevention coverage levels if implementation issues outlined above are proactively addressed in parallel with research and development so that health systems can more rapidly integrate new technologies as they gain regulatory approval.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Such preparation needs community policy involvement at grassroots levels and needs to be collaboratively instigated at international levels. The death so far of over 2000 nurses is unacceptable in this pandemic, and we need to better protect and sustain the workforce. The International Council of Nurses has been instrumental in data gathering of nurses' experiences during COVID-19. Key points from analysis of this data have been included in Second Progress Report of the World Health Organization's Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. This paper summarises the key messages from this report, as well as the nursing shortage.

   pages = {41-46},
   abstract = {Objective: To determine the frequency and distinguishing imaging characteristics of breast cancers detected on screening mammography which was initially evaluated as a probably benign lesion and the workup was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): REB-approved multicenter retrospective screening mammography studies and patient's chart review carried out between February 2020 and March 2020. According to an institutional decision, the frequency and imaging findings deemed probably benign on screening mammography after review by a breast fellowship-trained radiologist with workup deferred until after the first pandemic wave plateau in late July 2020 were recorded. Results were correlated with histopathology if tissue sample performed or an uneventful 2 years follow-up. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to describe the retrieved data set. Result(s): Out of 1816 mammography screening between February 2020 and March 2020, 99 women, median age 58 years (range 35-84), 99 mammography had possibly benign findings with workup delayed, and two patients, age 49 and 56, had cancers (2.02%), misinterpreted as benign findings. Both malignant cases were focal asymmetries, with pathology of invasive ductal carcinoma, 12 mm and 9 mm in size. No in-situ carcinoma was detected. Conclusion(s): The low rate of cancer detected suggests that a delay callback may be a reasonable option for some likely benign findings when immediate callback is not an option, such as during a pandemic. Larger studies would be helpful to support our findings and may allow us to translate the adoption of such a model during potential future pandemic. Clinical relevance: The results of this study may be helpful for a future situation when delaying a call back from screening mammography is again required.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

The parameters of the SIR setting are calibrated to COVID-19 data from China. Using the model, we illustrate how the pandemic could result in consumption and output loss. We show that a combination of quarantine policy and random testing of the uninfected is effective in reducing the number of infected individuals and outperforms the alternative scenarios in which only one of the policies is implemented. Moreover, the economic impacts of both policies are evaluated. Compared with the decentralized equilibrium, we find that the Ramsey social planner allows output to decrease more substantially during the pandemic, in exchange for a faster economic recovery.

A linear model was used to predict the influence of exercise frequency before and during the pandemic on mood states during the pandemic. A total of 71.2%, 67.3%, and 58.3% of respondents maintained their exercise intensity, frequency, and duration, respectively, during the pandemic. Frequent exercisers are more likely to maintain their exercise frequency during a similar pandemic (p < 0.001). Higher exercise frequencies during the pandemic were associated with better mood states (p < 0.05). Moreover, the effects of prepandemic exercise frequency on mood states are moderated by changes in exercise frequency during the pandemic (p < 0.05). Additionally, maintenance of exercise frequency during a pandemic specifically for frequent exercisers are recommended to preserve mood states. These results may provide evidence for health policies on exercise promotion and mental health before and during a future pandemic.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   abstract = {Virologic failure may occur because of poor treatment adherence and/or viral drug resistance mutations (DRM). In Brazil, the northern region exhibits the worst epidemiological scenarios for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, this study is aimed at investigating the genetic diversity of HIV-1 and DRM in Manaus. The cross-sectional study included people living with HIV on combined antiretroviral therapy and who had experienced virological failure during 2018-2019. Sequencing of the protease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) and C2V3 of the viral envelope gp120 (Env) regions was analyzed to determine subtypes/variants of HIV-1, DRMs, and tropism. Ninety-two individuals were analyzed in the study. Approximately 72% of them were male and 74% self-declared as heterosexual. Phylogenetic inference (PR/RT-Env) showed that most sequences were B subtype, followed by BF1 or BC mosaic genomes and few F1 and C sequences. Among the variants of subtype B at PR/RT, 84.3% were pandemic (BPAN), and 15.7% were Caribbean (BCAR). The DRMs most frequent were M184I/V (82.9%) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), K103N/S (63.4%) for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and V82A/L/M (7.3%) for protease inhibitors (PI). DRM analysis depicted high levels of resistance for lamivudine and efavirenz in over 82.9% of individuals; although, low (7.7%) cross-resistance to etravirine was observed. A low level of resistance to protease inhibitors was found and included patients that take atazanavir/ritonavir (16.6%) and lopinavir (11.1%), which confirms that these antiretrovirals can be used - for most individuals. The thymidine analog mutations-2 (TAM-2) resistance pathway was higher in BCAR than in BPAN. Similar results from other Brazilian studies regarding HIV drug resistance were observed; however, we underscore a need for additional studies regarding subtype BCAR variants. Molecular epidemiology studies are an important tool for monitoring the prevalence of HIV drug resistance and can influence the public health policies.Copyright © 2021 Yury Oliveira Chaves et al.},

   journal = {Environmental Pollution},
   volume = {283},
   pages = {117074},
   abstract = {During the current pandemic, chemical disinfectants are ubiquitously and routinely used in community environments, especially on common touch surfaces in public settings, as a means of controlling the virus spread. An underappreciated risk in current regulatory guidelines and scholarly discussions, however, is that the persisting input of chemical disinfectants can exacerbate the growth of biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on those surfaces and allow their direct transfers to humans. For COVID-19, the most commonly used disinfecting agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol, which account for two-thirds of the active ingredients in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for the novel coronavirus. Tolerance to each of these compounds, which can be either intrinsic or acquired, has been observed on various bacterial pathogens. Of those, mutations and horizontal gene transfer, upregulation of efflux pumps, membrane alteration, and biofilm formation are the common mechanisms conferring biocide tolerance in bacteria. Further, the linkage between disinfectant use and antibiotic resistance was suggested in laboratory and real-life settings. Evidence showed that substantial bacterial transfers to hands could effectuate from short contacts with surrounding surfaces and further from fingers to lips. While current literature on disinfectant-induced antimicrobial resistance predominantly focuses on municipal wastes and the natural environments, in reality the community and public settings are most severely impacted by intensive and regular chemical disinfecting during COVID-19 and, due to their proximity to humans, biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerged in these environments may pose risks of direct transfers to humans, particularly in densely populated urban communities. Here we highlight these risk factors by reviewing the most pertinent and up-to-date evidence, and provide several feasible strategies to mitigate these risks in the scenario of a prolonging pandemic.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proved a globally prevalent outbreak since December 2019. As a focused country to alleviate the epidemic impact, China implemented a range of public health interventions to prevent the disease from further transmission, including the pandemic lockdown in Wuhan and other cities. This paper establishes China's mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic. This approach is successfully applied to a network of Chinese provinces and the epidemic strength is smoothly interpreted by flow maps. Through this node-to-node interpretation of transmission risks, both overall and detailed epidemic hazards are properly analyzed, which can provide valuable intervention advice during public health emergencies.Copyright © 2020 Public Library of Science.

   abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization has declared the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Given the sudden infection from and extensive dispersion of COVID-19 and the absence of specific drugs, those infected are in danger if they are not treated in time. Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Subjects and methods: Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. Result(s): Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Conclusion(s): The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.Copyright © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia},

Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP)-the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language-can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding is the optimal infant nutrition, providing infants immunoprotection against many diseases including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected breastfeeding practices in maternity care facilities. The aims of the study were to examine exclusive breastfeeding rates at discharge over time and to identify factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding during the pandemic. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey was conducted among mothers who gave birth in a maternity care facility in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The socio-ecological model was employed to examine intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, and community/society factors associated with maternal report of exclusive breastfeeding at the time of discharge. RESULT(S): There were 26,709 participating mothers from 17 European Region countries who were included in the analysis. Among the mothers, 72.4% (n=19,350) exclusively breastfed and 27.6% (n=7,359) did not exclusively breastfeed at discharge. There was an overall decline in exclusive breastfeeding rates over time (p=0.015) with a significantly lower rate following the publication of the WHO breastfeeding guidelines on 23 June 2020 (AOR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82, 0.94). Factors significantly associated with exclusive breastfeeding outcomes in the logistic regression analysis included maternal age, parity, education, health insurance, mode of birth, inadequate breastfeeding support, lack of early breastfeeding initiation, lack of full rooming-in, birth attendant, perceived healthcare professionalism and attention, facility room cleanliness, timing of birth, and location of birth. CONCLUSION(S): Results from the study indicate the decline in exclusive breastfeeding rates in the WHO European Region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the socio-ecological model to identify factors associated with breastfeeding outcomes facilitates an integrated and holistic approach to address breastfeeding needs among women across the region. These findings demonstrate the need to augment breastfeeding support and to protect exclusive breastfeeding among mother-infant dyads, in an effort to reverse the declining exclusive breastfeeding rates. The study highlights the need to educate mothers and their families about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, reduce maternal-infant separation, increase professional breastfeeding support, and follow evidence-based practice guidelines to promote breastfeeding in a comprehensive and multi-level manner.

   abstract = {COVID-19 is considered as a major public health problem caused by the SARS CoV-2. This Viral infection is known to induce worldwide pandemic in short period of time. Emerging evidence suggested that the transmission control and drug therapy may influence the preventive measures extensively as the host surrounding environment and pathogenic mechanism may contribute to the pandemic condition earlier in COVID-19 disease. Although, several animals identified as reservoir to date, however human-to-human transmission is well documented. Human beings are sustaining the virus in the communities and act as an amplifier of the virus. Human activities i.e., living with the patient, touching patient waste etc. in the surrounding of active patients or asymptomatic persons cause significant risk factors for transmission. On the other hand, drug target and mechanism to destroy the virus or virus inhibition depends on diversified approaches of drugs and different target for virus life cycle. This article describes the sustainable chemical preventive models understanding, requirements, technology adaptation and the implementation strategies in these pandemic-like situations. As the outbreak progresses, healthcare models focused on transmission control through disinfections and sanitization based on risk calculations. Identification of the most suitable target of drugs and regional control model of transmission are of high priority. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of epidemiological information is important to encourage preventive measures efforts by public health authorities and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. Here, we have discussed the level of adaptations in technology that research professionals display toward their public health preventive models. We should compile a representative data set of adaptations that humans can consider for transmission control and adopt for viruses and their hosts. Overall, there are many aspects of the chemical science and technology in virus preventive measures. Herein, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the sustainable preventive model are presented. This kind of sustainable preventive model having adaptation and implementation with green chemistry system will reduce the shedding of the virus into the community by eco-friendly methods, and thus the risk of transmission and infection progression can be mitigated.Copyright © 2021 Indian Chemical Society},

   title = {REDUCING BURDEN OF AMBULATORY CARE IN ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES - A COHORT STUDY},
   journal = {Heart},
   volume = {108},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   pages = {A18-A19},
   abstract = {Introduction Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are a growing, heterogeneous group requiring lifelong follow-up to detect occurrence of known complications. In contrast to other cardiovascular disorders and chronic conditions, those with ACHD generally remain within the specialist tertiary hospital setting throughout their lives. The costs and burden on the patient of outpatient healthcare are increasingly recognised in the wider healthcare setting. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate present ambulatory healthcare in ACHD for ability to detect clinically relevant problems and consider patient and service provider costs. An additional aim was to define levels of non-attendance. We also summarise clinic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic when a hybrid approach of virtual and face to face consultations were arranged according to clinician perceived priority.Methods The clinic attendances of 100 patients attending the general ACHD clinic, selected by hospital number to minimise bias, were reviewed over a five-year period (1/01/2014-30/11/2019) and the Covid 19 period (23/03/2020-23/07/2021) by interrogation of the electronic patient record. This period represented 1/6 of their total lifetime clinic attendance. Results100 patients (Table 1) were invited to clinic annually. Non-attendance was 10% with 15 patients recurrently non-attending. 80% (459/ 575) of appointments resulted in no decision other than continued review (Figure 1). Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were performed frequently but new findings were rare (5.1% and 4.0%). Other investigations required separate attendance. Decision-making was more common with higher ACHD AP class and new symptoms. There were 25 elective admissions, and 40 emergency admissions over half following appointments where no notable findings were recorded (Figure 2). Distance travelled to the ACHD clinic, which was supported by six clinical staff, was 14.9km (range 1.6-265) resulting in an estimated 433-564 workdays lost. During Covid 19, 56% appointments were in-person; 41% telephone; 5% video. Decisions were made at 37% in-person and 19% virtual consultations. Non-attendance was 3.9% and there were 8 emergency admissions. Conclusion The primary purpose of ACHD ambulatory care is surveillance. Despite this, emergency hospital admissions exceed elective hospital admissions. There is a high burden of care for patient and healthcare provider with the traditional outpatient model. The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated provision of ambulatory care in a different way and should encourage development of a new more patient-centred approach to ambulatory care delivery in ACHD.},

This study aimed to describe risk factors for COVID-19 death in three referral hospitals located at 3399 m in Cusco, Peru, during the first 14 months of the pandemic. A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. A random sample of ~50% (1225/2674) of adult hospitalized patients who died between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021 was identified. Of those, 977 individuals met the definition of death by COVID-19. Demographic characteristics, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive respiratory support (IRS), disease severity, comorbidities, and clinical manifestation at hospital admission were assessed as risk factors using Cox proportional-hazard models. In multivariable models adjusted by age, sex, and pandemic periods, critical disease (vs. moderate) was associated with a greater risk of death (aHR: 1.27; 95%CI: 1.14-1.142), whereas ICU admission (aHR: 0.39; 95%CI: 0.27-0.56), IRS (aHR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.26-0.54), the ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index >= 5.3 (aHR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.80-0.94), and the ratio of SatO2/FiO2 >= 122.6 (aHR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93-0.98) were associated with a lower risk of death. The risk factors described here may be useful in assisting decision making and resource allocation.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background. Procalcitonin (PCT) is often measured in patients with signs of bacterial infection. PCT is often elevated in bacterial pneumonia and septic shock and usually low in viral infections. Recent studies have found a correlation between PCT and disease severity in COVID-19, and most patients receive antibiotics despite bacterial co-infection being rare. We sought to characterize PCT trends in COVID-19, assess its relation to bacterial pneumonia, and assess its relation to clinical decision making around antimicrobial use. Methods. We included patients >=18 hospitalized at Michigan Medicine (3/1/20- 10/31/21), positive for COVID-19, with >= 1 PCT measurement. Structured query was used to retrospectively extract data. Patients started on an antibiotic underwent retrospective chart review by 2 reviewers for presence of bacterial pneumonia (bPNA), and were classified as having proven, probable, possible, or no bPNA (Figure 1). Multivariable models controlling for time from start of the pandemic, demographics, and comorbidities were used to determine associations of PCT and bPNA with antimicrobial use. Figure 1: Flow diagram of patients included in analyses Results. 793 patients met inclusion criteria, with 224 (28.2%) initiated on antibiotics. Of these 224, 33 (14.7%) had proven/probable bPNA, 125 (55.8%) had possible bPNA, and 66 (29.5%) had no bPNA. On average, patients had 2.6 +/-3.7 (mean +/-SD) PCT measurements, with 4.1 +/-5.2 if on antibiotics vs. 2.0 +/-2.6 if not. Initial PCT was higher in those on antibiotics and highest in those with proven/probable bPNA (Table 1). After adjustment for confounders, initial PCT was associated with antibiotic initiation (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.91, p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Initial PCT (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.20, p=0.008), change in PCT over time (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p=0.007), and bPNA category (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23-1.84, p < 0.0001) were associated with antibiotic duration (Table 3). Conclusion. PCT was elevated in patients with COVID-19, but more pronounced with bPNA. Antibiotics were started in > 25% of patients, regardless of bPNA. PCT trends associate with the decision to initiate antibiotics and treatment duration, independent of bPNA and comorbidities. Future prospective studies should determine if PCT can be used to safely make decisions around antibiotic treatment for bacterial infection during COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Background and Aims: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopy utilization, causing significant health and economic losses. We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature. Result(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected. Conclusion(s): PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy},

   abstract = {This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by using a panel fixed effects model for estimating the impact of government policy responses to the pandemic and their spillover effects on the consumer price index for West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries over the period January 2019-July 2020. Across various robustness checks, the OLS and IV regressions provide three major pieces of evidence. First, the COVID-19 confirmed cases positively affect the consumer price index while the overall government policy responses index has a negative impact on the consumer price index. Second, we find that government accommodative policies to COVID-19 in other countries has a positive and statistically significant impact on the host country's consumer price index. Finally, the findings indicate that world food prices and oil prices positively affect the consumer price index. These results suggest that policymakers may consider intensifying the implementation of public policies in response to the pandemic for preserving the stability of prices when the sanitary situation of the COVID-19 deteriorates. While confirming that international prices are among the key drivers of inflation in WAEMU countries, our findings also reiterate the importance of regional cooperation and coordination for fighting the adverse socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sleep is critical for physical and mental health; thus, understanding the factors that may contribute to poor sleep during the pandemic represents a first step in identifying behavioral health targets for intervention efforts during and after the pandemic. This review first summarizes the developing research on sleep during the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on sleep is then examined through the lens of the 3P model of insomnia by proposing pandemic-specific predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The potential consequences of sleep disturbance on physical and mental health conditions most relevant to the pandemic are also reviewed. Finally, recommendations for reducing or eliminating pandemic-specific perpetuating factors are detailed, highlighting the potential utility of behavioral sleep medicine interventions in the integration of behavioral health responses and public health initiatives during and after the pandemic.

   journal = {Clinical Trials},
   volume = {20},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   pages = {19-21},
   abstract = {Introduction: Efficient and comprehensive trial oversight and data management ensures valid, robust outcomes necessary to inform health policy and improve patient outcomes. This is particularly challenging in the context of multicenter trials. The format of this session will include four introductory presentations (15 min each), followed by 30-min panel discussion/Q&A focusing on recent experiences and innovative approaches utilized within the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program Research Base (WF NCORP RB). Since 2017, WF has managed 15 studies with approximately 3000 patient and 1000 provider/stakeholder accruals across 1000 potential participating community oncology practices within the United States and Puerto Rico. These practices often operate differently from academic medical centers, with varying patient capacity, provider number and level of engagement, use of advanced practice providers, and services offered. In addition, practices within this network have heterogeneous utility of electronic health records (EHRs) and display a wide range of clinical research staffing models. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for streamlining research visits and maximizing telehealth technologies when applicable, particularly for intervention non-therapeutic clinical trials. As such, research expectations must be standardized to ensure quality trial conduct and data collection across diverse practices. Recently, the WF NCORP RB has taken many steps to improve efficiency and data quality across our studies. This session will discuss a comprehensive approach to data quality and management across the lifespan of a trial. This starts with consent/ recruitment strategies and general oversight/ monitoring of our portfolio of trials. WF RB now utilizes REDCap for all data capture, as this allows direct data entry for site personnel and participant entered patient-reported outcomes using surveys. In addition, REDCap facilitates data monitoring, query, and auditing strategies. We will also introduce a team-based approach to adjudicate complex outcomes. Talk 1 (15 min): Specifically, Karen Craver, our RB administrator, will discuss approaches to obtain robust data as a result of strong screening and recruitment. She will provide an overview on how we survey practice research staff within the Landscape assessment and brief, pre-trial interest surveys to identify optimal target populations during the planning stage. We utilize our internal EHR to create custom screening reports to identify potential participants and generalize these for other practices to customize and use as a screening tool within their clinic. The RB has integrated remote consenting in part due to the pandemic, but we realize the need to continue offering flexibility in consent modality moving forward. Talk 2 (15 min): Emily Dressler, lead Biostatistician, will discuss oversight of the RB portfolio using dynamic reports within Tableau. These reports update daily and provide a comprehensive assessment of all ongoing and completed studies. RB personnel can filter reports to create custom results subset by timeframe, practice or set of practices, trial type, and/or other demographic characteristics. This has greatly reduced the request for study-specific accrual reports and has standardized our reporting across studies. She will also discuss the rationale for transitioning to REDCap, including strengths and weaknesses for integrating in multicenter studies. Talk 3 (15 min): Bill Stanfield, lead data manager, will demonstrate our utilization of the REDCap Data Resolution Workflow and Data Quality modules to efficiently manage data collection, data quality, and audits. He will show how REDCap can be used to seamlessly communicate with research staff to obtain missing or late data, verify out of range values, and then validate and lock responses for analysis. Talk 4 (15 min): Glenn Lesser, WF NCORP multiple principal investigator (mPI), will discuss a team approach to adjudicating cancer treatment information that often consists of combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy/targeted agents. This remains a particularly challenging problem in large trials enrolling patients with multiple types of cancer who may be treated with a wide spectrum of standard therapeutic regimens. This diversity limits both the effectiveness of automated reviews of remote data entries and the study-specific training of data management staff at sites. Data are pulled in real time from multiple forms within REDCap and collated into participant-level summaries of treatment, starting with the time of baseline assessment and sorted sequentially for each drug administration or event. A multidisciplinary team of data managers, biostatisticians, and clinicians meet to adjudicate each participant as data collection completes. Particularly for trials with multiple cancer types or treatment regimens, our experience with this approach has shown it identifies significant data gaps in treatment, with at least 75% of entries requiring clarification from research staff prior to finalizing and locking data. This process highlighted the challenge of real-time adjudication of treatment data in patients receiving multiple anti-cancer agents, given at varying doses and schedules, and in multiple combinations and/or phases over an individual patient's course of therapy. Panel (30 min): We will conclude with a panel discussion and Q&A. The panel will contribute additional perspective on implications of these strategies in the conduct of multilevel cancer care delivery research studies. We will also incorporate perspectives from NCORP community sites implementing these strategies. Panelists will discuss the broad applicability of these strategies for diverse trials, with attention to size/ complexity, database vendor, and patient population.},

   abstract = {While care models adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic with virtual and hybrid visits, clinical factors associated with treatment changes among ambulatory pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients are not well characterized. To understand which data critically altered treatment recommendations, we conducted a retrospective review among ambulatory children with Group 1 PAH to determine optimal visit and diagnostic strategies. Changes in management included: unplanned new treatments, dose modifications of vasodilators or diuretics, unscheduled hospitalizations, or changes to activity recommendations, catheterization schedule, or other testing. Factors prompting management changes were classified as symptoms, exam findings, or diagnostic tests. Across 398 ambulatory visits by 48 patients, 38 patients (79%) at 88 visits (22%) required change in management, most commonly in targeted PH medication. Changes were driven by symptoms alone (15%), diagnostic testing alone (47%), exam only (2%), symptoms and exam (2%), combination of testing and symptoms or testing and exam (25%), and other reasons (9%). Patients with World Health Organization functional Class IV (odds ratio [OR] 9.04 vs. Class I, p = 0.014) or Class III (OR 2.08 vs. Class I, p = 0.050) were more likely to undergo change in management. However, among Class I patients, 18% of visits generated changes in management because of test findings. While multiple factors affect management in ambulatory pediatric PH, neither symptoms nor exam was sufficient for identifying patients warranting clinical change in management. Testing accounted for most changes. Thus, in-person or hybrid surveillance including history, exam, and diagnostic testing remains essential for optimal management of pediatric PAH.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   volume = {48},

   pages = {e257},
   abstract = {Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic caused many changes in our clinic, including variable patient volume, a shift towards hypofractionation, and changes in on-site staff availability. This work sought to retrospectively evaluate incident learning data before and after our state declared a public health emergency due to COVID-19. Method(s): Our clinic has been operating an electronic incident reporting system since January 2017. All staff members can voluntarily report patient safety incidents and other clinical issues. The reports submitted during the six months pre- and post-March 13th, 2020, were reviewed and analyzed for trends that could be associated with clinical changes due to COVID-19. The reports (n=475) were categorized with respect to event classification (incident, near miss, etc.), whether a dosimetric change was required, anatomical site, the process step where incidents occurred and were discovered, the role of the reporter, and the type of intervention. Within each category, the number and distribution of reports before and during COVID-19 were compared to identify changes over time. Result(s): The overall number of reports decreased by 19% (262 to 213) in the 6 months following March 13th. The event classifications that had the greatest decrease were ?near miss? (-36%) and ?operational/process improvement? (-19%). Of all team members, incident reporting by physicists remained the closest to baseline (-7%). While the overall number of reports submitted decreased, the number that involved a plan revision increased by 18%. The proportion of reports addressed with a quality improvement intervention increased during COVID-19 from 45% to 63%. In direct response to the pandemic, a change in the operational model for physician coverage was implemented. Conclusion(s): Patterns of incident reporting changed during COVID-19, with fewer reports being submitted for low-severity issues. This change may be attributable to staff effort being redirected to respond to COVID-19-associated clinical changes.},

   journal = {American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine},

   abstract = {RATIONALE. Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has yielded a pandemic that has threatened our health, and depleted resources. The resulting mass casualties made obvious the need for early decision making in distribution of critical care resources. Given the strong association of hospital overoccupancy and all-cause mortality, clinicians need a dedicated tool to streamline triage/resource allocation and reduce clinical deliberation time.METHODS. A retrospective chart review of nonhospice admissions (n=26,249) for COVID-19 positive adult patients admitted between March 2020-April 2021 was conducted. Biomarker profiles and clinical phenotype collected as part of their standard of care (n=63 variables) was analyzed using random forests for variable selection via a novel modified hamming distance between variable importance rankings of models with identical hyperparameters. We applied a novel analysis pipeline to COVID-19 patients (n=6,606) admitted to NYU Langone Health March 2020-April 2020 with respect to ICU admission and-independently- mortality to discover the most important variables (n=15 per outcome) and used gradient-boosted decision trees to build predictive models of ICU admission and mortality based on these variables. Models were validated prospectively on patients (n=19,643) admitted after the 1st wave (May 2020- April 2021). All data was collected in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 11 and approved by the NYU IRB#20-00473.RESULTS. The classifier of ICU admission had 5-fold cross-validated AUCROC = 0.85 on training data, and the most important variables in predicting this endpoint included procalcitonin, respiratory rate, and lactate. The classifier of mortality had 5-fold cross-validated AUCROC = 0.87 on training data, and the most important variables included age, blood urea nitrogen, and troponin. We then validated these models prospectively on the next year of data and visualized model performance over time. Additionally, we analyzed how risk of individual predictors varied longitudinally as disease presentation and standard of care evolved.CONCLUSION. Our study leverages a NYC cohort of well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients from the primary surge and subsequent year. We have presented evidence that novel biomarkers and their combinations may be important in assessment and triage of COVID-19. Finally, we have analyzed how our predictors and overall model have evolved over the course of the pandemic and found that the performance of some plateaued while others rose or declined.},

   abstract = {Emerging epidemics and local infection clusters are initially prone to stochastic effects that can substantially impact the early epidemic trajectory. While numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results on the size of the epidemic over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that the initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by stochasticity. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha detected in September 2020 first appeared in the UK early August 2020. We also compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a given threshold size. These results improve our theoretical understanding of early epidemics and will be useful for the study and control of local infectious disease clusters.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The lack of mass testing for COVID-19 diagnosis creates the need to determine the magnitude of the disease based on its clinical symptoms. The study aimed to analyze the profile of COVID-19 symptoms and related aspects in Brazil. The author analyzed the sample of participants from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-COVID19) conducted in May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed with sociodemographic covariables and 11 symptoms reported by 346,181 individuals. Rao-Scott test and standardized residual analysis were used to measure the association with the pattern of health services use. Spatial scan analysis was performed to identify areas at risk of COVID-19 cases. LCA showed six classes of symptoms based on the pattern of answers by participants: (1) all the symptoms; (2) high prevalence of symptoms; (3) predominance of fever; (4) predominance of cough/sore throat; (5) mild symptoms with predominance of headache; and (6) absence of symptoms. Female sex, brown skin color, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and all three older age brackets showed stronger association with the class with all the symptoms (class 1). Most use of health services was also by this group of individuals, but with different profiles of use. Spatial analysis showed juxtaposition of this class with areas at greater risk of COVID-19. These finding underline the importance of investigating symptoms for the epidemiological identification of possible cases in a scenario with low population testing rates.Copyright © 2021 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

   abstract = {Background: Social media has become ubiquitous in modern medicine. Academic neurosurgery has increased adoption to promote individual and departmental accomplishments, engage with patients, and foster collaboration. We sought to quantitatively evaluate the adoption of one of the most used social media platforms, Twitter, within academic neurosurgery. Method(s): A quantitative and qualitative analysis of Twitter use across 118 academic neurosurgery departments with residency programs in the United States was performed in March 2019 and March 2021. We collated Twitter handles, Doximity residency ranking (a peer-determined ranking system), geographic location, and Twitter demographics (tweets, followers, likes, and tweet content) from before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Tweet content was characterized by reviewers over a predetermined 6-month period. Linear regression and parametric/nonparametric tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Departmental accounts grew 3.7 accounts per year between 2009 and 2019 (R2 = 0.96), but 43 accounts (130%) were added between 2019 (n = 33) and 2021 (n = 76). This growth, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, changed the model from linear to exponential growth (R2 = 0.97). The highest-ranking programs based on Doximity were significantly more likely to have an account (P < 0.001) and have more followers (P < 0.0001). Tweet content analysis revealed prioritization of faculty/resident activity (mean 49.9%) throughout the quartiles. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate rapid uptake in Twitter use among U.S. academic neurosurgical departments, accelerated by COVID-19. With the impact of COVID-19, it is clear that there will be continued rapid adoption of this platform within neurosurgery, and future studies should explore the outcomes of peer collaboration, patient engagement, and dissemination of medical information.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   journal = {Women and Birth},
   volume = {36},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   pages = {S14},
   abstract = {Background: How the model of maternity care impacted women's experience and perinatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic is not well known. There is some evidence that birth at home and midwifery continuity of care models were viewed positively by women giving birth during the pandemic, but it is less certain as to whether birth outcomes were impacted. Research has shown the model of maternity care can impact on perinatal outcomes and women's experiences. In Australia, there are around 10 different models of care that fall into 5 categories: standard care (SC) which is public and fragmented in nature; general practitioner (GP) public hospital shared care; midwifery continuity of care (MWCOC) in the public system; private obstetric (PO) care in the private system and private practising midwifery (PPM) care 1. Aim(s): The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the five main models of maternity care on the labour, birth and postpartum outcomes of women who gave birth in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic Design: The Birth in the Time of COVID (BITTOC) project is a mixed-method, longitudinal study investigating the pandemic-related experiences and mental health of women who were pregnant or have given birth during the pandemic. Using nationally distributed surveys the BITTOC study was conducted in Australia from March to December 2020 (BITTOC 2020), and again from August 2021 to March 2022 (BITTOC 2021). Participant(s): A total of 6154 women responded to the surveys and of these 3725 women were postnatal and could provide information on birth outcomes and therefore were included in this study. Analysis: Sample weighting was used, and a multivariable model with three series of logistic regression models was performed. The first stage (model 1) adjusted for the survey year, model of care and demographic factors. The second stage (model 2) included model 1, plus obstetric factors. The third stage (model 3) included model 2 and mental health risk factors. This type of structured logistic regression model allowed us to examine birth outcomes depending on the model of care received by women during and after childbirth. Result(s): Compared with standard fragmented care (SC), continuity care with a midwife employed in public health (MWCOC) and under a privately practising midwife (PPM) led to higher: spontaneous labour, spontaneous vaginal birth, postnatal visits at home by a midwife, feeling supported postnatally, feeling the care provider showed commitment and feeling the care provider knew them. MWCOC and PPM care led to lower: induction, elective and emergency caesarean births, augmentation with oxytocin, fetal distress, admission of a baby to SCN/NICU, Jaundice (only for PPMs), baby being given formula when chosen to breastfeed (only for PPMs), rates of birth trauma. Compared with SC, care under a private obstetrician (PO) led to higher: elective caesarean section and feeling the care provider showed commitment and feeling the care provider knew them. Care under a PO led to lower: spontaneous labour, spontaneous vaginal birth, postpartum haemorrhage, baby going to SCN/NICU, midwife visiting at home postnatally and birth trauma. Conclusion(s): Compared to SC, the best perinatal outcomes for women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic were achieved for women accessing midwifery models of care, particularly when cared for by PPMs. Perinatal outcomes for GP-shared care differed little from SC.Copyright © 2023},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a large number of people suffering from emotional problems. However, the mechanisms by which intolerance of uncertainty (IU) affects negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of pandemic-focused time and the moderating role of perceived efficacy in the association between IU and negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the uncertainty-time-efficacy-emotion model (UTEE). 1131 participants were recruited to complete measures of COVID-19 IU, pandemic-focused time, perceived efficacy, negative emotions and de-mographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 IU was significantly and positively associated with negative emotions, and this link could be mediated by pandemic-focused time. Moreover, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was moderated by perceived efficacy. Specifically, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was much stronger for individuals with lower levels of perceived efficacy. The current study further extended the previous integrative uncertainty tolerance model. Furthermore, the study suggested that policy makers and mental health professionals should reduce the general public's negative emotions during the pandemic through effective interventions such as adjusting COVID-19 IU, shortening pandemic-focused time and enhancing perceived efficacy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   volume = {3},

   pages = {225-236},
   abstract = {The USA is the leading emitter of greenhouse gases among the developed countries, in part because it is the only developed country with more of its population in suburbs than in cities. Cities produce less greenhouse gas emissions per capita than suburbs. Meanwhile, the US and the world have been wrestling with the public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. But as US cities recover from the pandemic, they are unlikely to add more population than their suburbs because of changes in favor of working from home, online shopping, and the search for more affordable housing and green space, as well as concerns about population density and contagious diseases. So, the challenge is how to design and redevelop suburbs to make them more environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable to address both climate change and the threat of future pandemics. A sustainable suburb scenario offers an alternative to the sprawling development, separation of land uses and income classes, and automobile dependence that characterizes the typical American suburban landscape. This essay reviews the literature on re-designing suburbs and describes and evaluates both a business-as-usual suburb scenario and a sustainable suburb scenario. Though challenges exist, sustainable suburbs will be needed in order to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions, to achieve greater resilience in adapting to the effects of climate change, and to guard against future pandemics while providing economic opportunities and greater equity over the long run.

   abstract = {Background: In recent times, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are posing a public health threat in developing countries, and vigilant surveillance is necessary to prepare against these threats. Analyses of multi-year comprehensive infectious disease syndrome data are required in Mongolia, but have not been conducted till date. This study aimed to describe the trends in the incidence of infectious disease syndromes in Mongolia during 2009-2017 using a nationwide syndrome surveillance system for infectious diseases established in 2009. Method(s): We analyzed time trends using monthly data on the incidence of infectious disease syndromes such as acute fever with rash (AFR), acute fever with vesicular rash (AFVR), acute jaundice (AJ), acute watery diarrhea (AWD), acute bloody diarrhea (ABD), foodborne disease (FD) and nosocomial infection (NI) reported from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2017. Time series forecasting models based on the data up to 2017 estimated the future trends in the incidence of syndromes up to December 2020. Result(s): During the study, the overall prevalence of infectious disease syndromes was 71.8/10,000 population nationwide. The average number of reported infectious disease syndromes was 14,519 (5229-55,132) per year. The major types were AFR (38.7%), AFVR (31.7%), AJ (13.9%), ABD (10.2%), and AWD (1.8%), accounting for 96.4% of all reported syndromes. The most prevalent syndromes were AJ between 2009 and 2012 (59.5-48.7%), AFVR between 2013 and 2014 (54.5-59%), AFR between 2015 and 2016 (67.6-65.9%), and AFVR in 2017 (62.2%). There were increases in the prevalence of AFR, with the monthly number of cases being 37.7 +/- 6.1 during 2015-2016; this could be related to the measles outbreak in Mongolia during that period. The AFVR incidence rate showed winter's multiplicative seasonal fluctuations with a peak of 10.6 +/- 2 cases per 10,000 population in 2017. AJ outbreaks were identified in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and these could be associated with hepatitis A outbreaks. Prospective time series forecasting showed increasing trends in the rates of AFVR and ABD. Conclusion(s): The evidence-based method for infectious disease syndromes was useful in gaining an understanding of the current situation, and predicting the future trends of various infectious diseases in Mongolia.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

   journal = {Journal of advanced nursing},
   abstract = {AIM: To develop a framework for understanding the stress appraisal process among acute care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of open-ended responses from a cross-sectional survey of 3030 frontline, acute care nurses in New Jersey and the effect of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping guided the study. Thematic analysis was used to analyse 1607 open-ended responses. RESULT(S): Nine themes emerged during the secondary appraisal of stress. Five themes contributed to distress and burnout including (1) high patient acuity with scarce resources, (2) constantly changing policies with inconsistent messaging, (3) insufficient PPE, (4) unprepared pandemic planning and (5) feeling undervalued. Four themes led to eustress and contributed to post-traumatic growth including (1) team nursing to ensure sufficient resource allocation, (2) open channels of communication, (3) sense- of-duty and (4) personal strength from new possibilities. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic was a traumatic event for patients and the nursing workforce. Internal and external demands placed on acute care nurses increased burnout, however, a subset of nurses with adequate support experienced personal growth. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: Beyond mental health interventions for acute care nurses, organizational interventions such as reevaluation of emergency action plans to optimize resource allocation, and work environment strategies such as improved communication and decision-making transparency are necessary. IMPACT: To better understand how frontline acute care nurses experienced stress during COVID-19, a data-informed framework was developed that included a primary and secondary appraisal of stress. Themes contributing to distress and burnout were identified, and themes leading to eustress and post-traumatic growth were also identified. These findings can assist nurse leaders in optimizing strategies to reduce burnout and promote post-traumatic growth in the post-COVID years. REPORTING METHOD: No patient or public contribution.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Journal of Advanced Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   journal = {European Journal of Neurology},
   volume = {28},

   pages = {473},
   abstract = {Background and aims: Until the 1st week of January / 2021, Brazil is the 3rd country with the highest number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID- 19). Annually, neurological diseases and their complications culminate in approximately 200,000 hospitalisations in the Brazilian public health system. This work intends to investigate the relation between COVID-19 and its effect on the condition of neurological patients. Method(s): The research used the descriptors: Coronavirus Infections, Brazil, Nervous System Diseases; in PubMed, Scielo and Virtual Health Library databases. Through DataSUS, epidemiological data was collected about: Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Epilepsy. Result(s): It was expected an increase in urgent hospitalisations related to the neurological diseases scanned. According to studies carried out in other countries, the exacerbation of neurological symptoms is possible. Contrariwise, there was a significant reduction in hospitalizations related to these diseases (DataSUS), especially between April and October 2020, when the number of COVID-19 cases increased dramatically in Brazil. The cause of reduction in hospitalisations may come from a scenario of systematic underreporting triggered by the pandemic. Hospitalisation due to coronavirus infection, in the Brazilian context, allows complications of pre-existing neurological diseases, resulting from COVID-19, to not be properly registered and notified in the integrated system. Conclusion(s): Brazil, due to its integrated health system, is able to provide full data collected from all its territory. Had there not been a noticeable reduction in hospital care due to fear of infection, this would enable further research and understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on pre-existing neurological conditions.

This is a qualitative study of documental review that seeks to understand how the regulations and official instructive ma-nuals have been shaping the way NASF teams operate. It proposes to divide the NASF construction process into five periods: previous move-ments (2003 to 2007); support guidelines (2008 to 2011); the universalization of nasf (2012 to 2015); expansion of support (2016 to 2018); and the dismantling of NASF? (2019 to 2021). The results show changes in guidelines over the years of the team's existence, especially in relation to the matrix support concept and its two dimensions: technical-pedagogical and clinical care. This study also demonstrates the effects of the Previne Brasil Program on the NASF, which resulted in the reduction of 379 teams in 2020 and 2021. Ad-ded to this scenario is the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which may be repositioning NASF interventions in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS, in Portuguese).Copyright © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

   title = {Using GAM functions and Markov-Switching models in an evaluation framework to assess countries' performance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic},
   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {21},
   number = {1},
   pages = {2173},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated several initiatives to better understand its behavior, and some projects are monitoring its evolution across countries, which naturally leads to comparisons made by those using the data. However, most "at a glance" comparisons may be misleading because the curve that should explain the evolution of COVID-19 is different across countries, as a result of the underlying geopolitical or socio-economic characteristics. Therefore, this paper contributes to the scientific endeavour by creating a new evaluation framework to help stakeholders adequately monitor and assess the evolution of COVID-19 in countries, considering the occurrence of spikes, "secondary waves" and structural breaks in the time series. METHOD(S): Generalized Additive Models were used to model cumulative and daily curves for confirmed cases and deaths. The Root Relative Squared Error and the Percentage Deviance Explained measured how well the models fit the data. A local min-max function was used to identify all local maxima in the fitted values. The pure Markov-Switching and the family of Markov-Switching GARCH models were used to identify structural breaks in the COVID-19 time series. Finally, a quadrants system to identify countries that are more/less efficient in the short/long term in controlling the spread of the virus and the number of deaths was developed. Such methods were applied in the time series of 189 countries, collected from the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. RESULT(S): Our methodology proves more effective in explaining the evolution of COVID-19 than growth functions worldwide, in addition to standardizing the entire estimation process in a single type of function. Besides, it highlights several inflection points and regime-switching moments, as a consequence of people's diminished commitment to fighting the pandemic. Although Europe is the most developed continent in the world, it is home to most countries with an upward trend and considered inefficient, for confirmed cases and deaths. CONCLUSION(S): The new outcomes presented in this research will allow key stakeholders to check whether or not public policies and interventions in the fight against COVID-19 are having an effect, easily identifying examples of best practices and promote such policies more widely around the world.Copyright © 2021.

This study aimed to determine the factors associated with deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Maranhao, in northeastern Brazil. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional and analytical study with patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who died from March 2020 to January 2022. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between clinical-epidemiological characteristics and death. The odds ratios were expressed using a 95% confidence interval and a 5% significance level. Result(s): A total of 386,567 cases of COVID-19 were registered in the period, of which 10,986 died. Risk factors associated with deaths from COVID-19 were male sex, age over 30 years, positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result, positive CT scan, and having one or more associated comorbidities. The three comorbidities linked to the highest propensity to die were diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, and obesity. Conclusion(s): The study findings support the implementation of strategic actions by health care and surveillance professionals and managers towards reducing the incidence of the risk factors for mortality by COVID-19 in Maranhao.Copyright © 2023 Alves de Oliveira et al.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has thus far restricted the large movement of people; nonetheless, we cannot exclude the disruptive power of a virus with similar characteristics to COVID-19 affecting both high-and low-income countries, as a factor for future mass migrations. Indeed, the top 15 countries affected by COVID-19 host about 9 million refugees, and it is, therefore, important to investigate and strengthen the readiness of countries' health policies to ensure they are well equipped to deal with potential large influxes of 'epidemic-related refugees and migrants.' Using the Bardach Policy Framework as a tool for analysis, this article investigates the readiness of countries for a potential public health event (mass migration generated by future pandemics), therefore, aiming at a health response forecasting exercise. The article reviews the policies put in place by countries who faced large influxes of migrants between 2011 and 2015 (the policy-prolific years between the Arab Spring migration and the introduction of stringent measures in Europe) and new evidence generated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including the 'ECDC Guidance on infection prevention and control of COVID-19 in migrant and refugee reception and detention centres in the EU/EEA and the UK' and the 'WHO Lancet priority for dealing with migration and COVID-19' ) to formulate a policy option able to strengthen national system capacities for responding to influxes of epidemic-related migrants and the management of highly infectious diseases.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and affected millions of individuals as of the efficient virus transmission potential mediated via multiple virus shedding routes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool samples and its prolonged shedding in environmental compartments like sewage and wastewater signifies a potential threat adding to the transmission cycle of this novel virus. The potential role played by the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in transmitting the disease via the fecal-oral route is now under investigation. Hence, in the present scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology, and sewage surveillance may provide valuable insights into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the human population and could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and a crucial early warning tool. Further studies are required to determine the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, transmissibility through wastewater, and the potential to infect humans via the fecal-oral route. Appropriate frameworks with regards to evaluation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 will help implement appropriate intervention strategies and necessary sanitation practices to ensure virus free clean water supply to have a check on the further spread of this pandemic virus.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, health authorities have released epidemiologic data about this disease. These data were the most important sources of information which were periodically updated and analyzed by researchers to predict the spread of the epidemic. However, comprehensive and timely data on the evolution of COVID-19 have not always been made available to researchers and physicians., Method: The aim of our work is to investigate quality, availability and format of epidemiologic data about COVID-19 in Italy in different territorial and temporal areas. We tried to access the online resources made available by each of the 19 Italian Regions and the two autonomous Provinces, and in more detail by the Local Health Authorities of one of them, the Emilia-Romagna Region. We analyzed the main sources and flows of data (namely new and cumulative cases of infection, total swabs, new and cumulative COVID-19 deaths, overall and divided by sex), describing their characteristics such as accessibility, format and completeness. We eventually reviewed the data published by the Italian Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Health (ISS) and the Civil Protection Department. The Tim Berners-Lee scale was used to evaluate the open data format., Results: The flow of COVID-19 epidemiologic data in Italy originated from the Local Health Authorities that transmitted the data - on a daily basis - to the regional authorities, which in turn transferred them to the national authorities. We found a rather high heterogeneity in both the content and the format of the released data, both at the local and the regional level. Few Regions were releasing data in open format. ISS was the only national source of data that provided the number of COVID-19 health outcomes divided by sex and age groups since Spring 2020., Conclusions: Despite multiple potential useful sources for COVID-19 epidemiology are present in Italy, very few open format data were available both at a macro geographical level (e.g. per Region) and at the provincial level. The access to open format epidemiologic data should be eased, to allow researchers to adequately assess future epidemics and therefore favor timely and effective public health interventions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to provide a description of inequalities in overall and COVID-19 mortality by ecological socioeconomic measures (ESEMs) during the first outbreak peak (March and April 2020) in Emilia-Romagna Region. DESIGN: cross-sectional study based on the record linkage of the COVID-19 notification system, the regional population health register and the 2011 census data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: residents in Emilia-Romag-na who were grouped according to three ESEMs calculated at census block level: the index of deprivation, the household crowding, and the percentage of the foreign resident popu-lation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. RESULT(S): during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COV-ID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COV-ID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COV-ID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gra-dients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSION(S): these descriptive yet informative results are relevant to document inequalities and inform regional public health policies and interventions in case of new COVID-19 surges.Copyright © 2020, Inferenze Scarl.

   abstract = {Italy was the first European country to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. To limit the transmission of the virus, the Italian Government imposed strict domestic quarantine policies and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools from March 10th,2020. Although more and more literature is exploring the impact of the pandemic on non-referred children and families, only a few studies are focused on the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 in chronically ill children and their caregivers. The present study investigates asthma control and children and mothers' psychological functioning (i.e.: psychological well-being, fear of contagion, and mothers' Covid-19 related fears) in 45 asthmatic children aged 7-to-14, compared to a control sample. The subjects were administered an online survey after the lockdown (from 28th May to 23rd August 2020). The analysis shows that asthmatic children presented higher concern in relation to contagion, however, no difference in psychological functioning was displayed between the two cohorts. Mothers reported more Covid-19 related fears, and greater worries according to the resumption of their children's activities. Moreover, they indicated a global worsening of their psychological well-being during the lockdown. Furthermore, regarding the clinical sample, the multivariate regression model showed that a worsening of mothers' psychological and children's physical well-being was associated with a worsening of children's psychological well-being during the lockdown. The results of this study indicate that mothers of asthmatic children can be more prone to experience psychological fatigue in a pandemic scenario. Special programs should be developed to support caregivers of chronically ill children.},

   abstract = {Objective. Describe the perceptions of key actors regarding the disruption of health services for populations that ceased to be prioritized because of the COVID-19 pandemic-pregnant women, newborn, children, adolescents, and women-in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) during the first stage of the pandemic. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, a 35-question survey was administered to key actors in 19 LAC countries between July and September 2020. The respondents were asked for their personal perceptions regarding the situation of social and health services in their country before and during the pandemic. They were also asked for a projection of the situation during the post-pandemic period. Results. In the 691 responses received, the main perception was that coverage in the services analyzed had been high before the pandemic, although their quality was not as highly rated. Both the coverage and quality of services were thought to have declined for adolescents and women. The majority of respondents predicted that all services will continue to function at lower than usual coverage levels for another three months (53.1%) and another 12 months (41.3%). Guaranteeing coverage and access to health services was considered the main policy challenge going forward. The next most needed initiatives noted were financing for actions to support women, children, and adolescents, and protection against violence and promotion of measures to combat it. Conclusions. Although the pandemic has struck all countries, its effect on the delivery of services in the populations analyzed differs from country to country and according to the types of service. It is essential to invest in national information systems that will make it possible to monitor the different services and identify the populations that need to be prioritized.Copyright © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {21},
   number = {1},
   pages = {2139},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only previous studies that formulated a theoretical model of epidemics for psychological response relative to cultural perspectives have focused on the role of individualism-collectivism and have omitted analysis of tightness-looseness. This study explored the role of cultural tightness in relation to psychological disorders during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): We recruited 1827 Chinese adolescents (Mage =18.16+/-2.23years, 53.3% female) to participate a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including the scales of cultural tightness, risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic, perceived protection efficacy, anxiety and depression. A latent moderated structural equations model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects of risk perception regarding COVID-19, cultural tightness and perceived protection efficacy on psychological disorders. RESULT(S): The results showed that greater risk perception of COVID-19 predicted greater psychological disorders, however cultural tightness moderated this positive relationship. The increase in psychological disorders with risk perception regarding COVID-19 was less pronounced among people who lived in tighter cultural areas. In addition, this moderating effect of cultural tightness was further mediated by perceived protection efficacy; that is, tight culture protects against psychological disorders by enhancing perceived protection efficacy. CONCLUSION(S): This study enriched the theoretical framework of cultural tightness and indicated its importance in the field of mental health and health policies. It also emphasized the importance of tight culture as a protective factor against psychological disorders in case of COVID-19 outbreaks, providing valuable practical insight into psychological prevention for COVID-19 outbreaks.Copyright © 2021.

   abstract = {Broke out at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has been spreading throughout the world, leading to more than 87 million confirmed infections and 1.88 million fatalities. Motivated by this, we evaluate the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on both national and industrial levels by employing quarterly computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Our results reveal that the epidemic may lower China's economic growth in 2020 by 3.5%, versus 4.4% for final consumption (relative to baseline). The service industry suffers the most from the outbreak, and the Accommodation-Food-Beverage service, Wholesale-Retail Trade, and Transport-Storage-Post are identified as the most vulnerable sectors, with the negative impact on output reaching as high as 14.6%. When moving to 2021, the hit to economy shrinks to 2% (1.2-2.7%), with industry estimated to be the most affected sector instead. This study indicates that implementing effective measures for preventing and controlling the epidemic and policies for post-disease economic recovery play critical role in curbing the potential economic damage.

   abstract = {Background: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in acute-care settings affects patients, healthcare workers, and the healthcare system. We conducted an analysis of risk factors associated with outbreak severity to inform prevention strategies. Method(s): This cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 outbreaks was conducted at Fraser Health acute-care sites between March 2020 and March 2021. Outbreak severity measures included COVID-19 attack rate, outbreak duration, and 30-day case mortality. Generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations were used for all outcome measures. A P value of 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Analyses were performed using SAS version 3.8 software, R version 4.1.0 software, and Stata version 16.0 software. Result(s): Between March 2020 and March 2021, 54 COVID-19 outbreaks were declared in Fraser Health acute-care sites. Overall, a 10% increase in the hand hygiene rate during the outbreak resulted in an 18% decrease in the attack rate (P <.01), 1 fewer death (P =.03), and shorter outbreaks (P <.01). A 10-year increase in unit age was associated with 2.2 additional days of outbreak (P < 0.01) and increases in the attack rate (P <.05) and the number of deaths (P <.01). Discussion(s): We observed an inverse relationship between increased hand hygiene compliance during outbreaks and all 3 severity measures. Increased unit age was also associated with increases in each of the severity measures. Conclusion(s): This study highlights the importance of hand hygiene practices during an outbreak and the difficulties faced by older facilities, many of which have infrastructural challenges. The latter reinforces the need to incorporate infection control standards into healthcare planning and construction.Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

   abstract = {Purpose: Our prior research shows that experiencing bullying (including racist incidents) during the pandemic is associated with poor COVID-19- related outcomes. While racism is clearly recognized as a public health issue, its measurement and associations as an exposure during the pandemic are not fully clear. We aim to understand associations of social determinants of health (SDOH) with perpetration of a specific expression of racism - unprompted anti-Chinese sentiment (UACS) - as a potential COVID-19-related exposure. Method(s): We used a mixed methods analytic strategy to identify associations of SDOH with UACS, nested within a larger cross-sectional global COVID-19 attitudes and practices study. Two analysts classified Chinarelated terms from the study's qualitative questions as "Positive/Neutral" or "Negative", iteratively reaching concurrence. We tested SDOH measuring sociocultural, environmental, healthcare, and biological constructs against UACS, creating a parsimonious final model. Result(s): Overall, 7,411 people from 173 countries participated in the parent study. In total, 146 people (2.0%) expressed UACS. Predictive models of association with UACS (Table 1) showed older age, less education, residence in Oceania, low perception of social support from friends, weaker belief that community institutions effectively confronted COVID-19, and self-reported COVID-19 infection were significantly more likely to mention UACS. Conclusion(s): UACS - representing top-of-mind racist sentiments - were associated with selected demographics, personal COVID-experience and attitudes, social support, and geography. Better understanding UACS could help address dismantling racism through targeted awareness and communications. Understanding and addressing the public health impact of (and perpetration of) racism begins with measurement, and is specific to marginalized communities.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {To support the ongoing management of viral respiratory diseases while transitioning out of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries are moving toward an integrated model of surveillance for SARSCoV-2, influenza virus, and other respiratory pathogens. Although many surveillance approaches catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic provide novel epidemiologic insight, continuing them as implemented during the pandemic is unlikely to be feasible for nonemergency surveillance, and many have already been scaled back. Furthermore, given anticipated cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, surveillance activities in place before the pandemic require review and adjustment to ensure their ongoing value for public health. In this report, we highlight key challenges for the development of integrated models of surveillance. We discuss the relative strengths and limitations of different surveillance practices and studies as well as their contribution to epidemiologic assessment, forecasting, and public health decision-making.Copyright © 2024 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The UK government relied, in part, on the CovidSim model to guide its policy to contain the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during March and April 2020; however, CovidSim contains several sources of uncertainty that affect the quality of its predictions: parametric uncertainty, model structure uncertainty and scenario uncertainty. Here we report on parametric sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of the code. From the 940 parameters used as input into CovidSim, we find a subset of 19 to which the code output is most sensitive-imperfect knowledge of these inputs is magnified in the outputs by up to 300%. The model displays substantial bias with respect to observed data, failing to describe validation data well. Quantifying parametric input uncertainty is therefore not sufficient: the effect of model structure and scenario uncertainty must also be properly understood. Copyright © 2021.

Among the putative links between hypertension and COVID-19 is a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 facilitates entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, into host cells. Because RAS inhibitors have been suggested to increase ACE2 expression, health-care providers and patients have grappled with the decision of whether to discontinue these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experimental models of analogous viral pneumonias suggest RAS inhibitors may exert protective effects against acute lung injury. We review how RAS and ACE2 biology may affect outcomes in COVID-19 through pulmonary and other systemic effects. In addition, we briefly detail the data for and against continuation of RAS inhibitors in persons with COVID-19 and summarize the current consensus recommendations from select specialty organizations.Copyright © 2020 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

   abstract = {Most cities in developing countries suffer environmental degradation caused by the growth of unplanned areas that sprawl in the cities. In the current paper, we attempted to integrate a set of selected UN-based urban indicators based on the New Urban Agenda (NUA) within a GIS framework to observe and assess some aspects of urban vulnerability among city districts based on deprivation. The vulnerability map for the districts in Assiut City was created through a spatial multicriteria evaluation model. Thirteen sub-indicators related to shelter, social environmental and economic situations have been assessed in the model using standardization, weighting and aggregation methods. Results revealed that: districts, namely, El Thaltha, El Owla, El Thania, and El Rabaa are most vulnerable in most scenarios, while districts, namely, El Sheyakha El Sabaa, and El Sadsa, El-Walidya El Qiblia and El-Hamra El Thania are among the least vulnerable zones. Results also revealed that vulnerable districts encompass the highest percentage of slums, highest density of population, highest rates for urban growth and poor connection to services. Eventually, we assume that the most vulnerable zones in the city are under the highest risk of airborne diseases including COVID-19 epidemic. Eventually, a subset of selected urban vulnerability indicators that could be triggering the spread of the pandemic was chosen for another spatial multcriteria model to delineate city zones under risk. The result revealed that expected high-risk areas exist in the south-west of the city and include El Thaltha, El Owla, El Thania and El Rabaa districts, while the least risk district is El-Walydia El-Qeblia. The applied methodology and its outputs could support decision makers in reviewing priorities, setting contingency plans, allocation of funds and raising resilience among the city districts.

   abstract = {During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sudan, women took the heaviest burden in taking care of family health needs. Potential health risks and its ensuing readiness to adopt and comply with public health measures may be especially distressing on women. Mental health challenges involved with modifying health behaviours that adhere to pandemic guidelines are considered following the Stages of Change Model. A total of 498 Sudanese women completed a cross-sectional online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Khartoum State. A questionnaire was designed to assess the transition within the stages of change towards maintenance to protective behaviours. Mental health status was assessed using an Arabic validated version of the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist for depression and anxiety. Most of the respondents were 40-year university graduate women. Depression and anxiety were low among 75% of respondents. The stages of change indicated that 22% of the women are in the maintenance stage compared to 1% in precontemplation. Anxiety increased significantly with the progression in the stages. The multiple regression equation R2 = .42, F(1, 416) = 6.71, p = .005 indicated that the preparation stage and action stage has a significant effect on the maintenance of protective behaviours. The most likely factors to motivate Sudanese women to comply with COVID-19 protective behaviours are the perception of self-efficacy coupled with access to information. The implications may be central to empirically stage-match transition points in the change process as they relate to mental health status. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical patients with limited digital literacy may experience reduced telemedicine access. We investigated racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in telemedicine compared with in-person surgical consultation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of new visits within the Division of General & Gastrointestinal Surgery at an academic medical center occurring between March 24 through June 23, 2020 (Phase I, Massachusetts Public Health Emergency) and June 24 through December 31, 2020 (Phase II, relaxation of restrictions on healthcare operations) was performed. Visit modality (telemedicine/phone vs in-person) and demographic data were extracted. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and visit modality. RESULT(S): During Phase I, 347 in-person and 638 virtual visits were completed. Multivariable modeling demonstrated no significant differences in virtual compared with in-person visit use across racial/ethnic or insurance groups. Among patients using virtual visits, Latinx patients were less likely to have video compared with audio-only visits than White patients (OR, 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.96). Black race and insurance type were not significant predictors of video use. During Phase II, 2,922 in-person and 1,001 virtual visits were completed. Multivariable modeling demonstrated that Black patients (OR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.12-2.06) were more likely to have virtual visits than White patients. No significant differences were observed across insurance types. Among patients using virtual visits, race/ethnicity and insurance type were not significant predictors of video use. CONCLUSION(S): Black patients used telemedicine platforms more often than White patients during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual consultation may help increase access to surgical care among traditionally under-resourced populations.Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Surgeons.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic could increase violence against children at home. However, collecting empirical data on violence is challenging due to ethical, safety, and data quality concerns. Objective(s): This study estimated the anticipated effect of COVID-19 on violent discipline at home using multivariable predictive regression models. Participant(s): Children aged 1-14 years and household members from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in Nigeria, Mongolia, and Suriname before the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Method(s): A conceptual model of how the COVID-19 pandemic could affect risk factors for violent discipline was developed. Country specific multivariable linear models were used to estimate the association between selected variables from MICS and a violent discipline score which captured the average combination of violent disciplinary methods used in the home. A review of the literature informed the development of quantitative assumptions about how COVID-19 would impact the selected variables under a "high restrictions" pandemic scenario, approximating conditions expected during a period of intense response measures, and a "lower restrictions" scenario with easing of COVID-19 restrictions but with sustained economic impacts. These assumptions were used to estimate changes in violent discipline scores. Result(s): Under a "high restrictions" scenario there would be a 35%-46% increase in violent discipline scores in Nigeria, Mongolia and Suriname, and under a "lower restrictions" scenario there would be between a 4%-6% increase in violent discipline scores in these countries. Conclusion(s): Policy makers need to plan for increases in violent discipline during successive waves of lockdowns.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {24},
   number = {1},
   pages = {672},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has seriously impacted people's daily lives and the social economy while also posing a threat to their lives. The analysis of infectious disease transmission is of significant importance for the rational allocation of epidemic prevention and control resources, the management of public health emergencies, and the improvement of future public health systems. METHOD(S): We propose a spatiotemporal COVID-19 transmission model with a neighborhood as an agent unit and an urban spatial network with long and short edge connections. The spreading model includes a network of defined agent attributes, transformation rules, and social relations and a small world network representing agents' social relations. Parameters for each stage are fitted by the Runge-Kutta method combined with the SEIR model. Using the NetLogo development platform, accurate dynamic simulations of the spatial and temporal evolution of the early epidemic were achieved. RESULT(S): Experimental results demonstrate that the fitted curves from the four stages agree with actual data, with only a 12.27% difference between the average number of infected agents and the actual number of infected agents after simulating 1 hundred times. Additionally, the model simulates and compares different "city closure" scenarios. The results showed that implementing a 'lockdown' 10days earlier would lead to the peak number of infections occurring 7 days earlier than in the normal scenario, with a reduction of 40.35% in the total number of infections. DISCUSSION: Our methodology emphasizes the crucial role of timely epidemic interventions in curbing the spread of infectious diseases, notably in the predictive assessment and evaluation of lockdown strategies. Furthermore, this approach adeptly forecasts the influence of varying intervention timings on peak infection rates and total case numbers, accurately reflecting real-world virus transmission patterns. This highlights the importance of proactive measures in diminishing epidemic impacts. It furnishes a robust framework, empowering policymakers to refine epidemic response strategies based on a synthesis of predictive modeling and empirical data.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Introduction: Health technology assessment (HTA) bodies support healthcare decision-making by producing different kind of products. The high speed of the healthcare innovations and the scenarios such as the COVID-19 pandemic challenge HTA organizations to adapt their services to better respond to these demands. The Spanish Network of HTA Agencies (RedETS) is redefining the services and the products in its portfolio. The first step has been conducting a review in order to identify the most relevant HTA products. Method(s): A scoping review with two sections was conducted: (i) analysis of results from a bibliographic search performed in the main biomedical databases; and (ii) analysis of results from a manual review of the official websites of seven international HTA agencies: CADTH (Canada), INESSS (Canada), SBU (Sweden), NICE (United Kingdom), IQWIG (Germany), HAS (France), IECS (Argentina) and IETS (Colombia). The EUnetHTA website was also reviewed. Result(s): The search identified 1,311 references; 21 studies were considered relevant. The main topic found was about rapid responses services. The standard timeline for these should be less than six months, with even some produced in days. Transparency about methodology and involvement of decision-makers were considered key points to be included. Website analysis revealed similar HTA reports production but variation in the domains and elements considered. The timeframe for conducting a full HTA report can be up to 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Agencies also offer some kinds of rapid response services. Scientific consultation and horizon scanning systems for emerging technologies are other services performed by some agencies. Conclusion(s): The review reveals that agencies have different products to address different needs throughout the life cycle of technologies: from scientific advice to full HTA. In addition, HTA agencies have incorporated rapid responses into their services. According to literature, these products could support short-term decision-making..},

   abstract = {Purpose: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic has inequitably impacted key social determinants of health (SDoH), specifically employment, housing, and health care, for U.S. transgender populations. Method(s): Between April 13, 2020 and August 3, 2020, we conducted a national, cross-sectional online survey of sexual and gender minority individuals (N = 870). We used logistic regression to calculate both unadjusted and adjusted odds of unemployment, homelessness/housing instability, and interruptions in medical care owing to the pandemic by gender and gender modality. Adjusted models controlled for age, race/ethnicity, and region. Result(s): In adjusted models, transgender and gender diverse people had 2.12 times the odds of reporting homelessness/housing instability and 2.88 times the odds of reporting medical care interruptions compared with cisgender peers. Transgender men, women, and nonbinary people had 4.12, 3.29, and 3.48 times the adjusted odds of interruptions in medical care compared with cisgender men, respectively. We did not observe significant differences in employment. Conclusion(s): Findings add empirical support to the hypothesis that socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 are inequitably impacting transgender people. To contextualize our results and support future research in this area, we present a conceptual model of the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on transgender populations using a framework of stigma as a fundamental cause of health inequities. Our findings emphasize that public health professionals must urgently consider-and intervene to address-the pandemic's SDoH-related impacts on transgender populations.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China during the outbreak and after the peak of the pandemic (N = 1313). A latent moderated mediation model was built to analyze this relationship. COVID-19 information exposure was found to relate positively with emotional distress, and risk perception mediated the association between them. Additionally, psychological resilience moderated the mediating effects of risk perception. However, five factors of resilience differed in their moderating effects.

   abstract = {Early in 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread globally, giving rise to a pandemic. In this critical scenario, patients with lung cancer need to continue to receive optimal care and at the same be shielded from infection with the potentially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Upgrades to the prevention and control of infection have become paramount in order to lower the risk of hospital contagion. Aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation or endoscopic procedures may expose health care workers to a high risk of infection. Moreover, thoracic anaesthesia usually requires highly complex airway management procedures because of the need for one-lung isolation and one-lung ventilation. Therefore, in the current pandemic, providing a fast-track algorithm for scientifically standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer is urgent. Suggestions for improving existing contagion control guidelines are needed, even in the case of non-symptomatic patients who possibly are responsible for virus spread. A COVID-19-specific intraoperative management strategy designed to reduce risk of infection in both health care workers and patients is also required.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

   abstract = {The global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent lockdown had a significant impact on people's daily lives, with strong implications for stress levels due to the threat of contagion and restrictions to freedom. Given the link between high stress levels and adverse physical and mental consequences, the COVID-19 pandemic is certainly a global public health issue. In the present study, we assessed the effect of the pandemic on stress levels in N = 2053 Italian adults, and characterized more vulnerable individuals on the basis of sociodemographic features and stable psychological traits. A set of 18 psycho-social variables, generalized regressions, and predictive machine learning approaches were leveraged. We identified higher levels of perceived stress in the study sample relative to Italian normative values. Higher levels of distress were found in women, participants with lower income, and participants living with others. Higher rates of emotional stability and self-control, as well as a positive coping style and internal locus of control, emerged as protective factors. Predictive learning models identified participants with high perceived stress, with a sensitivity greater than 76%. The results suggest a characterization of people who are more vulnerable to experiencing high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This characterization may contribute to early and targeted intervention strategies.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {14},
   pages = {1159382},
   abstract = {We examined the role of educator perceptions of school leader emotion regulation (ER) and emotional support (ES) in educator well-being during a typical year and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on emotion contagion theory, leaders' (in)ability to regulate their own emotions may trigger ripple effects of positive or negative emotions throughout their organizations, impacting staff well-being. Additionally, based on conservation of resources theory, when experiencing psychologically taxing events, skillful emotional support provided by leaders may help to replenish staff's depleted psychological resources, promoting staff well-being. In two national studies, a cross-sectional (NStudy 1 = 4,847) and a two-wave study (NStudy 2 = 2,749), we tested the association between United States preK-12 educator perceptions of school leaders' ER and ES with educator well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, employing structural equation modeling and multilevel modeling. In Studies 1 and 2, educator reports of their leaders' ER and ES skills predicted greater educator well-being, including higher positive affect and job satisfaction and lower emotional exhaustion and turnover intentions. In moderation analyses, perceived leader ER predicted well-being about equally among educators facing severe versus mild health impacts from COVID-19. In contrast, perceived leader ES was more strongly associated with educator well-being for some outcomes in those severely versus mildly impacted by COVID-19 illness and death. Leader ER played a role in the well-being of everyone, whereas leader ES was more predictive of well-being for those severely impacted by a crisis. Regarding implications for policy and practice, efforts to promote well-being among educators may be enhanced when combined with efforts to develop school leaders' ER and ES skills, especially in times of crisis. Accordingly, school districts should consider the value of investing in systematic, evidence-based emotion skills training for their leaders. Copyright © 2024 Floman, Ponnock, Jain and Brackett.},

   volume = {93},
   pages = {48-55},
   abstract = {Background: For the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic to date, we aim to analyse the patient mix in detail to characterise key sources of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the case fatality ratios (CFR). Method(s): We applied a non-parametric Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) imputation approach for patients with missing survival outcomes and adjusted for model imperfection. Semivariogram analysis and kriging were used to investigate spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Result(s): CFR estimates varied significantly between districts and over time over the course of the epidemic. BRT modelling accounted for most of the spatiotemporal variation and interactions in CFR, but moderate spatial autocorrelation remained for distances up to approximately 90 km. Combining district-level CFR estimates and kriged district-level residuals provided the best linear unbiased predicted map of CFR accounting for the both explained and unexplained spatial variation. Temporal autocorrelation was not observed in the district-level residuals from the BRT estimates. Conclusion(s): This study provides new insight into the epidemiology of the 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic with a view of informing future public health contingency planning, resource allocation and impact assessment. The analytical framework developed in this analysis, coupled with key domain knowledge, could be deployed in real time to support the response to ongoing and future outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

   title = {Excess mortality in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020-2022},
   journal = {European journal of public health},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Nordic countries represent a unique case study for the COVID-19 pandemic due to socioeconomic and cultural similarities, high-quality comparable administrative register data and notable differences in mitigation policies during the pandemic. We aimed to compare weekly excess mortality in the Nordic countries across the three full pandemic years 2020-2022. METHOD(S): Using data on weekly all-cause mortality from official administrative registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, we employed time series regression models to assess mortality developments within each pandemic year, with the period 2010-2019 used as reference period. We then compared excess mortality across the countries in 2020-2022, taking differences in population size and age- and sex-distribution into account. Results were age- and sex-standardized to the Danish population of 2020. Robustness was examined with a variety of sensitivity analyses. RESULT(S): While Sweden experienced excess mortality in 2020 [75 excess deaths per 100 000 population (95% prediction interval 29-122)], Denmark, Finland and Norway experienced excess mortality in 2022 [52 (14-90), 130 (83-177) and 88 (48-128), respectively]. Weekly death data reveal how mortality started to increase in mid-2021 in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and continued above the expected level through 2022. CONCLUSION(S): Although the Nordic countries experienced relatively low pandemic excess mortality, the impact and timing of excess mortality differed substantially. These estimates-arguably the most accurate available for any region in capturing pandemic-related excess deaths-may inform future research and policy regarding the complex mortality dynamics in times of a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

   abstract = {Introduction: Avian influenza virus is endemic in Bangladesh and maintained via a complex network of poultry value chains that covers the whole country. Aim(s): This study aims to assess (1) the socio-economic factors shaping Bangladeshi poultry value chains and (2) the consequences for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) to poultry and humans. Method(s): An inter-disciplinary approach was adopted, combining ethnography, epidemiology, virology and mathematical modelling. Overall, about 2500 poultry production stakeholders were interviewed to explore the value chains supplying Dhaka and Chittagong. This informed the design of cross-sectional and longitudinal virological and serological surveys of farmed and marketed poultry, as well as in-contact humans. Result(s): Demand and availability of poultry greatly varied according to breeds and species. While this resulted in different poultry origin and market destination patterns, value chains intertwined in markets, promoting the mixing of poultry of all breeds, species and geographical origins, as well as of their viruses. Although infection of market workers by AIVs was rare, market air and environment were highly contaminated. AIV bird-level prevalence in marketed poultry was more than 10-times as high as in farms supplying those markets, and coinfection with multiple strains was common. Model Results suggested that this viral amplification from farms to markets resulted from transmission events mainly occurring during transportation, rather than at markets. Moreover, the value chains' topologies likely resulted in various viral strain mixing patterns depending on poultry types and market locations, with consequences for the design of surveillance and control programmes. These model outputs are currently being validated through phylodynamic analyses and field experiments. We also identified actors with key roles-such as credit providers-whose choices and transaction decisions shaped poultry trade, influencing AIV infection patterns. Conclusion(s): Trading practices created conditions for the co-circulation of multiple AIV strains at high prevalence levels in the Bangladeshi poultry trading system, increasing the risk of viral reassortment. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to alter value chain structures by influencing transaction dynamics through economic incentives and promoting access to economic capital and information.},

Study design: Decision-making tool development. Method(s): Using Tugwell et al.'s 1985 Health Care Effectiveness equation as a conceptual framework, combined with a purposive search of the relevant early modeling literature, we developed six critical appraisal questions for the rapid assessment of modeling studies related to the evaluation of TTP programmes' effectiveness. Result(s): By applying the critical appraisal tool to selected recent COVID-19 modeling studies, we demonstrate how models can be evaluated using the six questions to evaluate internal and external validity and relevance. Conclusion(s): These six critical appraisal questions are able to discriminate between modeling studies of higher and lower quality and relevance to evaluating TTP programmes' impact. However, these questions require independent validation in a larger and systematic sample of relevant modeling studies which have appeared in later stages of the pandemic.Copyright © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health},

   abstract = {Background Attempts to understand biosocial phenomena using scientific methods are often presented as value-neutral and objective; however, when used to reduce the complexity of open systems such as epidemics, these forms of inquiry necessarily entail normative considerations and are therefore fashioned by political worldviews (ideologies). From the standpoint of poststructural theory, the character of these representations is at most limited and partial. In addition, these modes of representation (as stories) do work (as technologies) in the service of, or in resistance to, power. Methods We focus on a single Ebola case cluster from the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa and examine how different disciplinary forms of knowledge production (including outbreak forecasting, active epidemiological surveillance, post-outbreak serosurveys, political economic analyses, and ethnography) function as Story Technologies. We then explore how these technologies are used to curate 'data,' analysing the erasures, values, and imperatives evoked by each. Results We call attention to the instrumental-in addition to the descriptive-role Story Technologies play in ordering contingencies and establishing relationships in the wake of health crises. Discussion By connecting each type of knowledge production with the systems of power it reinforces or disrupts, we illustrate how Story Technologies do ideological work. These findings encourage research from pluriversal perspectives and advocacy for measures that promote more inclusive modes of knowledge production.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has escalated rapidly since December 2019. Understanding the ophthalmic manifestations in patients and animal models of the novel coronavirus may have implications for disease surveillance. Recognition of the potential for viral transmission through the tear film has ramification for protection of patients, physicians, and the public., METHODS: Information from relevant published journal articles was surveyed using a computerized PubMed search and public health websites. We summarize current knowledge of ophthalmic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and animal models, risk mitigation measures for patients and their providers, and implications for retina specialists., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted among humans, and while the clinical course is mild in the majority of infected patients, severe complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death can ensue, most often in elderly patients and individuals with co-morbidities. Conjunctivitis occurs in a small minority of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been identified primarily in association with conjunctivitis. Uveitis has been observed in animal models of coronavirus infection and cotton-wool spots have been reported recently., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been rarely associated with conjunctivitis. The identification of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the tear film of patients and its highly efficient transmission via respiratory aerosols supports eye protection, mask and gloves as part of infection prevention and control recommendations for retina providers. Disease surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak may also include ongoing evaluation for uveitis and retinal disease given prior findings observed in animal models and a recent report of retinal manifestations.},

The model is built upon a portfolio selection approach under the concepts of the Utility Theory. A binary integer optimization model is developed in order to find the best allocation for ICU beds, considering candidate patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Experts' subjective knowledge and prior probabilities are considered to estimate the input data for the proposed model, considering the particular aspects of the decision problem. Since the chances of survival of patients in several scenarios may not be precisely defined due to the inherent subjectivity of such kinds of information, the proposed model works based on imprecise information provided by users. A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to build a recommendation, and a robustness index is computed for each alternative according to its performance as evidenced by the results of the simulation.Copyright © 2021 Eduarda Asfora Frej et al.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether citizens' adherence to health-protective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic is predicted by identity leadership, wherein leaders are perceived to create a sense of shared national identity. DESIGN: Observational two-wave study. Hypotheses testing was conducted with structural equation modelling. SETTING: Data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Germany, Israel and the USA in April/May 2020 and fourweeks later. PARTICIPANTS: Adults in China (n=548, 66.6%women), Germany (n=182, 78%women), Israel (n=198, 51.0%women) and the USA (n=108, 58.3%women). MEASURES: Identity leadership (assessed by the four-item Identity Leadership Inventory Short-Form) at Time 1, perceived shared national identification (PSNI; assessed with four items) and adherence to health-protective NPIs (assessed with 10 items that describe different health-protective interventions; for example, wearing face masks) at Time 2. RESULT(S): Identity leadership was positively associated with PSNI (95%CI 0.11 to 0.30, p<0.001) in all countries. This, in turn, was related to more adherence to health-protective NPIs in all countries (95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, 0.001<=p<=0.017) except Israel (95%CI -0.03 to 0.27, p=0.119). In Germany, the more people saw Chancellor Merkel as engaging in identity leadership, the more they adhered to health-protective NPIs (95%CI 0.04 to 0.18, p=0.002). In the USA, in contrast, the more people perceived President Trump as engaging in identity leadership, the less they adhered to health-protective NPIs (95%CI -0.17 to -0.04, p=0.002). CONCLUSION(S): National leaders can make a difference by promoting a sense of shared identity among their citizens because people are more inclined to follow health-protective NPIs to the extent that they feel part of a united 'us'. However, the content of identity leadership (perceptions of what it means to be a nation's citizen) is essential, because this can also encourage people to disregard such recommendations.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

   abstract = {Recent reports using conventional Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed models suggest that the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK could overwhelm health services, with fatalities exceeding the first wave. We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. We used dynamic causal modelling to estimate the evidence for alternative models of daily cases and deaths from the USA, the UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Belgium, Germany and Canada over the period 25 January 2020 to 15 June 2020. These data were used to estimate the proportions of people (i) not exposed to the virus, (ii) not susceptible to infection when exposed and (iii) not infectious when susceptible to infection. Bayesian model comparison furnished overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient to explain large differences in mortality rates. The best model of UK data predicts a second surge of fatalities will be much less than the first peak. The size of the second wave depends sensitively on the loss of immunity and the efficacy of Find-Test-Trace-Isolate-Support programmes. In summary, accounting for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially, the potential of public health programmes. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

   abstract = {Pervasive human and organizational factors (HOFs) within the public sectors play a vital role in the prevention and control of epidemic (PCE). Insufficient analysis of HOFs has helped continue the use of flawed precautions. In this study, we attempted to establish a quantitative model to (a) clarify HOFs within the public sectors with regard to PCE, (b) predict the probability of relevant risk factors and an epidemic, and (c) diagnose the critical factors. First, we systematically identified 47 HOFs based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). We then converted the HFACS framework into a Bayesian Network (BN) after determining the causalities among these factors. Finally, we applied the hybrid HFACS-BN model to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in China by virtue of its efficacy in probability prediction and diagnosis of key risk factors, and thus to test the feasibility of the model itself. This study contributes to a holistic analysis of HOFs within the public sectors with regard to PCE by providing a risk assessment model for epidemics or pandemics, and developing risk analysis methods for the public health field.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 by WHO, due to its great threat to global public health. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is essential for processing and maturation of the viral polyprotein, therefore recognized as an attractive drug target. Here we show that a clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting Mpro. Moreover, combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), results in sterilizing additive effect. Further structural analysis reveals binding of both inhibitors to the catalytically active side of SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro as main mechanism of inhibition. Our findings may provide critical information for the optimization and design of more potent inhibitors against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.},

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {675687},
   abstract = {The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has had a huge impact on people's lives all over the world, and the overwhelmingly negative information about the epidemic has made people panic for the future. This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying. Finally, two cases are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.Copyright © 2021 Fu, Jing, Chen, Xu, Yang and Cong.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented social and mobility restrictions on a global scale. Since its start in the spring of 2020, numerous scientific papers have been published on the characteristics of the virus, and the healthcare, economic and social consequences of the pandemic. However, in-depth analyses of the evolution of single coronavirus outbreaks have been rarely reported. Method(s): In this paper, we analyze the main properties of all the tracked COVID-19 outbreaks in the Valencian Region between September and December of 2020. Our analysis includes the evaluation of the origin, dynamic evolution, duration, and spatial distribution of the outbreaks. Result(s): We find that the duration of the outbreaks follows a power-law distribution: most outbreaks are controlled within 2 weeks of their onset, and only a few last more than 2 months. We do not identify any significant differences in the outbreak properties with respect to the geographical location across the entire region. Finally, we also determine the cluster size distribution of each infection origin through a Bayesian statistical model. Discussion(s): We hope that our work will assist in optimizing and planning the resource assignment for future pandemic tracking efforts.Copyright © 2022 Fuente, Hervas, Rebollo, Conejero and Oliver.},

   abstract = {Psychological and mental health consequences of large-scale anti-contagion policies are assuming strong relevance in the COVID-19 pandemic. We proposed a specific focus on a large sample of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), developing an ad hoc instrument to investigate changes occurred in specific (sub-)domains during a period of national lockdown (Italy). Our questionnaire, named AutiStress, is both context-specific (being set in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario) and condition-specific (being structured taking into account the autistic functioning peculiarities in the paediatric age). An age- and gender-matched group of neurotypical (TD) controls was also provided. As expected, the severe lockdown policies had a general negative impact both on ASD and TD children, reflecting the obvious burden of the pandemic situation. However, our findings also indicate that children with ASD experienced more positive changes than TD ones. Noteworthy, we report a thought-provoking double dissociation in the context-specific predictor (i.e., accessibility to private outdoor spaces), indicating that it impacts differently on the two groups. Focusing on the ASD group, results suggest a condition-specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on core autistic (sub-)domains. Taken together, our data call for a multi-layered, context- and condition-specific analysis of the pandemic burden beyond any oversimplification.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

In this research, our goal was to perform a Bibliometric Network Analysis (BNA) to investigate the strategic themes, thematic evolution structure and trends of coronavirus during the first eight months of COVID-19 in the Web of Science (WoS) database in 2020. To do this, 14,802 articles were analyzed, with the support of the SciMAT software. This analysis highlights 24 themes, of which 11 of the more important ones were discussed in-depth. The thematic evolution structure shows how the themes are evolving over time, and the most developed and future trends of coronavirus with focus on COVID-19 were visually depicted. The results of the strategic diagram highlight 'CHLOROQUINE', 'ANXIETY', 'PREGNANCY' and 'ACUTE-RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME', among others, as the clusters with the highest number of associated citations. The thematic evolution. structure presented two thematic areas: "Damage prevention and containment of COVID-19" and "Comorbidities and diseases caused by COVID-19", which provides new perspectives and futures trends of the field. These results will form the basis for future research and guide decision-making in coronavirus focused on COVID-19 research and treatments.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and despite efforts to identify and control cardiovascular risk factors, significant disease burden remains. As traditional strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk are challenged by lack of resources and growing populations, new strategies are deployed, including the use of smartphone applications (apps) designed to help patients manage their risk factors. For cardiovascular disease, some apps specifically address one risk factor, but others include a more holistic approach to manage multiple risk factors at once for primary and secondary prevention, whereas others serve as virtual cardiac rehabilitation intervention support. App stores show thousands of options in each app category, making it difficult to select the appropriate ones to recommend to patients. Very few apps in the app stores are rigorously validated for clinical efficacy or safety, making selection even more challenging. To address this, health organizations worldwide have created platforms to examine and appraise mobile health apps using standardized criteria to support clinician and patient app selection decisions. Now, with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged lockdowns have challenged traditional models of care. Telemedicine for cardiovascular disease patients is advancing virtual cardiac rehabilitation models to replace or improve traditional care.Copyright © 2020 Les Laboratoires Seriver.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and related school disruptions have led to increased concerns for the mental health of teachers. This study investigated how the challenges and systemic supports perceived by teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with their mental health and workplace well-being. This cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted in February 2021, just prior to the third wave of the pandemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada (N = 1,276). Four multivariable linear regression models examined the associations between teachers' pandemic-related challenges (pandemic-related personal stressors, teacher workload, difficulty implementing safety measures, meeting students' needs), systemic supports (education system mental health and well-being support), and four mental health (psychological distress, and quality of life) and workplace well-being outcomes (job-related positive affect, turnover intentions), adjusting for sociodemographic and school characteristics. The Pratt index (d) was used to assess the relative importance of each predictor. A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted on teachers' open-ended responses. Teachers' workplace well-being (job-related positive affect and turnover intentions) was predominantly associated with their perceptions of education system support for their mental health and well-being (d = 46%, d = 41%, respectively). The most important predictor of general mental health (psychological distress and quality of life) was the number of COVID-19 related personal stressors teachers reported (d = 64%, d = 43%, respectively). The qualitative analyses corroborated and expanded upon the quantitative findings. Understanding pandemic-related challenges and supports impacting teacher mental health and workplace well-being equips us to make evidence-informed policy decisions to support teachers now and in future school disruptions.Copyright © 2023 Gadermann et al.

   abstract = {Background: Novel coronavirus disease has been recently a concern for worldwide public health. To determine epidemic rate probability at any time in any region of interest, one needs efficient bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-regional environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of novel coronavirus infection rate. Traditional statistical methods dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes do not have the multi-dimensionality advantage, that suggested methodology offers, namely dealing efficiently with multiple regions at the same time and accounting for cross-correlations between different regional observations., Methods: Modern multi-dimensional novel statistical method was directly applied to raw clinical data, able to deal with territorial mapping. Novel reliability method based on statistical extreme value theory has been suggested to deal with challenging epidemic forecast. Authors used MATLAB optimization software., Results: This paper described a novel bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-country environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of extreme novel coronavirus death rate probability. Namely, accurate maximum recorded patient numbers are predicted for the years to come for the analyzed provinces., Conclusions: The suggested method performed well by supplying not only an estimate but 95% confidence interval as well. Note that suggested methodology is not limited to any specific epidemics or any specific terrain, namely its truly general. The only assumption and limitation is bio-system stationarity, alternatively trend analysis should be performed first. The suggested methodology can be used in various public health applications, based on their clinical survey data. Copyright: © 2023 Gaidai O et al.},

   abstract = {Social media can forecast disease dynamics, but infoveillance remains focused on infection spread, with little consideration of media content reliability and its relationship to behavior-driven epidemiological outcomes. Sentiment-encoded social media indicators have been poorly developed for expressed text to forecast healthcare pressure and infer population risk-perception patterns. Here we introduce Infodemic Tomography (InTo) as the first web-based interactive infoveillance cybertechnology that forecasts and visualizes spatio-temporal sentiments and healthcare pressure as a function of social media positivity (i.e., Twitter here), considering both epidemic information and potential misinformation. Information spread is measured on volume and retweets, and the Value of Misinformation (VoMi) is introduced as the impact on forecast accuracy where misinformation has the highest dissimilarity in information dynamics. We validated InTo for COVID-19 in New Delhi and Mumbai by inferring distinct socio-epidemiological risk-perception patterns. We forecast weekly hospitalization and cases using ARIMA models and interpolate spatial hospitalization using geostatistical kriging on inferred risk perception curves between tweet positivity and epidemiological outcomes. Geospatial tweet positivity tracks accurately [Formula: see text]60[Formula: see text] of hospitalizations and forecasts hospitalization risk hotspots along risk aversion gradients. VoMi is higher for risk-prone areas and time periods, where misinformation has the highest non-linear predictability, with high incidence and positivity manifesting popularity-seeking social dynamics. Hospitalization gradients, VoMi, effective healthcare pressure and spatial model-data gaps can be used to predict hospitalization fluxes, misinformation, healthcare capacity gaps and surveillance uncertainty. Thus, InTo is a participatory instrument to better prepare and respond to public health crises by extracting and combining salient epidemiological and social surveillance at any desired space-time scale.Copyright © 2022.

   volume = {50},

   pages = {S27},
   abstract = {Background: The current shortage of healthcare workers (HCW) across the country has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of infection preventionist (IP) is no exception. As a result, a shift to broaden the scope of HCWs entering IP has gained attention. This study sought to compare competency expectations between medical technologists (MT) and IPs to better understand the bridge between the two professions, with the intent of highlighting MTs as qualified candidates for novice IP positions. Method(s): This study evaluated available competency guidelines for MTs and compared them to the 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) competency model for the IP. The primary source used for this study was the Competency Guidelines for Laboratory Professionals resource made available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Supplemental competency data was drawn from a research article focused on MTs with 3-5 years of experience. Domains within the CDC's model were determined to either be completely, partially, or not addressed within APIC's model. The 6 primary domains and 32 subdomains of the APIC model were then compared to the CDC model, both with and without the supplemental article data, and results evaluated. Result(s): Results showed a 74% complete and partial match between the APIC 2019 competency model and domains within the CDC MT competency model, or 28 of 38 domains. When supplemental competency data was included for MTs with 3-5 years of experience with additional education, there was an 82% complete and partial match between sources, or 31 of 38 domains. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that MTs, particularly with 3-5 years of experience with additional education, possess a strong foundational knowledge set for novice IP positions. Hiring managers should strongly consider MT applicants for open IP positions moving forward.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {Accurate forecasts can inform response to outbreaks. Most efforts in influenza forecasting have focused on predicting influenza-like activity, with fewer on influenza-related hospitalizations. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate a super learner's predictions of 3 seasonal measures of influenza hospitalizations in the United States: peak hospitalization rate, peak hospitalization week, and cumulative hospitalization rate. We trained an ensemble machine learning algorithm on 15,000 simulated hospitalization curves and generated weekly predictions. We compared the performance of the ensemble (weighted combination of predictions from multiple prediction algorithms), the best-performing individual prediction algorithm, and a naive prediction (median of a simulated outcome distribution). Ensemble predictions performed similarly to the naive predictions early in the season but consistently improved as the season progressed for all prediction targets. The best-performing prediction algorithm in each week typically had similar predictive accuracy compared with the ensemble, but the specific prediction algorithm selected varied by week. An ensemble super learner improved predictions of influenza-related hospitalizations, relative to a naive prediction. Future work should examine the super learner's performance using additional empirical data on influenza-related predictors (e.g., influenza-like illness). The algorithm should also be tailored to produce prospective probabilistic forecasts of selected prediction targets.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Recently, the generalized-growth model was introduced as a flexible approach to characterize growth dynamics of disease outbreaks during the early ascending phase. In this work, by using classical maximum likelihood estimation to obtain parameter estimates, we evaluate the impact of varying levels of overdispersion on the inference of the growth scaling parameter through comparing Poisson and Negative binomial models. In particular, under exponential and sub-exponential growth scenarios, we evaluate, via simulations, the error rate of making an incorrect characterization of early outbreak growth patterns. Simulation results show that the ability to correctly identify early outbreak growth patterns can be affected by overdispersion even when accounted for using the Negative binomial model. We exemplify our findings using data on five different outbreaks. Overall, our results show that estimates should be interpreted with caution when data are overdispersed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: COVID-19 is in its epidemic period, and China is still facing the dual risks of import and domestic rebound. To better control the COVID-19 pandemic under the existing conditions, the focus of this study is to simulate the nucleic acid testing for different population size cities in China to influence the spread of COVID-19, assess the situation under different scenarios, the demand for the laboratory testing personnel, material resources, for the implementation of the nucleic acid screening measures, emergency supplies, and the configuration of human resources to provide decision-making basis. Method(s): According to the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 and the current prevention and control strategies in China, four epidemic scenarios were assumed. Based on the constructed SVEAIiQHR model, the number of people infected with COVID-19 in cities with populations of 10 million, 5 million, and 500,000 was analyzed and predicted under the four scenarios, and the demand for laboratory testing resources was evaluated, respectively. Result(s): For large, medium, and small cities, whether full or regional nucleic acid screening can significantly reduce the epidemic prevention and control strategy of different scenarios laboratory testing resource demand difference is bigger, implement effective non-pharmaceutical interventions and regional nucleic acid screening measures to significantly reduce laboratory testing related resources demand, but will cause varying degrees of inspection staff shortages. Conclusion(s): There is still an urgent need for laboratory testing manpower in China to implement effective nucleic acid screening measures in the event of an outbreak. Cities or regions with different population sizes and levels of medical resources should flexibly implement prevention and control measures according to specific conditions after the outbreak, assess laboratory testing and human resource need as soon as possible, and prepare and allocate materials and personnel.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Importance: A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed. Objective(s): To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Exposure: State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. Result(s): Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was -0.586 (95% CI, -0.742 to -0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence..Copyright © 2020 American Medical Association.

   volume = {17},
   pages = {100597},
   abstract = {Mpox is an ongoing viral zoonotic disease epidemic worldwide. Being different from conventional animal-to-human transmission, the present outbreak is mainly caused by human-to-human transmission of Mpox virus, putting forward the risk of worldwide epidemic. The current spatial distribution characteristics and risk area prediction are urgently needed for preparedness for prevention and control of the disease based on the One Health strategy. In the present study, the global outbreak point of Mpox virus were collected and used to predict potential global risk of Mpox virus with ecological niche model constructed with a combination of eco-geographical, anthropoid, meteorological, and host variables. The results showed that human factors are the key to the risk and prevalence of Mpox. The risk map indicated that Mpox may affect extensive areas worldwide. Europe and North America have the highest risk of Mpox. Although most areas have never recorded Mpox before, there are some high-risk areas in Asia. Our findings highlight population density is the most important contributing factor for high-risk area. Many large cities with dense populations, developed transportation, and high migration rate in the world, are in high risks. At present, the spread of Mpox is highly valued in the world and strict prevention and control measures have been taken. However, under the influence of human factors, Mpox has the potential of a global pandemic. The risk area prediction and main risk factors provide key information for targeted preparedness for prevention and control of Mpox outbreak and avoiding potential global epidemic through the One Health approach.Copyright © 2023},

   pages = {55-70},
   abstract = {Every epidemic affects the real lives of many people around the world and leads to terrible consequences. Recently, many tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic have been shared publicly on social media platforms. The analysis of these tweets is helpful for emergency response organizations to prioritize their tasks and make better decisions. However, most of these tweets are non-informative, which is a challenge for establishing an automated system to detect useful information in social media. Furthermore, existing methods ignore unlabeled data and topic background knowledge, which can provide additional semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel Topic-Aware BERT (TABERT) model to solve the above challenges. TABERT first leverages a topic model to extract the latent topics of tweets. Secondly, a flexible framework is used to combine topic information with the output of BERT. Finally, we adopt adversarial training to achieve semi-supervised learning, and a large amount of unlabeled data can be used to improve inner representations of the model. Experimental results on the dataset of COVID-19 English tweets show that our model outperforms classic and state-of-the-art baselines.

   abstract = {Since its emergence late in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exude major public health and socio-economic burden globally. South Africa is currently the epicenter for the pandemic in Africa. This study is based on the use of a compartmental model to analyze the transmission dynamics of the disease in South Africa. A notable feature of the model is the incorporation of the role of environmental contamination by COVID-infected individuals. The model, which is fitted and parametrized using cumulative mortality data from South Africa, is used to assess the impact of various control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its associated continuum of disease-free equilibria is globally-asymptotically stable whenever the control reproduction number is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the disease will eventually die out, particularly if control measures are implemented early and for a sustainable period of time. For instance, numerical simulations suggest that if the lockdown measures in South Africa were implemented a week later than the 26 March, 2020 date it was implemented, this will result in the extension of the predicted peak time of the pandemic, and causing about 10% more cumulative deaths. In addition to illustrating the effectiveness of self-isolation in reducing the number of cases, our study emphasizes the importance of surveillance testing and contact tracing of the contacts and confirmed cases in curtailing the pandemic in South Africa.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions had to swiftly adapt and transition to remote teaching in order to maintain academic activities. However, these changes presented a number of challenges for professors, which could have negative effects on their health. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze the association between changes in dietary and sleep habits, physical activity level, and sedentary behavior with the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among Brazilian higher education professors during the pandemic period. METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional and retrospective study conducted using an online form. Generalized linear models, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index, were used to verify the difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Logistic regression models were used to predict the odds ratio (OR) for the development of NCDs according to physical activity time, sedentary behavior time, dietary and sleep patterns. RESULT(S): A total of 936 professors residing across Brazil participated in the survey. The duration of sedentary behavior increased, sleep duration slightly decreased, and meal times shifted to earlier during the pandemic. A total of 22.9%of the participants reported the diagnosis of some NCDs during this period. Physical activity practice was associated with a lower risk of diseases during the pandemic, regardless of the intensity performed. On the other hand, late eating habits and excessive food consumption during the pandemic were associated with a higher risk. CONCLUSION(S): The results provide data that can help in the development of public policies that promote health actions to minimize the consequences associated with the pandemic period.},

   abstract = {Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities to move the completion of university studies online. Spain's National Conference of Medical School Deans coordinates an objective, structured clinical competency assessment called the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), which consists of 20 face-to-face test sections for students in their sixth year of study. As a result of the pandemic, a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE) has been designed. The objective of this article is to describe the creation, administration, and development of the test. Material(s) and Method(s): This work is a descriptive study of the CCS-OSCE from its planning stages in April 2020 to its administration in June 2020. Result(s): The CCS-OSCE evaluated the competences of anamnesis, exploration, clinical judgment, ethical aspects, interprofessional relations, prevention, and health promotion. No technical or communication skills were evaluated. The CCS-OSCE consisted of ten test sections, each of which had a 12-minutes time limit and ranged from six to 21 questions (mean: 1.1 minutes/question). The CCS-OSCE used the virtual campus platform of each of the 16 participating medical schools, which had a total of 2,829 students in their sixth year of study. It was jointly held on two dates in June 2020. Conclusion(s): The CCS-OSCE made it possible to bring together the various medical schools and carry out interdisciplinary work. The CCS-OSCE conducted may be similar to Step 3 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Interna (SEMI)},

   abstract = {Mosquitoes are primary vectors of pathogens impacting humans, wildlife, and livestock. Among them, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, stands out as an invasive species with a global distribution, having established populations on every continent except Antarctica. Recent findings incriminate Ae. albopictus in the local transmission of several pathogens causing human diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses and worm parasites as Dirofilaria. In Spain, the establishment of Ae. albopictus occurred in 2004 and it rapidly expanded, currently reaching southern provinces and creating novel epidemiological scenarios in recently invaded areas. In this study, we conducted captures of Ae. albopictus from May to November 2022 in two provinces, Granada and Malaga, situated near the current edge of the species' expanding range in Spain. The objective was to identify the primary factors influencing their captures in these regions. Mosquitoes were captured using BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO2 and BG-Lure, and miniature CDC-UV traps in five different localities. Our findings underscore the influence of both extrinsic factors, such as locality, and intrinsic factors, including mosquito sex, on the abundance of captured Ae. albopictus. A higher abundance of Ae. albopictus was observed in the Malaga province compared to localities in the Granada province. Furthermore, similar numbers of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were captured in more urbanized areas of Granada, while the lowest counts were recorded in the less urbanized area. These results were compared to captures of another common species in the area, specifically Culex pipiens. Overall, these results represent the first monitoring of invasive Ae. albopictus in the area and are discussed in the light of the potential importance of the species as a nuisance for humans and vectors of pathogens of public health relevance.Copyright © 2024.

   abstract = {The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number (R0 = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.Copyright © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the importance of treatment-related decision making in populations. This article considers the case where the transmission rate of the disease as well as the efficiency of treatments is subject to uncertainty. We consider two different regimes, or submodels, of the stochastic SIR model, where the population consists of three groups: susceptible, infected and recovered and dead. In the first regime the proportion of infected is very low, and the proportion of susceptible is very close to 100the proportion of infected is moderate, but not negligible. We show that the first regime corresponds almost exactly to a well-known problem in finance, the problem of portfolio and consumption decisions under mean-reverting returns (Wachter, JFQA 2002), for which the optimal control has an analytical solution. We develop a perturbative solution for the second problem. To our knowledge, this paper represents one of the first attempts to develop analytical/perturbative solutions, as opposed to numerical solutions to stochastic SIR models.

   abstract = {Since its emergence in China, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly around the world. Faced with this unknown disease, public health authorities were forced to experiment, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modeling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modeling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modeling framework called COVID-19 Modeling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based 1-h time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model. It is designed to be modular and flexible enough to allow modelers and users to represent different strategies and study their impacts in multiple social, epidemiological or economic scenarios. Several large-scale experiments are analyzed in this paper and allow us to show the potentialities of COMOKIT in terms of analysis and comparison of the impacts of public health policies in a realistic case study.

Five stages have been taken into consideration according to four-tier response to Public Health Crisis, which comes from the National Contingency Plan in China. Staggered basic reproduction number has been derived and we evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing policies under different scenarios among 19 cities/regions in mainland China. Further, we estimate the infection risk associated with the sequential release based on population mobility between cities and the intensity of some non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results reveal that Level I public health emergency response is necessary for high-risk cities, which can flatten the COVID-19 curve effectively and quickly. Moreover, properly designed staggered-release policies are extremely significant for the prevention and control of COVID-19, furthermore, beneficial to economic activities and social stability and development.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic-related BMI gain and obesity prevalence changes in children have not been clearly elucidated, especially in China. This study aims to assess the impact of pandemic-related BMI and obesity prevalence change in Chinese children aged 8-12 years. Method(s): On the basis of the Health Promotion Program for Children and Adolescents in Suzhou of China, a total of 72,175 children aged 8-12 years with complete data during 2017-2020 were included. Yearly BMI z-score changes and age- and sex-adjusted BMI changes before (2017-2019) and during (2019-2020) the pandemic were calculated. Multivariate mixed linear models were used to examine the possible difference in annual BMI change rate before and during the pandemic among subgroups. Result(s): The obesity prevalence slightly increased from 12.29% (2017) to 13.28% (2019) but substantially increased to 15.29% in 2020. The mean yearly change in BMI z-score before and during the pandemic were 0.039 (95% CI=0.037, 0.042) and 0.131 (95% CI=0.125, 0.138), respectively, yielding a difference of 0.092 (95% CI=0.087, 0.096). Similarly, changes and age- and sex-adjusted BMI increased by 0.191 (95% CI=0.179, 0.202) during the pandemic compared with those of previous years. Meanwhile, the increase in BMI changes in 2019-2020 compared with that before the pandemic was more obvious in boys than in girls and in underweight or normal-weight children than in their overweight and obese counterparts. Conclusion(s): BMI gain increased among Chinese children aged 8-12 years during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to formulate effective public health policies to reduce the risk of pandemic-related childhood obesity.Copyright © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

   abstract = {The study describes epidemiological features and transmission of other infectious diarrhea (OID) before and during the epidemic of COVID-19 in China, which lays a foundation for OID prevention and control. Incidence rate and mortality data of OID containing detailed epidemiological information such as date, age and region from 2004 to 2017, and total OID case number from 2018 to 2020 were obtained from the Data Center of China's Public Health Science and the National Bureau of Statistics' statistical yearbook. The Joinpoint regression model and Z test was used to analyze, while R language and ArcGIS 10.5 for drawing. The autoregressive integrated moving average model was used to predict the influence of COVID-19 on OID. The OID incidence rate increased from 31.69/10 million in 2004 to 92.42/10 million in 2017, and the mortality rate decreased from 1.82/10,000 to 0.14/10,000. The male to female incidence ratio was 1.39:1 (P < .001). The patients' age showed a decreased trend with age (P < .001). The scattered children devoted the most OID incidence rate. The bimodal distribution of OID incidence was summer peak in northern China, 2 apparent peaks in central and eastern, and winter peak in southern. The autoregressive integrated moving average model predicted 1,406,557 in 2020, comparing the actual OID cases in 2020 to 1,062,277. Affected by the epidemic control measures of COVID-19, the number of OID cases declined by 32.4% (Absolute percentage error=32.4%). The OID incidence rate in China continuously increased and showed a bimodal distribution in summer and winter with inconspicuous regional characteristics, gender and age susceptibility differences, and occupational differences. Meanwhile, COVID-19 significantly reduced OID incidence in 2020. The discoveries might bring a beneficial effect on OID prevention and control policies.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

   volume = {21},

   pages = {604},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of the COVID-19 outbreak has led policymakers around the world to attempt transmission control. However, lockdown and shutdown interventions have caused new social problems and designating policy resumption for infection control when reopening society remains a crucial issue. We investigated the effects of different resumption strategies on COVID-19 transmission using a modeling study setting. METHOD(S): We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on China's business resumption progress. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves vis-a-vis confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. Two-sample t-test was performed in order to affirm that the pick values in different scenarios are different. RESULT(S): We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50 and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high. CONCLUSION(S): Business resumption strategies have the potential to eliminate COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening without special control measures. The proposed resumption strategies focused mainly on decreasing the number of imported exposure cases, guaranteeing medical support for epidemic control, or decreasing active cases.},

   abstract = {Analysis of genetic sequence data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can provide insights into epidemic origins, worldwide dispersal, and epidemiological history. With few exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets with few isolates in any given location. Here, we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS- CoV-2 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate a mean basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.4 (95% highest posterior density interval: 2.1-5.2) in Weifang, and a mean effective reproduction number (Rt) that falls below 1 on 4 February. We further estimate the number of infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

   abstract = {The spatial template over which COVID-19 infections operate is a result of nested societal decisions involving complex political and epidemiological processes at a broad range of spatial scales. It is characterized by 'hotspots' of high infections interspersed within regions where infections are sporadic to absent. In this work, the sparseness of COVID-19 infections and their time variations were analyzed across the US at scales ranging from 10 km (county scale) to 2600 km (continental scale). It was found that COVID-19 cases are multi-scaling with a multifractality kernel that monotonically approached that of the underlying population. The spatial correlation of infections between counties increased rapidly in March 2020; that rise continued but at a slower pace subsequently, trending towards the spatial correlation of the population agglomeration. This shows that the disease had already spread across the USA in early March such that travel restriction thereafter (starting on March 15th 2020) had minor impact on the subsequent spatial propagation of COVID-19. The ramifications of targeted interventions on spatial patterns of new infections were explored using the epidemiological susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model mapped onto the population agglomeration template. These revealed that re-opening rural areas would have a smaller impact on the spread and evolution of the disease than re-opening urban (dense) centers which would disturb the system for months. This study provided a novel way for interpreting the spatial spread of COVID-19, along with a practical approach (multifractals/SIR/spectral slope) that could be employed to capture the variability and intermittency at all scales while maintaining the spatial structure.

   journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},
   volume = {118},
   number = {21},
   abstract = {The tempo-spatial patterns of Covid-19 infections are a result of nested personal, societal, and political decisions that involve complicated epidemiological dynamics across overlapping spatial scales. High infection "hotspots" interspersed within regions where infections remained sporadic were ubiquitous early in the outbreak, but the spatial signature of the infection evolved to affect most regions equally, albeit with distinct temporal patterns. The sparseness of Covid-19 infections in the United States was analyzed at scales spanning from 10 to 2,600 km (county to continental scale). Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders. This study provides an original interpretation of Covid-19 spread together with a pragmatic approach that can be imminently used to capture the spatial intermittency at all epidemiologically relevant scales while preserving the "disordered" spatial pattern of infectious cases.

The same is in other countries, the local government in Jakarta taking some emergency decisions to minimize the virus spreading including the movement control order (MCO). This paper discusses the simulation of COVID-19 spreading in the early stage in Jakarta using a different model of disease spreading available on The Spatiotemporal Epidemiologic Modeler (STEM). The focus of this simulation is to see the effect of MCO on the COVID-19 spreading in the local area in Indonesia. The result shows that the MCO contribute to the decreasing of case number with some certain period of lag time.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The current emergency due to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a great concern for global public health. Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs. An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV. Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness has not yet been assessed. The main protease (Mpr) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors. We identified potent Mpr inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library. MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches. Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects. Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpr inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.},

   abstract = {Two decades after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, Asia is confronted with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has significantly affected the region's economy. In a novel general equilibrium model, we introduce epidemiological dynamics to the production network between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In this model, agents' risk-averse behavior during pandemics leads to shifting demands across economic sectors. We calibrate the model with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) inter-country input-output tables for pre-SARS and pre-COVID-19 periods and control for disease dynamics across years. Findings show that in the absence of policy interventions, China's greater significance in global value chains is associated with substantial economic impacts, within China and the ASEAN region. Our sensitivity analyses further show that China's containment efforts reduce the spillover effects on ASEAN. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Many studies have been carried out in modelling COVID-19 pandemic. However, region-wise average duration of recovery from COVID-19 has not been attempted; hence, an effort has been made to estimate state-wise recovery duration of India's COVID-19 patients. Determining the recovery time in each region is intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing better care and planning of logistics. Method(s): This study used database provided by Kaggle, which takes data from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The simple Linear Regression model between incidence, prevalence, and duration was used to assess the duration of COVID-19 disease in various Indian states. Result(s): The fitted model suits ideal for most of the states, except for some union territories and northeastern states. The average time to recover from disease was ranging from 5 to 36 days in Indian states/union territories except for Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively. Conclusion(s): The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

Yet, the effectiveness of these measures depends on people's levels of adherence. In this article, we apply social-psychological research to the study of compliance with personal protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. We consider three possible models underlying adherence: (1) sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, (2) instrumental factors, and (3) normative factors. We draw on data from a longitudinal nonrepresentative panel study (Study 1, n = 32,304) and a cross-sectional representative survey (Study 2, n = 1,078) to explore the impact of these different factors on personal protective measures compliance. Findings show the strongest support for the role of instrumental and normative factors, in that people who comply with protective measures report to a greater extent that relatives and friends comply too and tend to perceive high risk of COVID-19. We finish by proposing policy recommendations to promote effective strategies to contain the spread of the virus. Copyright © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedent impact of everyday life with deleterious consequences on global health, economics, and society. Thus, accurate and timely information is critical for monitoring its spread and mitigating its impact. ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot with artificial intelligence, developed by OpenAI, that can provide both textual content and R code for predictive models. It may prove to be useful in analyzing and interpreting COVID-19-related data. METHOD(S): This paper explores the application of ChatGPT to the monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting R code for predictive models and demonstrating the model's capabilities in sentiment analysis, information extraction, and predictive modelling. We used the prediction models suggested by ChatGPT to predict the daily number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy. The prediction accuracy of the models was compared using the following metrics: mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root mean squared error (RMSE). RESULT(S): ChatGPT suggested three different predictive models, including ARIMA, Random Forest and Prophet. The ARIMA model outperformed the other two models in predicting the daily number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy, with lower MSE, MAD, and RMSE values as compared to the Random Forest and Prophet. CONCLUSION(S): This paper demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT as a valuable tool in the monitoring of the pandemic. By processing large amounts of data and providing relevant information, ChatGPT has the potential to provide accurate and timely insights, and support decision-making processes to mitigate the spread and impact of pandemics. The paper highlights the importance of exploring the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the management of public emergencies and provides a starting point for future research in this area.},

   abstract = {Introduction: School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Method(s): We used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools for the period of August 15, 2020 to April 11, 2021. Our simulation was carried out in early September 2020 and was based on the latest (at the time) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Pandemic Planning Scenarios released in May 2020. We explored different reopening scenarios including virtual learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts in order to reduce exposure and pathogen spread. Result(s): Scenarios where cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats, which we refer to as hybrid scenarios, resulted in significant decreases in the percentage of symptomatic individuals with COVID-19, by as much as 75%. These hybrid scenarios have only slightly more negative health impacts of COVID-19 compared to implementing a 100% virtual learning scenario. Hybrid scenarios can significantly avert the number of COVID-19 cases at the national scale-approximately between 28 M and 60 M depending on the scenario-over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Conclusion(s): In an evolving pandemic, while a large proportion of people remain susceptible, reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes; part-time in-classroom education substantially reduces health risks.Copyright © 2022},

   journal = {Water Research X},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {100086},
   abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic, with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy. Although SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals, thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence. Numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and wastewater-associated solids/sludge. However, the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions, or are instead driven by methodological artifacts. The current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods, detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds from March-May 2020, and better understand the potential link between COVID-19 incidence/prevalence and wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate recovery (0.34%-55%) and equivalent sample volume (0.1 mL-1 L) differed between methods and target water matrices, ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations. Composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a ~10-fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples, presumably highlighting diurnal variability in SARS-CoV-2 signal. Detection and quantification of four SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers (up to ~106 gene copies per liter), along with ratios of SARS-CoV-2 to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), exhibited comparability with public health data for two sewersheds in an early phase of the pandemic. Finally, a wastewater model informed by fecal shedding rates highlighted the potential significance of new cases (i.e., incidence rather than prevalence) when interpreting wastewater surveillance data.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {Background: No versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to comprehensively analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The http://covid-webapp.numerusinc.com/ web app presented here fills this gap. Method(s): Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies susceptible, contact, latent, asymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered classes of individuals, and a parallel set of response classes, subject to lower pathogen-contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file of incidence and, if of interest, mortality rate data. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a user-selected subset of these can be fitted to the model using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). Model fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allow counterfactual and forecasting scenarios. Confidence or credible intervals can be generated using stochastic simulations, based on MLE values, or on an inputted CSV file containing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of one or more parameters. Result(s): We illustrate the use of our web app in extracting social distancing, social relaxation, surveillance or virulence switching functions (i.e., time varying drivers) from the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 epidemics in Israel, South Africa, and England. The Israeli outbreak exhibits four distinct phases: initial outbreak, social distancing, social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. An MCMC projection of this latter phase suggests the Israeli epidemic will continue to produce into late November an average of around 1500 new case per day, unless the population practices social-relaxation measures at least 5-fold below the level in August, which itself is 4-fold below the level at the start of July. Our analysis of the relatively late South African outbreak that became the world's fifth largest COVID-19 epidemic in July revealed that the decline through late July and early August was characterised by a social distancing driver operating at more than twice the per-capita applicable-disease-class (pc-adc) rate of the social relaxation driver. Our analysis of the relatively early English outbreak, identified a more than 2-fold improvement in surveillance over the course of the epidemic. It also identified a pc-adc social distancing rate in early August that, though nearly four times the pc-adc social relaxation rate, appeared to barely contain a second wave that would break out if social distancing was further relaxed. Conclusion(s): Our web app provides policy makers and health officers who have no epidemiological modelling or computer coding expertise with an invaluable tool for assessing the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures. This includes an ability to generate an epidemic-suppression or curve-flattening index that measures the intensity with which behavioural responses suppress or flatten the epidemic curve in the region under consideration.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {A simulation model is developed to analyze the spread of covid-19 in universities. The model can be used to conduct a what-if analysis and estimate infection cases under different policies. For proof-of-concept, the model is simulated for a hypothetical university of 25,000 students and 3,000 faculty/staff in a U.S. college town. Simulation results show that early outbreaks are very likely, and there is no silver bullet to avoid them. Instead, a combination of policies should be carefully implemented. The results suggest (almost) full remote university operations from the beginning of the semester. In a less-preferred alternative, if universities decide to have students attend in person, they should encourage remote operations for high-risk individuals, conduct frequent rapid tests, enforce mask use, communicate with students and employees about the risks, and promote social distancing. Universities should be willing to move to remote operations if cases rise. Under this scenario, and considering implementation challenges, many universities are still likely to experience an early outbreak, and the likelihood of having a case of death is worrisome. In the long run, students and faculty react to the risks, and even if universities decide to continue operations, classes are likely to have very low in-person attendance. Overall, our analysis depicts several sources of system complexities, negative unintended consequences of relying on a single policy, non-linear incremental effects, and positive synergies of implementing multiple policies. A simulation platform for a what-if analysis is offered so marginal effectiveness of different policies and different decision-making thresholds for closure can be tested for universities of varying populations.Copyright © 2021 Navid Ghaffarzadegan.

The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in the end of 2019, Wuhan, China, spreads quickly in the world. In this study, an entropy-based thermodynamic model has been used for predicting and spreading the rate of COVID-19. In our model, all the epidemic details were considered into a single time-dependent parameter. The parameter was analytically determined using four constraints, including the existence of an inflexion point and a maximum value. Our model has been layout-based the Shannon entropy and the maximum rate of entropy production of postulated complex system. The results show that our proposed model fits well with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in daily basis. Also, as a matter of fact that Shannon entropy is an intersection of information, probability theory, (non)linear dynamical systems and statistical physics, the proposed model in this study can be further calibrated to fit much better on COVID-19 observational data, using the above formalisms.

   abstract = {The current world observations in COVID-19 are hardly tractable as a whole, making situations of information to be incompleteness. In pandemic era, mathematical modeling helps epidemiological scientists to take informing decisions about pandemic planning and predict the disease behavior in the future. In this work, we proposed a non-extensive entropy-based model on the thermodynamic approach for predicting the dynamics of COVID-19 disease. To do so, the epidemic details were considered into a single and time-dependent coefficients model. Their four constraints, including the existence of a maximum point were determined analytically. The model was worked out to give a log-normal distribution for the spread rate using the Tsallis entropy. The width of the distribution function was characterized by maximizing the rate of entropy production. The model predicted the number of daily cases and daily deaths with a fairly good agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) reported data for world-wide, Iran and China over 2019-2020-time span. The proposed model in this work can be further calibrated to fit on different complex distribution COVID-19 data over different range of times. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Despite the considerable growth of interest in medical tourism in the last decade, there is no standard procedure to measure the pivotal factors in medical tourism destinations. Medical tourism is a rising global phenomenon that is strongly dependent on innovation and knowledge management. Being both innovative and systematic in medical tourism requires thought enrichment in knowledge management in hospitals. By applying a quantitative method, "knowledge management-oriented innovation" items have been used in this study to analyze new products or services related to active hospitals in medical tourism in Iran. This study presents the positive effects of the most essential knowledge management areas such as time, cost, and quality management orientation, on operational performance through the mediating role of innovation speed. In the current study, hospitals of Iran that are active in the medical tourism area have been considered as the final destination. Additionaly, because this study coincides with the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic as the global health crisis which has a considerable effect on medical tourism, the managerial implications have been developed to help managers and decision-makers in order to apply the obtained findings during the pandemic and post-pandemic period.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.},

Estimating the potential maximum hospital capacity for pandemic patient care can aid in assessing regional healthcare capacity during surges in pandemic patient demand, predicting shortfalls, and designing preparedness and response actions. To obtain such estimates and inform action, the program determines a best assignment of a heterogeneous staff of nurses and doctors to key units appropriate for their skills to create the optimal allocation of staffed beds. An alternative trial-and-error approach is offered that decision-makers without optimization or software expertise can use to obtain similar estimates. Under a given assignment of resources, a variety of key performance indicators can be obtained through the direct use of the queueing equations. Results of comparisons to outcomes from a detailed discrete event simulation model of an identical hospital design show the accuracy of the equations to be high despite the added simplifications needed for the use of a closed-form equation-based methodology.Copyright © 2022 "IISE".},

   abstract = {This paper explores the asymmetric effect of COVID-19 pandemic news, as measured by the coronavirus indices (Panic, Hype, Fake News, Sentiment, Infodemic, and Media Coverage), on the cryptocurrency market. Using daily data from January 2020 to September 2021 and the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, the results revealed that both adverse and optimistic news had the same effect on Bitcoin returns, indicating fear of missing out behavior does not prevail. Furthermore, when the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model is estimated, both positive and negative shocks in pandemic indices promote Bitcoin's daily changes; thus, Bitcoin is resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis and may serve as a hedge during market turmoil. The analysis of frequency domain causality supports a unidirectional causality running from the Coronavirus Fake News Index and Sentiment Index to Bitcoin returns, whereas daily fluctuations in the Bitcoin price Granger affect the Coronavirus Panic Index and the Hype Index. These findings may have significant policy implications for investors and governments because they highlight the importance of news during turbulent times. The empirical results indicate that pandemic news could significantly influence Bitcoin's price. Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.},

   abstract = {The assessment of hospitalisations and intensive care is crucial for planning health care resources needed over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonetheless, comparative empirical assessments of COVID-19 hospitalisations and related fatality risk patterns on a large scale are lacking. This paper exploits anonymised, individual-level data on SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections collected and harmonized by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to profile the demographics of COVID-19 hospitalised patients across nine European countries during the first pandemic wave (February - June 2020). We estimate the role of demographic factors for the risk of in-hospital mortality, and present a case study exploring individuals' comorbidities based on a subset of COVID-19 hospitalised patients available from the Dutch health system. We find that hospitalisation rates are highest among individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are not only older than 70 years, but also 50-69 years. The latter group has a longer median time between COVID-19 symptoms' onset and hospitalisation than those aged 70+ years. Men have higher hospitalisation rates than women at all ages, and particularly above age 50. Consistently, men aged 50-59 years have a probability of hospitalisation almost double than women do. Although the gender imbalance in hospitalisation remains above age 70, the gap between men and women narrows at older ages. Comorbidities play a key role in explaining selection effects of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases requiring hospitalisation. Our study contributes to the evaluation of the COVID-19 burden on the demand of health-care during emergency phases. Assessing intensity and timing dimensions of hospital admissions, our findings allow for a better understanding of COVID-19 severe outcomes. Results point to the need of suitable calibrations of epidemiological projections and (re)planning of health services, enhancing preparedness to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)},

Accurate predictions of different factors, like the end date of the pandemic, duration of lockdown and spreading trend can guide us through the pandemic and precautions can be taken accordingly. Multiple attempts have been made to model the virus transmission, but none of them has investigated it at a global level. The novelty of the proposed work lies here. In this paper, first, authors have analysed spreading of the said disease using data collected from various platforms and then, have presented a predictive mathematical model for fifteen countries from first, second and third world for probable future projections of this pandemic.

   title = {Predictive model with analysis of the initial spread of COVID-19 in India},
   journal = {International Journal of Medical Informatics},
   volume = {143},
   pages = {104262},
   abstract = {Objective: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently ravaged through the world, resulting in over thirteen million confirmed cases and over five hundred thousand deaths, a complete change in daily life as we know it, worldwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, as well as heightened hygiene measures and physical distancing. Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. Hence, this article has two fold objectives: (i) conduct an in-depth statistical analysis of COVID-19 affected patients in India, (ii) propose a mathematical model for the prediction of spread of COVID-19 cases in India. Material(s) and Method(s): There has been limited research in modeling and predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India, owing both to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and limited availability of data. Currently famous SIR and non-SIR based Gauss-error-function and Monte Carlo simulation models do not perform well in the context of COVID-19 spread in India. We propose a 'change-factor' or 'rate-of-change' based mathematical model to predict the spread of the pandemic in India, with data drawn from hundreds of sources. Result(s): Average age of affected patients was found to be 38.54 years, with 66.76% males, and 33.24% females. Most patients were in the age range of 18-40 years. Optimal parameter values of the prediction model are identified (alpha = 1.35, N = 3 and T = 10) by extensive experiments. Over the entire course of time since the outbreak started in India, the model has been 90.36% accurate in predicting the total number of cases the next day, correctly predicting the range in 150 out of the 166 days looked at. Conclusion(s): The proposed system showed an accuracy of 90.36% for prediction since the first COVID-19 case in India, and 96.67% accuracy over the month of April. Predicted number of cases for the next day is found to be a function of the numbers over the last 3 days, but with an 'increase' factor influenced by the last 10 days. It is noticed that males are affected more than females. It is also noticed that in India, the number of people in each age bucket is steadily decreasing, with the largest number of adults infected being the youngest ones-a departure from the world trend. The model is self-correcting as it improves its predictions every day, by incorporating the previous day's data into the trend-line for the following days. This model can thus be used dynamically not only to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India, but also to check the effect of various government measures in a short span of time after they are implemented.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Since March, 2020, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) based epidemiological model. The transitions associated with the model is driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people. Considering the probabilistic behavioral aspects associated with mitigation strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic dynamics data for different countries, and point out the reasons behind these contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the contributions of different infection parameters.

The key challenges facing the organizational structure and function of the Greek public health system in order to meet the populations' health needs are discussed. Social distancing, through imposed national lockdown very early in the pandemic, has been a key emergency public health measure that has saved lives. However, the system needs to enhance its capacity, through strengthening primary health and social support care, to be able to meet existing unmet health needs, the impact of the pandemic on mental health, as well as to tackle future new waves of outbreak. The related changes in health service provisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic call for developing new models and novel approaches for delivering effective mental health services.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.},

   abstract = {Objectives To quantify the potential impact of minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol on alcohol consumption, spending and health in South Africa. We provide these estimates disaggregated by different drinker groups and wealth quintiles. Design We developed an epidemiological policy appraisal model to estimate the effects of MUP across sex, drinker groups (moderate, occasional binge, heavy) and wealth quintiles. Stakeholder interviews and workshops informed model development and ensured policy relevance. Setting South African drinking population aged 15+. Participants The population (aged 15+) of South Africa in 2018 stratified by drinking group and wealth quintiles, with a model time horizon of 20 years. Main outcome measures Change in standard drinks (SDs) (12 g of ethanol) consumed, weekly spend on alcohol, annual number of cases and deaths for five alcohol-related health conditions (HIV, intentional injury, road injury, liver cirrhosis and breast cancer), reported by drinker groups and wealth quintile. Results We estimate an MUP of R10 per SD would lead to an immediate reduction in consumption of 4.40% (-0.93 SD/week) and an increase in spend of 18.09%. The absolute reduction is greatest for heavy drinkers (-1.48 SD/week), followed by occasional binge drinkers (-0.41 SD/week) and moderate drinkers (-0.40 SD/week). Over 20 years, we estimate 20 585 fewer deaths and 9 00 332 cases averted across the five health-modelled harms. Poorer drinkers would see greater impacts from the policy (consumption:-7.75% in the poorest quintile,-3.19% in richest quintile). Among the heavy drinkers, 85% of the cases averted and 86% of the lives saved accrue to the bottom three wealth quintiles. Conclusions We estimate that MUP would reduce alcohol consumption in South Africa, improving health outcomes while raising retail and tax revenue. Consumption and harm reductions would be greater in poorer groups.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.},

   abstract = {Background/aims: The Research Topic of Death and Mourning Processes emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and an international group of 12 researchers committed to handling and analyzing the topic from different multidisciplinary perspectives and cultures. Method(s): 174 authors from 22 countries and 5 continents wrote 46 scientific papers, reviewed by 89 peers. Content analysis of the 44 papers that were published in Frontiers in Psychiatry was performed by the editors. Result(s): 9 main topics emerged: 1) Cross-cultural bio-psycho-social perspectives, 2) The role of spirituality, faith and meaning of life, 3) Risk groups, challenges, and controversies in regulations and priorities implemented by governments and policymakers in COVID-19, 4) The secondary impact of COVID-19, 5) Educational needs on death and mourning process 6) Challenges and management of loneliness, palliative care, and dying alone, 7) The impact of death from COVID 19 and the mourning process on front-line professionals and their families, 8) Companions animals, mobile and internet-based interventions, and psychosocial tools to mitigate fear and grief and 9) The psychophysiological stress due to the pandemic situation in the general population. Conclusion(s): Complicated grief in adolescents was underrecognized and misdiagnosed. Mental health professionals and organizations should respond to the bereavement pandemic, and the importance of understanding the complex scenarios of children mourning a parental loss during the COVID-19 pandemic was emphasized. International collaborations showed different ways of seeing and dealing with the death and mourning processes during the pandemic. They highlighted cultural, clinical, and social differences but also a common condition, which is human nature, that has allowed raising our voices as one to express and analyze death and mourning processes from the five continents.},

   journal = {Frontiers in sociology},
   volume = {6},
   pages = {611407},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted maternity care decisions, including plans to change providers or delivery location due to pandemic-related restrictions and fears. A relatively unexplored question, however, is how the pandemic may shape future maternity care preferences post-pandemic. Here, we use data collected from an online convenience survey of 980 women living in the United States to evaluate how and why the pandemic has affected women's future care preferences. We hypothesize that while the majority of women will express a continued interest in hospital birth and OB/GYN care due to perceived safety of medicalized birth, a subset of women will express a new interest in out-of-hospital or "community" care in future pregnancies. However, factors such as local provider and facility availability, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket cost could limit access to such future preferred care options. Among our predominately white, educated, and high-income sample, a total of 58 participants (5.9% of the sample) reported a novel preference for community care during future pregnancies. While the pandemic prompted the exploration of non-hospital options, the reasons women preferred community care were mostly consistent with factors described in pre-pandemic studies, (e.g. a preference for a natural birth model and a desire for more person-centered care). However, a relatively high percentage (34.5%) of participants with novel preference for community care indicated that they expected limitations in their ability to access these services. These findings highlight how the pandemic has potentially influenced maternity care preferences, with implications for how providers and policy makers should anticipate and respond to future care needs.

   pages = {18187},
   abstract = {HIV prevalence in Japan continues to increase among men who have sex with men (MSM). We built a mathematical model to describe the HIV epidemic, including acute infection and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and projected the model to 2050. We compared current testing and treatment policies, a scenario where Japan achieves UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, three PrEP scenarios defined by different coverage levels of 25%, 50%, and 75% among the 20% of MSM with the highest risk behavior, and combinations of these scenarios. With no change in interventions prevalence of HIV among MSM will rise to 9.0% in 2050. If Japan achieves full UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, 84.9% of these infections would be averted. Under 50% PrEP with no expansion of testing and treatment, prevalence will reach 2.6% and 62.1% of infections would be averted by 2050. If in addition UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals are achieved, 92.7% of HIV infections would be prevented by 2050. All interventions tested in this model were cost-saving relative to the base case. Both PrEP and enhanced ART strategies can be cost-saving, and if Japan enhances its testing program for MSM and introduces PrEP, it has the potential to effectively eliminate new infections in the next 30 years.},

   abstract = {Objective: Exclusive breastmilk feeding during the delivery hospitalization, a Joint Commission indicator of perinatal care quality, is associated with longer-term breastfeeding success. Marked racial and ethnic disparities in breastfeeding exclusivity and duration existed prior to COVID-19. The pandemic, accompanied by uncertainty regarding intrapartum and postpartum safety practices, may have influenced disparities in infant feeding practices. Our objective was to examine whether the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City was associated with a change in racial and ethnic disparities in exclusive breastmilk feeding during the delivery stay. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study of electronic medical records from 14,964 births in two New York City hospitals. We conducted a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to compare Black-white, Latina-white, and Asian-white disparities in exclusive breastmilk feeding in a pandemic cohort (April 1-July 31, 2020, n=3122 deliveries) to disparities in a pre-pandemic cohort (January 1, 2019-February 28, 2020, n=11,842). We defined exclusive breastmilk feeding as receipt of only breastmilk during delivery hospitalization, regardless of route of administration. We ascertained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests from nasopharyngeal swab at admission. For each DID model (e.g. Black-white disparity), we used covariate-adjusted log binomial regression models to estimate racial and ethnic risk differences, pandemic versus pre-pandemic cohort risk differences, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Result(s): Exclusive breastmilk feeding increased from pre-pandemic to pandemic among white (40.8% to 46.6%, p<0.001) and Asian (27.9% to 35.8%, p=0.004) women, but not Black (22.6% to 25.3%, p=0.275) or Latina (20.1% to 21.4%, p=0.515) women overall. There was an increase in the Latina-white exclusive breastmilk feeding disparity associated with the pandemic (DID estimator=6.3 fewer cases per 100 births (95% CI=-10.8, -1.9)). We found decreased breastmilk feeding specifically among SARS-CoV-2 positive Latina women (20.1% pre-pandemic vs. 9.1% pandemic p=0.013), and no change in Black-white or Asian-white disparities. Conclusion(s): We observed a pandemic-related increase in the Latina-white disparity in exclusive breastmilk feeding, urging hospital policies and programs to increase equity in breastmilk feeding and perinatal care quality during and beyond this health emergency.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The preparedness of health systems to detect, treat, and prevent onward transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is central to mitigating future outbreaks. Early detection of outbreaks is critical to timely response, but estimating detection rates is difficult because unreported spillover events and outbreaks do not generate data. Using three independent datasets available on the distributions of secondary infections during EVD outbreaks across West Africa, in a single district (Western Area) of Sierra Leone, and in the city of Conakry, Guinea, we simulated realistic outbreak size distributions and compared them to reported outbreak sizes. These three empirical distributions lead to estimates for the proportion of detected spillover events and small outbreaks of 26% (range 8-40%, based on the full outbreak data), 48% (range 39-62%, based on the Sierra Leone data), and 17% (range 11- 24%, based on the Guinea data). We conclude that at least half of all spillover events have failed to be reported since EVD was first recognized. We also estimate the probability of detecting outbreaks of different sizes, which is likely less than 10% for single-case spillover events. Comparing models of the observation process also suggests the probability of detecting an outbreak is not simply the cumulative probability of independently detecting any one individual. Rather, we find that any individual's probability of detection is highly dependent upon the size of the cluster of cases. These findings highlight the importance of primary health care and local case management to detect and contain undetected early stage outbreaks at source.Copyright © 2019 Glennon et al.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To date, there are few longitudinal studies on the COVID-19 pandemic's ongoing impact on youth drinking. This study examines the changes in drinking during two phases of the pandemic in a sample of Canadian youth. Method(s): We used four-year longitudinal data from the COMPASS study, including 14,085 secondary school students from Quebec and Ontario, Canada who provided linked data for any two consecutive years between 2017/18 and 2018/19 (pre-pandemic) waves, and 2019/20 and 2020/21 (during the initial and ongoing pandemic). A difference-in-difference (D-I-D) model was used to compare changes in the frequency of drinking and binge drinking between pre-COVID-19 to initial- and ongoing-pandemic period, while adjusted for age-related effects. Result(s): The expected escalation in the frequency of drinking and binge drinking from the pre-pandemic wave (2018/19) to the initial pandemic (2019/20) was less than the changes seen across the 2017/18 to 2018/19 waves among sex and age groups. However, the second year of COVID was associated with an increase in the frequencies of both drinking and binge drinking. Male and younger students (aged 12-14) differentially increased their consumption. Discussion(s): After a reduction in the initial pandemic period, the frequency of drinking and binge drinking rebounded in the second year, indicating that the pandemic's effects are not singular and have changed over time. Further examination is needed to understand the ongoing effects of the pandemic by continuing to monitor drinking in youth toward informing public health measures and harm reduction strategies.Copyright © 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine},

   abstract = {By early May 2020, the number of new COVID-19 infections started to increase rapidly in Chile, threatening the ability of health services to accommodate all incoming cases. Suddenly, ICU capacity planning became a first-order concern, and the health authorities were in urgent need of tools to estimate the demand for urgent care associated with the pandemic. In this article, we describe the approach we followed to provide such demand forecasts, and we show how the use of analytics can provide relevant support for decision making, even with incomplete data and without enough time to fully explore the numerical properties of all available forecasting methods. The solution combines autoregressive, machine learning and epidemiological models to provide a short-term forecast of ICU utilization at the regional level. These forecasts were made publicly available and were actively used to support capacity planning. Our predictions achieved average forecasting errors of 4% and 9% for one- and two-week horizons, respectively, outperforming several other competing forecasting models.Copyright © 2021 Goic et al.

   abstract = {In project management, agility concept has emerged for overcoming the limitations of traditional methodologies that are sequential and linear. An agile project contains planned processes as well as iterations. In global competitive areas, achieving agility in outsourcing processes enables the companies to cope with changes and dynamic issues. This paper introduces an integrated cognitive map-based intuitionistic fuzzy multiple criteria decision aid to rank agile outsourcing provider alternatives and then determine the best performing one. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are employed for dealing with uncertain and vague data along with the loss of information that may be occurred in numerical operations with fuzzy numbers. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map tool is used to weight the evaluation criteria that are interrelated with each other with causal links. The most appropriate agile outsourcing provider alternative is identified via intuitionistic fuzzy complex proportional assessment technique, which aims to obtain a solution relative to the ideal solution. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy decision aid, a case study is conducted in Turkish white goods industry. As a comparative study, a scenario analysis is provided to understand the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on agile provider evaluation/selection decision. According to the results obtained from the scenario analysis, it is worth noting that home office procedures are appropriate for maintaining agility in outsourcing processes of project management.

   journal = {Health & justice},
   volume = {12},
   number = {1},
   pages = {4},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To promote parent-child reunification, family dependency drug courts (FDDCs) facilitate substance use disorder treatment for people whose children have been removed due to parental substance use. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted FDDC operations, forcing FDDCs to quickly adapt to new circumstances. Although existing research has examined COVID-19 impacts on adult drug courts and civil dependency courts, studies have yet to examine the impact of COVID-19 on FDDCs specifically., METHODS: To explore the impact of COVID-19 on FDDCs, we conducted 20 focus groups and 5 individual interviews with court team members from five Florida FDDCs between 2020 and 2022. Data were analyzed using iterative categorization., RESULTS: Five overarching themes emerged. First, FDDCs adopted virtual technology during the pandemic and more flexible drug screening policies. Second, virtual technology was perceived as improving hearing attendance but decreasing client engagement. FDDC team members discussed a potential hybrid in-person/virtual hearing model after the pandemic. Third, COVID-19 negatively impacted parent-child visitation opportunities, limiting development of bonds between parents and children, and parent-child bonding is a key consideration during judicial reunification decisions. Fourth, COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health of court team members and clients. Court team members adopted new informal roles, such as providing technical support and emotional counseling to clients, in addition to regular responsibilities, resulting in feeling overwhelmed and overworked. Court team members described clients as feeling more depressed and anxious, in part due to limited visitation opportunities with children, which decreased clients' motivation for substance use recovery. Fifth, COVID-19 decreased recruitment of potential clients into FDDCs., CONCLUSIONS: If FDDCs continue to rely on virtual hearings beyond the pandemic, they must develop practices for improving client engagement during virtual hearings. FDDCs should preemptively develop procedures for improving parent-child visitation during future public health crises, because limited visitation opportunities could weaken parent-child bonding and, ultimately, the likelihood of reunification.

   abstract = {Background: We sought to examine the effectiveness of the Enhancing the Quality of Prescribing Practices for Older Adults Discharged from the Emergency Department (EQUiPPED) medication safety program in three emergency departments (EDs) within the largest health system in Rhode Island (RI) with funding through a quality incentive payment by a private insurance partner. Method(s): This study utilized a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design to implement EQUiPPED, a three-prong intervention aimed at reducing potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) prescriptions to 5% or less per month. We included clinicians who prescribed medications to older ED patients during the pre-and post-intervention periods from July 2018 to January 2021. We determined the monthly rate of PIM prescribing among older adults discharged from the ED, according to the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria, using Poisson regression. Result(s): 247 ED clinicians (48% attendings [n = 119], 27% residents [n = 67], 25% advanced practice providers [n = 61]) were included in EQUiPPED, of which 92% prescribed a PIM during the study period. In the pre-implementation period (July 2018-July 2019) the average monthly rate of PIM prescribing was 9.30% (95% CI: 8.82%, 9.78%). In the post-implementation period (October 2019-January 2021) the PIM prescribing rate decreased significantly to 8.62% (95% CI: 8.14%, 9.10%, p < 0.01). During pre-implementation, 1325 of the 14,193 prescribed medications were considered inappropriate, while only 1108 of the 13,213 prescribed medications in post-implementation were considered inappropriate. The greatest reduction was observed among antihistamines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and benzodiazepines. Conclusion(s): EQUiPPED contributed to a modest improvement in PIM prescribing to older adults among clinicians in these RI EDs even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality incentive funding model demonstrates a successful strategy for implementation and, with greater replication, could shape national policy regarding health care delivery and quality of care for older adults.Copyright © 2022 The American Geriatrics Society.},

   abstract = {In times of epidemics and humanitarian crises, it is essential to translate scientific findings into digestible information for government policy makers who have a short time to make critical decisions. To predict how far and fast the disease would spread across Hungary and to support the epidemiological decision-making process, a multidisciplinary research team performed a large amount of scientific data analysis and mathematical and socioeconomic modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hungary, including modeling the medical resources and capacities, the regional differences, gross domestic product loss, the impact of closing and reopening elementary schools, and the optimal nationwide screening strategy for various virus-spreading scenarios and R metrics. KETLAK prepared 2 extensive reports on the problems identified and suggested solutions, and presented these directly to the National Epidemiological Policy-Making Body. The findings provided crucial data for the government to address critical measures regarding health care capacity, decide on restriction maintenance, change the actual testing strategy, and take regional economic, social, and health differences into account. Hungary managed the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic with low mortality rate. In times of epidemics, the formation of multidisciplinary research groups is essential for policy makers. The establishment, research activity, and participation in decision-making of these groups, such as KETLAK, can serve as a model for other countries, researchers, and policy makers not only in managing the challenges of COVID-19, but in future pandemics as well.© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

   abstract = {Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Multi-resistant microorganisms are a public health problem. Their incidence has risen due to COVID-19, indis-criminate antibiotics use, corticosteroid treatments, and higher admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. These are risk factors for bacterial over-infection. The present case study that is relevant because of the multiple isolated strains with a resistance pattern: Klebsiella pneu-moniae carbapenemases (KPC), extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) and New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase (NDM) in a patient without comorbidities. Case Report: A 53-year-old Ecuadorian man with no past medical history arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) with dyspnea, nasopharyngeal swab with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV2, and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showing bilateral ground-glass pulmonary infil-trates with 40% involvement. On day 10 in the ICU, the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC strain was reported in an axillary swab culture. Consequently, the antibiotic was rotated to vancomycin 1 g intravenously (i.v.) every 12 h and meropenem 1 g i.v. every 8 h. On day 15 in the ICU, a tracheal secretion culture was reported with the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL and a blood culture with Klebsiella pneumoniae NDM. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect scenario for superinfection with multi-resistant pathogens such as car-bapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP), due to the increase in patients admitted to ICUs requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, the use of corticosteroids, and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic management based on guidelines. The emergence of combined multidrug-resistant strains is a challenge for laboratory detection and the selection of antimicrobial treatment.Copyright © Am J Case Rep, 2022.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical procedures in Canada were historically funded through global hospital budgets. Activity-based funding models were developed to improve access, equity, timeliness, and value of care for priority areas. COVID-19 upended health priorities and resulted in unprecedented disruptions to surgical care, which created a significant procedure gap. We hypothesized that activity-based funding models influenced the magnitude and trajectory of this procedure gap. METHOD(S): Population-based analysis of procedure rates comparing the pandemic (March 1, 2020-December 31, 2021) to a prepandemic baseline (January 1, 2017-February 29, 2020) in Ontario, Canada. Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to predict expected rates in the pandemic based on the prepandemic baseline. Analyses were stratified by procedure type (outpatient, inpatient), body region, and funding category (activity-based funding programs vs. global budget). RESULT(S): In all, 281,328 fewer scheduled procedures were performed during the COVID-19 period compared with the prepandemic baseline (Rate Ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.77-0.80). Inpatient procedures saw a larger reduction (24.8%) in volume compared with outpatient procedures (20.5%). An increase in the proportion of procedures funded through activity-based programs was seen during the pandemic (52%) relative to the prepandemic baseline (50%). Body systems funded predominantly through global hospital budgets (eg, gynecology, otologic surgery) saw the least months at or above baseline volumes, whereas those with multiple activity-based funding options (eg, musculoskeletal, abdominal) saw the most months at or above baseline volumes. CONCLUSION(S): Those needing procedures funded through global hospital budgets may have been disproportionately disadvantaged by pandemic-related health care disruptions.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

   abstract = {The poultry sector contributes four percent to the national GDP of Nepal. However, this sector is under threat with periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) subtypes H5 and H9 since 2009. This has been both a public health threat and an economic issue. Since the past few years, outbreaks of AI subtype H9 have caused huge economic losses in major poultry producing areas of Nepal. However, the risk factors associated with these outbreaks have not been assessed. A retrospective case-control study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2019 to understand the risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley. Out of 100 farms selected, 50 were "case" farms, confirmed positive to H9 at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Kathmandu, and another 50 farms were "control" farms, matched for farm size and locality within a radius of three km from the case farm. Each farm was visited to collect information using a semi-structured questionnaire. Twelve potential risk factors were included in the questionnaire under the broad categories: Birds and farm characteristics, and management and biosecurity status of the farms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and corresponding odds ratios were calculated. Risk factors, associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley, identified in the final multivariable model were: "farms that have flock size greater than median flock size of study farms (>1500)" (OR = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.53-12.71, p = 0.006), "farms that did not apply rules to wear boots for visitors inside the farms" (OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.52-12.29, p = 0.006) and "other commercial farms located within one km periphery" (OR = 10, 95% CI: 1.8-50, p = 0.007). This study showed that outbreaks of AI subtype H9 in Kathmandu valley were associated with a higher population of birds in the farm, poor management practices, and weak biosecurity measures in poultry farms. We suggest improving management practices and increase biosecurity in the farms to reduce incidences of AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley.Copyright © 2020 Gompo et al.

Based on an emblematic case, this study sought to understand the bioethical challenges of HIV VT prevention in the scope of the Porto Alegre/RS Committee. The analytical categories developed reflect on how the production of care is articulated, on the one hand, with relational discourses and practices based on gender and intersected by race and social class and, on the other, with programmatic vulnerabilities of health policies. A process of extreme stigmatization was revealed, in which the few offers for cisgender women were aimed toward reproductive regulation and perpetuated dynamics of structural violence. We discuss ways of building care that incorporates a decolonial perspective and seeks to produce equity and social justice by recognizing women's trajectories.Copyright © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

   title = {Predicting peak and cumulative ventilator need for COVID-19 in the US: Development of an epidemiological model},
   journal = {American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine},
   volume = {203},
   number = {9},
   abstract = {Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major challenges for healthcare. The availability of mechanical ventilators was particularly problematic early on, with discussion about the appropriateness of invasive mechanical (IMV) vs. non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the management of COVID-19. Various prediction models were developed, but few projected COVID-19-related ventilator use. We aimed to estimate peak and cumulative IMV and NIV need in the US through May 2021. Method(s): We used a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with four additional compartments: exposed (E), in-hospital NIV, in-hospital IMV, and NIV or CPAP (HNIV/CPAP) treated out-of-hospital, based on published ventilator use patterns for COVID-19. Three scenarios (best-, moderate-, and worst-case) were modeled to reflect levels of intervention (e.g., shelter-in-place) effectiveness and compliance. Results included initial peak date, peak ventilator events, ventilator shortfall and timing of subsequent waves. Model performance was compared with estimates of IMV use back-calculated from observed mortality data, assuming a 75% mortality rate for patients on an IMV in the ICU based on published estimates. Result(s): At the start of the pandemic, the US was estimated to have 62,188 full-featured IMV; 22,976 NIV; 88,462 non full-featured devices in hospitals for use as surge devices; plus 12,700 in the Strategic National Stockpile. The moderate-case scenario aligned most closely to back-calculated IMV use based on observed mortality, and suggested that initial peak ventilator need occurred around May 1, 2020, requiring 94,472 inhospital ventilators (40,930 IMV; 53,541 NIV) and 7,931 HNIV/CPAP. In this scenario, the US had sufficient IMV (+21,258) but there may have been a shortfall of 30,565 in-hospital NIV, triggering surge use in some locations. The US is estimated to have 1,915,217 cumulative ventilator use events by May 2021, of which 688,549 are IMV events and 1,226,668 are NIV+HNIV/CPAP events. At least two subsequent waves were estimated to occur prior to May 2021: fall of 2020 and early 2021. Conclusion(s): We estimated the US may need to utilize surge devices to have sufficient in-hospital NIV during peak need periods. Although IMV supplies seem generally adequate, improved strategies to track and share equipment, i.e., move ventilators from centers with surplus to centers in need, should be developed. This model may inform resource planning and allocation for which patients require ventilators in subsequent waves. Further validation will be beneficial using observed data for hospitalization, ventilator utilization and mortality, as well as adjustments for shifting trends in clinical practice such as use of high-flow nasal cannula.},

An integrated health-care system offers advantages in response to the community outbreak and transmission of highly infectious diseases. On the basis of practitioner experience with a pioneering integrated health-care system in Shenzhen, China, this article presents the following effective strategies in response to the epidemic: (1) enhance the public workforce in primary health care; (2) integrate resources to allow regional sharing and efficient use; (3) employ teams centered on general practitioners for community containment; and (4) adopt e-health and telemedicine for health-care delivery. An integrated health-care system is usually very specific to a particular regional context; however, the core strategies and mechanisms based on the Luohu model can contribute to improving the public health capacity in emergency responses; they can transform health-care delivery in the COVID-19 epidemic.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), internet hospitals in China were engaged with epidemic prevention and control, offering epidemic-related online services and medical support to the public. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHOD(S): Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULT(S): A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSION(S): Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.Copyright ©Kai Gong, Zhong Xu, Zhefeng Cai, Yuxiu Chen, Zhanxiang Wang.

   abstract = {Objectives: The internet data is an essential tool for reflecting public attention to hot issues. This study aimed to use the Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) to confirm correlation between COVID-19 case data and Chinese online data (public attention). This could verify the effect of online data on early warning of public health events, which will enable us to respond in a more timely and effective manner. Method(s): Spearman correlation was used to check the consistency of BDI and SMI. Time lag cross-correlation analysis of BDI, SMI and six case-related indicators and multiple linear regression prediction were performed to explore the correlation between public concern and the actual epidemic. Result(s): The public's usage trend of the Baidu search engine and Sina Weibo was consistent during the COVID-19 outbreak. BDI, SMI and COVID-19 indicators had significant advance or lag effects, among which SMI and six indicators all had advance effects while BDI only had advance effects with new confirmed cases and new death cases. But compared with the SMI, the BDI was more closely related to the epidemic severity. Notably, the prediction model constructed by BDI and SMI can well fit new confirmed cases and new death cases. Conclusion(s): The confirmed associations between the public's attention to the outbreak of COVID and the trend of epidemic outbreaks implied valuable insights into effective mechanisms of crisis response. In response to public health emergencies, people can through the information recommendation functions of social media and search engines (such as Weibo hot search and Baidu homepage recommendation) to raise awareness of available disease prevention and treatment, health services, and policy change.Copyright © 2022 Gong, Hou, Han, Liang and Guo.},

   abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of COVID-19 and early government responses to the pandemic in eight South American countries. To this aim, this study explores indicators which trace the progression of the pandemic and analyses factors related of state capacity which impacted on the early response of governments of implementing restrictive policies of social distancing associated with a suppression strategy. The pressure on the health systems is evaluated with early projections of the growth-phase of the epidemic, which is incorporated as an indicator in the analysis of early interventions based on Cox proportional hazards models. The results indicate that fiscal expenditure on health, regional and local government capacity, and pressure on the health system accelerate government response with stringent interventions. A counter-intuitive finding is that the economic strength of a country delays these types of reactions. The effect of these interventions is something that should be studied in greater depth, considering, for example, sociocultural factors. Lastly, only cases such as Uruguay and Paraguay show some signs of having the pandemic relatively under control by mid-May, while Brazil and Peru face very adverse scenarios. In this context, considering the characteristics of the states in the region and the level of informal employment, it will be a public policy challenge to keep the equilibrium between restrictive measures and the economic and social problems which these responses imply in the medium term.

   abstract = {Previous studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on mortality and fertility. However, little is known about the effect of the pandemic on constraining international migration. We use Eurostat and national statistics data on immigration and ARIMA time-series models to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on immigration flows in 15 high-income countries by forecasting their counterfactual levels in 2020, assuming no pandemic, and comparing these estimates with observed immigration counts. We then explore potential driving forces, such as stringency measures and increases in unemployment moderating the extent of immigration change. Our results show that immigration declined in all countries, except in Finland. Yet, significant cross-national variations exist. Australia (60%), Spain (45%) and Sweden (36%) display the largest declines, while immigration decreased by between 15% and 30% in seven countries, and by less than 15% in four nations where results were not statistically significant. International travel restrictions, mobility restrictions and stay-at-home requirements exhibit a relatively strong relationship with declines in immigration, although countries with similar levels of stringency witnessed varying levels of immigration decline. Work and school closings and unemployment show no relationship with changes in immigration.Copyright © 2023 Gonzalez-Leonardo et al.

To deter-mine the prevalence of infection and obtain a range of COVID-19 cases in the main metropolitan zones. Viral RNA residues (0-197,655 copies/L) were measured in wastewater from the five central municipalities in the state. By recording the number of RNA viral copies per liter, micro-basins delimitation, demographic and physiological data, an interval of infected people and virus prevalence was estimated using a Monte Carlo model (with 90% confidence) in the micro-basin of five municipalities with metropolitan influence or industrial activity. Our procedure determined that the percentage of the infected population ranges from 1.4% to 41.7%, while the official data reports 0.1-0.3%.

   abstract = {Importance: Assumption of a well-mixed population during modeling is often erroneously made without due analysis of its validity. Ignoring the importance of the geo-spatial granularity at which the data is collected could have significant implications on the quality of forecasts and the actionable clinical recommendations that are based on it. Objective(s): This paper's primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the characteristic dynamics defining the trajectory of the pandemic in a region is lost when the data is aggregated and modeled at higher geo-spatial levels. Design(s): We use publicly available confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from January 1st, 2020 to August 3rd, 2020 in the United States at different geo-spatial granularities to conduct our experiments. To understand the impact of this hypothesis, the output of this study was implemented in Tampa General Hospital (TGH) to provide resource demand forecast. Result(s): The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the forecast confirmed cases can be 30% higher for modeling at the state-level than aggregating model results at the scale of counties or clusters of counties. Similarly, modeling at a state-level and crafting policy decisions based on them may not be effective - county-level forecasts made by partitioning state-level forecasts are 3x worse for confirmed cases and 20x worse for deaths relative to the same model at the county level. By leveraging these results, TGH was able to accurately allocate clinical resources to tackle COVID-19 cases, continue elective surgical procedures largely uninterrupted and avoid costly construction of overflow capacity in the first two epidemic waves. Conclusions and Relevance: Accurate forecasting at the county level requires hyper-local modeling with county resolution. State-level modeling does not accurately predict community spread in smaller sub-regions because state populations are not well mixed, resulting in large prediction errors. Actionable decisions such as deciding whether to cancel planned surgeries or construct overflow capacity require models with local specificity.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging the planet, but its (short-, medium-, and long-term) diverse effects on health, economy, and society are far from being understood. This article investigates the potential impact of a deadly epidemic and its main nonpharmaceutical control interventions (social distancing vs. testing-tracing-isolation, TTI) on capital accumulation and economic development at different time scales. This is done by integrating an epidemiological susceptible-infectious-recovered model with a Solow-type growth model including public expenditure, as a parsimonious setting to offer insights on the trade-off between protecting human lives and the economy and society. The work clarifies (i) the long-term interactions amongst a deadly infection, demography, and capital accumulation, (ii) the lack of viability of persistent social distancing measures also using an analytical characterization, and the threat of policy-enhanced COVID-19 endemicity, (iii) the potentially high return on investments in TTI activities to avoid future lockdowns and related capital disruption. It also quantifies the welfare effects of a range of policies, confirming a counterintuitive role for tax-funded preventive investments aimed at strengthening TTI as more desirable interventions than generalized lockdowns.

   journal = {Advances in respiratory medicine},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To facilitate rapid and effective diagnosis of COVID-19, effective screening can alleviate the challenges facing healthcare systems. We aimed to develop a machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and design a graphical user interface (GUI) to diagnose COVID-19 cases by recording their symptoms and demographic features. METHOD(S): We implemented different classification models including support vector machine (SVM), Decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the result of COVID-19 test for individuals. We trained these models by data of 16973 individuals (90% of all individuals included in data gathering) and tested by 1885 individuals (10% of all individuals). Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) algorithms used to score features for prediction of result of COVID-19 test. A user-friendly GUI was designed to predict COVID-19 test results in individuals. RESULT(S): Study results revealed that coughing had the highest positive correlation with the positive results of COVID-19 test followed by the duration of having COVID-19 signs and symptoms, exposure to infected individuals, age, muscle pain, recent infection by COVID-19 virus, fever, respiratory distress, loss of smell or taste, nausea, anorexia, headache, vertigo, CT symptoms in lung scans, diabetes and hypertension. The values of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity and area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) of different classification models computed in different setting of features scored by MRMR algorithm. Finally, our designed GUI by receiving each of the 42 features and symptoms from the users and through selecting one of the SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes and decision tree models, predict the result of COVID-19 test. The accuracy, AUROC and F1-score of SVM model as the best model for diagnosis of COVID-19 test were 0.7048 (95% CI: 0.6998, 0.7094), 0.7045 (95% CI: 0.7003, 0.7104) and 0.7157 (95% CI: 0.7043, 0.7194), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In this study we implemented a machine learning approach to facilitate early clinical decision making during COVID-19 outbreak and provide a predictive model of COVID-19 diagnosis capable of categorizing populations in to infected and non-infected individuals the same as an efficient screening tool.},

   abstract = {Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations can provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policies. We devised a compartmental model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies with a main focus on mass testing. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries, and the number of COVID-19-inflicted deaths. We assumed that COVID-19 survivors are immune (e.g., mutations are not considered) and that the virus is primarily passed on by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. The model parameters have been chosen in a plausible range based on information found in the literature, but it is easily adaptable, i.e., these values can be replaced by updated information any time. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in different scenarios. Social distancing or mass testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared with a situation without mitigation. We found that mass testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. It is of high practical relevance that a relationship between testing frequency and the effective reproduction number of the virus can be provided. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economic costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we quantify the theoretical limit of contact tracing and by how much the effect of testing is enhanced, if applied to sub-populations with increased exposure risk or prevalence.Copyright © 2020 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

   abstract = {COVID-19 classified under emerging infectious diseases has spread across the world resulting in many casualties. India reported its first case on 30th January 2020 and has completed 100 days in this pandemic period. The government of India has issued stringent guidelines and imposed a lockdown for long periods to ensure the practising of social distancing. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends in the confirmed cases of India in comparison with the other prominent countries around the globe. A novel approach using a sigmoid function to predict and forecast the trends for cases in India are also presented in this work. By placing the current time on the sigmoid curve, forecasting the total number of confirmed cases by the end of the pandemic is made. If proper measures and stringent guidelines are not followed, India may have to endure a total confirmed case of up to 4.4 lakh. The prediction also suggests that 99.9% of the pandemic may end in India by 27th July 2020. The best possible approach is to undertake preventive measures by strictly adhering to the guidelines and policies set by the government. Performing hand hygiene, practicing social distancing, surveillance and isolation is the only means to break the chain of transmission and control the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Introduction In 2009 and 2010, Athens, Greece experienced a hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) outbreak among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), respectively. The HCV outbreak was not detected, while that of HIV was identified in 2011. The integrated HIV-interventions, launched in early 2012, managed to reduce directly the HIV incidence and indirectly the HCV incidence. This study aims to assess what would have been the course of the HIV outbreak and its associated economic consequences if the 2009 HCV outbreak had been detected and integrated interventions had been initiated 1- or 2-years earlier. Methods The model was calibrated to reproduce the observed HIV epidemiological and clinical parameters among PWID of Athens, Greece. We examined the effect of the 1- or 2-years earlier detection scenarios, the 1-year later detection, the non-detection scenario, and compared them to the status quo scenario. Results Cumulative HIV cases, under the status-quo scenario during 2009-2019, were 1360 (90% Credible intervals: 290, 2470). If the HCV outbreak had been detected 1- or 2- years earlier, with immediate initiation of integrated interventions, 740 and 1110 HIV cases could be averted by 2019, respectively. Regarding the costs, if there was an efficient notification system to detect the HCV outbreak 1 or 2 years earlier, 35.2-53.2 million euros could be saved compared to the status quo by 2019. Conclusions If the HCV outbreak had been detected and promptly addressed, the HIV outbreak would have been prevented and 35.2-53.2 million euros could have been saved.Copyright © 2021 Gountas et al.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyprus addressed the first wave of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The aims of this study were: a) to estimate epidemiological parameters of this wave including infection attack ratio, infection fatality ratio, and case ascertainment ratio, b) to assess the impact of public health interventions and examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented. METHOD(S): A dynamic, stochastic, individual-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression in the population of the Republic of Cyprus. The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use. RESULT(S): By May 8th, 2020, the infection attack ratio was 0.31% (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: 0.15, 0.54%), the infection fatality ratio was 0.71% (95% CrI: 0.44, 1.61%), and the case ascertainment ratio was 33.2% (95% CrI: 19.7, 68.7%). If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths. If Cyprus had only increased ICU beds, without any social distancing measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 19th. CONCLUSION(S): The decision of the Cypriot authorities to launch early NPIs limited the burden of the first wave of COVID-19. The findings of these analyses could help address the next waves of COVID-19 in Cyprus and other similar settings.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {People who inject drugs (PWID) comprise one of the major transmission risk groups for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In 2011, Athens experienced a large HIV outbreak among PWID. Significant public health interventions were implemented in response to the HIV outbreak. The aims of this study were to estimate the indirect effects of the HIV interventions on HCV infection and to evaluate the concept of the association between HCV and HIV infections in the case of Athens. A dynamic, stochastic, individual-based model was developed to simulate HCV transmission among PWID. We calibrated the model to reproduce the observed HCV prevalence among PWID in Greece. Two years prior to the HIV outbreak, an undetected HCV outbreak has occurred. In 2009, the incidence of HCV infection increased from 640 (495, 842) cases in 2008 to 1260 (1060, 1500). The mean time from initiation of injecting drug use to HCV acquisition decreased from 29 months in 2008 to 13 months in 2009. After HIV interventions, HCV incidence declined by 64.8% in 2012, compared to 2009. The averted HCV incidence cases attributed to the HIV-implemented interventions were 2200 (1950, 2480), during 2012-2015. The cumulative number incident HCV cases in Athens during 2002-2015 was about 9900 (7800, 12 100). Our results highlight that before the 2011 HIV outbreak in Athens, an HCV outbreak occurred in 2009. Prevention measures for HIV that took place in the Athens metropolitan area in 2012 reduced significantly the incidence of HCV.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

   abstract = {Sharing individual-level pandemic data is essential for accelerating the understanding of a disease. For example, COVID-19 data have been widely collected to support public health surveillance and research. In the United States, these data are typically de-identified before publication to protect the privacy of the corresponding individuals. However, current data publishing approaches for this type of data, such as those adopted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have not flexed over time to account for the dynamic nature of infection rates. Thus, the policies generated by these strategies have the potential to both raise privacy risks or overprotect the data and impair the data utility (or usability). To optimize the tradeoff between privacy risk and data utility, we introduce a game theoretic model that adaptively generates policies for the publication of individual-level COVID-19 data according to infection dynamics. We model the data publishing process as a two-player Stackelberg game between a data publisher and a data recipient and then search for the best strategy for the publisher. In this game, we consider 1) average performance of predicting future case counts; and 2) mutual information between the original data and the released data. We use COVID-19 case data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center from March 2020 to December 2021 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model. The results indicate that the game theoretic model outperforms all state-of-the-art baseline approaches, including those adopted by CDC, while maintaining low privacy risk. We further perform an extensive sensitivity analyses to show that our findings are robust to order-of-magnitude parameter fluctuations.},

   abstract = {Disturbingly realistic triage scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity for studying discrimination in moral reasoning. Biases and favoritism do not need to be explicit and overt, but can remain implicit and covert. In addition to assessing laypeople's propensity for engaging in overt discrimination, the present study examines whether they reveal implicit biases through seemingly fair random allocations. We present a cross-sectional online study comprising 6 timepoints and a total of 2296 participants. Each individual evaluated 19 hypothetical scenarios that provide an allocation dilemma between two patients who are in need of ventilation and differ only in one focal feature. Participants could either allocate the last ventilator to a patient, or opt for random allocation to express impartiality. Overall, participants exhibited clear biases for the patient who was expected to be favored based on health factors, previous ethical or caretaking behaviors, and in-group favoritism. If one patient had been pre-allocated care, a higher probability of keeping the ventilator for the favored patient indicates persistent favoritism. Surprisingly, the absence of an asymmetry in random allocations indicates the absence of covert discrimination. Our results demonstrate that laypeople's hypothetical triage decisions discriminate overtly and show explicit biases.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).},

   volume = {16},

   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of citizens' behaviors in the containment of the virus. Individuals might change their intention to adhere to public health prescriptions depending on various personal characteristics, including their own emotional status, which has been recognized to be a crucial psychological factor in orienting people's adherence to public health recommendation during emergency settings. In particular, it is crucial to support citizens' alliance with authorities and feeling of trust: public engagement is a concept that refers to the general involvement of citizens into public affairs which is generally considered an effective approach to enhance citizens' understanding of their crucial role in public affairs. However, so far there is no agreement on the metrics and indexes that should be used to measures public engagement during a health crisis. The aim of this paper is to validate a psychometric scale (PHEs-E), which intends to measure the readiness of individuals to adhere to the prescribed behavioral change to contain the emergency. Data were collected throughout the pandemic in Italy: in particular, five independent samples were recruited starting from March 2020 to March 2021. Results showed that the proposed measure has good psychometric characteristics. A general linear model was computed to assess the differences of public engagement across the different data points and among citizens with different sociodemographic characteristics. Correlations with other psychological constructs (i.e. Anxiety, Depression and Self-Efficacy) were also tested, showing that more engaged citizens have a lower level of anxiety and depression, and a higher self-efficacy. This study's findings indicate that individuals' characteristics may differentiate citizens' motivation to engage in public health behavioral recommendation to prevent the COVID-19 contagion. However the scale could be useful to perform a psychological monitoring of psychological readiness to engage in public health strategies to face critical events and settings.},

Method(s): Individual-based and compartment models were used to simulate the effects of different social distancing and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. These models were used to evaluate the effects of different social distancing levels and the early relaxation of suppression measures, in terms of public health and economy outcomes. Result(s): The models, fitted to observations up to July 2020, yielded projections consistent with subsequent cases and showed that better public health outcomes and lower economy costs occur when social distancing measures are more stringent, implemented earlier and implemented for a sufficiently long duration. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs. Conclusion(s): Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

Method(s): We collect data obtained from four rounds of a national sample of 5,000 US survey respondents in each round from April 2020 to February 2021. Using logistic regression and fixed effects models, we estimate the pandemic impacts on COVID-19 related concerns, social distancing behaviors, and mental health/life satisfaction and optimism for racial/income groups. Result(s): Despite extreme income and health disparities before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, Blacks and Hispanics remain more resilient and optimistic than their White counterparts. Moreover, the greatest difference in resilience, optimism and better mental health-is found between poor Blacks and poor Whites, a difference that persists through all four rounds. Conclusion(s): These deep differences in resilience have implications for the long-term mental health of different population groups in the face of an unprecedented pandemic. Better understanding these dynamics may provide lessons on how to preserve mental health in the face of public health and other large-scale crises.Copyright © 2022 Graham et al.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine the moderating effect of burnout on the relationship between nurses' competence, professional competence and professional values. BACKGROUND: There is a preponderance of burnout studies of nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about burnout's moderating influence on nurses' professionalism, competence and values during the ongoing pandemic. METHOD(S): This study used a correlational, cross-sectional design and convenience sampling to recruit 809 Saudi nurses employed in four government hospitals. Four self-report instruments were used to collect data from August 2021 to March 2022. Spearman Rho, structural equation modelling and multi-group moderation analysis were used to analyse the data. RESULT(S): Most of the participants had high burnout. There was a moderate to high correlation between the dimensions of professional competence, nurse professional values, burnout and nurse competence. Both professional competence and nurse professional values significantly affected nurse competence. Nurse professional values also had a direct effect on professional competence. Professional competence and nurse professional values on nurse competence may vary among those with low, moderate and high levels of burnout, suggesting the moderating effect of burnout. CONCLUSION(S): The positive impacts of nurse professional values and professional competence on nursing competence were validated in this study, as was the evidence of burnout's moderating effect on the studied connections. To avoid burnout, it is necessary to increase organizational knowledge and support for nurses, their working conditions and the environment through strategies that promote well-being and empowerment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers can implement policies to help nurses minimize burnout and improve their professional values and competence. Management policies may be considered include increased staffing, opportunities to improve technical abilities through education and vocational training programs, and increased diversity of job assignments.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyse the effect of a pandemic shock on the well-being of the European population aged 50 or over. Data comes from wave 7 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), carried out in 28 countries and representing over 170 million aged individuals in Europe. We start by designing two indicators in order to capture the risk of being unhealthy and economically vulnerable; next, we combine them with socio-demographic information and obtain the vulnerability profiles by means of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm. Subsequently, we design a shock similar to the COVID-19 pandemic and measure its effects on the vulnerability profiles. The results suggest that the average level of economic and health vulnerability is relatively low, although levels differ across European regions, with the most vulnerable being Eastern European countries. It was observed that the shock most affected countries with a greater proportion of individuals initially deemed vulnerable in terms of mental and physical health, as well as countries where tourism and retail sectors are the most vital for their economies. These findings led us to conclude that public policies should be differentiated by European regions, and Governments must establish action plans in order to better meet the physical and mental health needs of their citizens, as well as addressing monetary poverty and financial difficulties.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models can be powerful policymaking tools. Simple, static models are user-friendly for policymakers. More complex, dynamic models account for time-dependent changes but are complicated to understand and produce. Under which conditions are static models adequate? We compare static and dynamic model predictions of whether behavioural disinhibition could undermine the impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provision to female sex workers in South Africa. METHOD(S): A static model of HIV risk was developed and adapted into a dynamic model. Both models were used to estimate the possible reduction in condom use, following PrEP introduction, without increasing HIV risk. The results were compared over a 20-year time horizon, in two contexts: at epidemic equilibrium and during an increasing epidemic. RESULT(S): Over time horizons of up to 5 years, the models are consistent. Over longer timeframes, the static model overstates the tolerated reduction in condom use where initial condom use is reasonably high ($\ge$50%) and/or PrEP effectiveness is low ($\le$45%), especially during an increasing epidemic. CONCLUSION(S): Static models can provide useful deductions to guide policymaking around the introduction of a new HIV intervention over short-medium time horizons of up to 5 years. Over longer timeframes, static models may not sufficiently emphasise situations of programmatic importance, especially where underlying epidemics are still increasing.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

   abstract = {The mechanisms of the connections among anxiety, mental healthcare needs, and adherence to the COVID-19 pandemic guidelines are unknown. The study aims to explore model assumptions: (H1) Anxiety about COVID-19 will influence the perception of mental health needs via knowledge about COVID-19 as a mediator. (H2) Anxiety will influence adherence to guidelines via knowledge about COVID-19 as a mediator. (H3) Trust in health care will positively influence adherence to guidelines. We conducted a cross-sectional design study with a convenience sample. Participants consisted of 547 people across Israel. The questionnaire included trust in health care, anxiety, knowledge, adherence to guidelines, and mental health care needs regarding COVID-19 variables. Path analysis revealed knowledge about COVID-19 as partly mediating anxiety and mental healthcare needs during the pandemic, as well as partly mediating anxiety and adherence to the pandemic guidelines. Moreover, we found that trust in healthcare affects adherence to the pandemic guidelines. Therefore, it is important to design an intervention program for the public providing accessible, reliable information about the pandemic, including, and emphasizing mental healthcare needs and rationale of adherence to the guidelines.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowcasting approaches enhance the utility of reportable disease data for trend monitoring by correcting for delays, but implementation details affect accuracy. OBJECTIVE(S): To support real-time COVID-19 situational awareness, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used nowcasting to account for testing and reporting delays. We conducted an evaluation to determine which implementation details would yield the most accurate estimated case counts. METHOD(S): A time-correlated Bayesian approach called Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS) was applied in real time to line lists of reportable disease surveillance data, accounting for the delay from diagnosis to reporting and the shape of the epidemic curve. We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for confirmed case counts among residents diagnosed during the period from March to May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. RESULT(S): Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days when the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2914. CONCLUSION(S): Nowcasting using NobBS can effectively support COVID-19 trend monitoring. Accounting for overdispersion, shortening the moving window, and suppressing diagnoses on weekends-when fewer patients submitted specimens for testing-improved the accuracy of estimated case counts. Nowcasting ensured that recent decreases in observed case counts were not overinterpreted as true declines and supported officials in anticipating the magnitude and timing of hospitalizations and deaths and allocating resources geographically.Copyright ©Sharon K Greene, Sarah F McGough, Gretchen M Culp, Laura E Graf, Marc Lipsitch, Nicolas A Menzies, Rebecca Kahn.

   abstract = {Older adults have higher sedentary behavior (SB), lower physical activity, and are particularly susceptible to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions. Pandemic impacts to SB and health, particularly via objective assessment, are not well documented in the literature. Here we described differences in SB, physical activity, and blood pressure (BP) for older adults before and during the pandemic. Baseline thigh-worn activPAL accelerometer and BP measurements from 95 participants enrolled in a SB intervention trial pre-pandemic were compared to 60 enrolled post-pandemic. We used linear regression models adjusted for demographic and health factors to estimate differences in sample means of SB measures and BP. The post-COVID sample was older (age 67 vs. 70), more female (60% vs. 72%), and included more individuals of color (21% vs. 32%). In fully adjusted models, systolic BP was statistically significantly higher in the post-COVID group (6.8, 95% CI: [0.3,13.3]). After adjustment, activPAL-measured and self-reported activity were non-significant but trended towards greater total sitting (0.4 hours [-0.3, 1.1]), fewer daily steps (-270 [-1078, 538]), and greater self-reported TV time (0.4 hours, [-0.3, 1.1]) post-COVID. Future analyses are warranted to better quantify these impacts and guide clinical care and future interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer screenings in the U.S. by decreasing screening numbers.We believe multiple types of cancer screenings may have been impacted during the pandemic as a result of cancellations of elective procedures and patient fear of seeking cancer screenings during a pandemic and that Google Trends may be a marker to estimate screening usage. Method(s): Google Trends (trends.google.com) was utilized to assess public interest in multiple cancer types. We then constructed a forecasting model to determine the expected search interest had the pandemic not occurred. We then compared our models to actual screening usage during the pandemic. Result(s): Public interest in cancer screenings decreased precipitously at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the Google Trends estimated the decrease in mammogram usage 25.8% below the actual value. Similarly, Google Trends estimated the decrease in colon cancer screening usage 9.7% below the true value. Discussion(s): We found the decrease in public interest in breast and colon cancer screenings slightly underestimated the actual screening usage numbers, suggesting Google Trends may be utilized as an indicator for human behavior regarding cancer screening, particularly with colon and breast cancer screenings. If the negative trend in cancer screening continues and missed screenings are not appropriately corrected for, socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer diagnoses, morbidity, and mortality will widen.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a Pandemic Risk Exposure Measurement (PREM) model to determine the factors that affect a country's prospective vulnerability to a pandemic risk exposure also considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): To develop the model, drew up an inventory of possible factor variables that might expose a country's vulnerability to a pandemic such as COVID-19. This model was based on the analysis of existing literature and consultations with some experts and associa-tions. To support the inventory of selected possible factor variables, we have conducted a survey with participants sampled from people working in a risk management environment carrying out a risk management function. The data were subjected to statistical analysis, specifically exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach Alpha to determine and group these factor variables and determine their reliability, respectively. This enabled the development of the PREM model. To eliminate possible bias, hierarchical regression analysis was carried out to examine the effect of the "Level of Experienced Hazard of the Participant (LEH)" considering also the "Level of Expertise and Knowledge about Risk and Risk Management (LEK)". Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis loaded best on four factors from 19 variables: Demographic Features, Country's Activity Features, Economic Exposure and Societal Vulnerability (i.e. the PREM Model). This model explains 65.5% of the variance in the level of experienced hazard (LEH). Additionally, we determined that LEK explains only about 2% of the variance in LEH. Conclusion(s): The developed PREM model shows that monitoring of Demographic Features, Country's Activity Features, Economic Exposure and Societal Vulnerability can help a country to identify the possible impact of pandemic risk exposure and develop policies, strategies, regulations, etc., to help a country strengthen its capacity to meet the economic, social and in turn healthcare demands due to pandemic hazards such as COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Grima et al.},

   journal = {Risk Management and Healthcare Policy},
   volume = {14},
   pages = {4775-4787},
   abstract = {Purpose: To statistically validate the PREM (Pandemic Risk Exposure Measurement) model devised in a previous paper by the authors and determine the model's relationship with the level of current COVID-19 cases (NLCC) and the level of current deaths related to COVID-19 (NLCD) based on the real country data. Method(s): We used perceived variables proposed in a previous study by the same lead authors and applied the latest available real data values for 154 countries. Two endogenous real data variables (NLCC) and (NLCD) were added. Data were transformed to measurable values using a Likert scale of 1 to 5. The resulting data for each variable were entered into SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 26 and Amos (Analysis of a Moment Structures) version 21 and subjected to statistical analysis, specifically exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis. Result(s): The results obtained confirmed a 4-factor structure and that the PREM model using real data is statistically reliable and valid. However, the variable Q14 - hospital beds available per capita (1000 inhabitants) had to be excluded from the analysis because it loaded under more than one factor and the difference between the factor common variance was less than 0.10. Moreover, its Factor 1 and Factor 3 with NLCC and Factor 1 with NLCD showed a statistically significant relationship. Conclusion(s): Therefore, the developed PREM model moves from a perception-based model to reality. By proposing a model that allows governments and policymakers to take a proactive approach, the negative impact of a pandemic on the functioning of a country can be reduced. The PREM model is useful for decision-makers to know what factors make the country more vulnerable to a pandemic and, if possible, to manage or set tolerances as part of a preventive measure.Copyright © 2021 Grima et al. php and incorporate t.},

   volume = {19},

   abstract = {The reopening of child-care programs during COVID-19 demanded comprehensive preventive measures. Research to date has overlooked this reopening process as well as early childhood professionals' (ECPs) implementation efforts and resulting changes in their work practices and well-being. As a result, this study sought insights into (1) the practical implementation of measures, (2) perceptions and evaluations of measures, (3) changes in work characteristics, and (4) its impact on well-being. Qualitative interviews were conducted with German child-care managers (N = 27) between June and August 2020. The semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and content-analyzed using MAXQDA. ECPs, through a combination of high effort and engagement, ensured the feasibility of most preventive measures. This included practices which were perceived to be unreasonable or ones which were stricter than practices required for the public. This exacerbated the critical work characteristics (e.g., high workload, overtime, and multitasking) from pre-pandemic scenarios and led to new work demands (e.g., changes in work content and social interactions). ECPs maintained intensive work demands and consequently suffered from broad strain outcomes (e.g., worry, exhaustion, anger, fear of infection, and reduced psychological sense of community). This study highlights the adverse psychosocial work environment of ECPs despite the necessity of ensuring health and safety at work.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important role not only for the baseline infection rate, but also for short and long-term reactions to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.Copyright: © 2021 Gros et al.

   abstract = {The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with the problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies, balancing public health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing measures. We introduce a modified epidemic model that we name the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the first peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of containment strategies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic. Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on current case numbers lead to substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the overall history of the epidemic.},

   pages = {e0250050},
   abstract = {In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and to guide policy-making. Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population's heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population's heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.Copyright © 2021 Grosmann et al.

We aimed to explore levels of care burden, loneliness, and social isolation among caregivers of people with enduring physical and brain health conditions in English-speaking regions worldwide, by investigating outcomes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): A cross-sectional anonymous online survey data from 2287 English-speaking caregivers of people with long term health conditions from four English-speaking regions (UK, Ireland, USA, New Zealand) included measures of care burden, loneliness, and social isolation, reported before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were descriptive, followed by an ordinal regression model for predictors of burden. Result(s): Compared to pre-pandemic levels, all caregivers experienced a significant increase in burden, loneliness, and isolation. Caregivers of people with both brain health and physical conditions were the most burdened and had the highest levels of loneliness and isolation compared to caregivers of people with either a brain health or physical condition only. The increase in care burden among caregivers of people with brain health challenges was associated with caregiver's gender, moderate and severe emotional loneliness, magnitude and frequency of isolation during the pandemic, and care circumstances (cohabitation with the care recipient, restrictions on the ability to provide care). Conclusion(s): Health and social care interventions should target caregivers' care circumstances and psychological outcomes, particularly in women, accounting for the significant additional burden of care, loneliness, and isolation resulting from pandemic-related restrictions.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {In their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, governments face the dilemma to balance public health and economy. Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travellers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g. around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data are available.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.},

   abstract = {This article devises a photograph-based monitoring model to estimate the real-time PM2.5 concentrations, overcoming currently popular electrochemical sensor-based PM2.5 monitoring methods' shortcomings such as low-density spatial distribution and time delay. Combining the proposed monitoring model, the photographs taken by various camera devices (e.g., surveillance camera, automobile data recorder, and mobile phone) can widely monitor PM2.5 concentration in megacities. This is beneficial to offering helpful decision-making information for atmospheric forecast and control, thus reducing the epidemic of COVID-19. To specify, the proposed model fuses Information Abundance measurement and Wide and Deep learning, dubbed as IAWD, for PM2.5 monitoring. First, our model extracts two categories of features in a newly proposed DS transform space to measure the information abundance (IA) of a given photograph since the growth of PM2.5 concentration decreases its IA. Second, to simultaneously possess the advantages of memorization and generalization, a new wide and deep neural network is devised to learn a nonlinear mapping between the above-mentioned extracted features and the groundtruth PM2.5 concentration. Experiments on two recently established datasets totally including more than 100 000 photographs demonstrate the effectiveness of our extracted features and the superiority of our proposed IAWD model as compared to state-of-the-art relevant computing techniques.},

   abstract = {It is long perceived that the more data collection, the more knowledge emerges about the real disease progression. During emergencies like the H1N1 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemics, public health surveillance requested increased testing to address the exacerbated demand. However, it is currently unknown how accurately surveillance portrays disease progression through incidence and confirmed case trends. State surveillance, unlike commercial testing, can process specimens based on the upcoming demand (e.g., with testing restrictions). Hence, proper assessment of accuracy may lead to improvements for a robust infrastructure. Using the H1N1 pandemic experience, we developed a simulation that models the true unobserved influenza incidence trend in the State of Michigan, as well as trends observed at different data collection points of the surveillance system. We calculated the growth rate, or speed at which each trend increases during the pandemic growth phase, and we performed statistical experiments to assess the biases (or differences) between growth rates of unobserved and observed trends. We highlight the following results: 1) emergency-driven high-risk perception increases reporting, which leads to reduction of biases in the growth rates; 2) the best predicted growth rates are those estimated from the trend of specimens submitted to the surveillance point that receives reports from a variety of health care providers; and 3) under several criteria to queue specimens for viral subtyping with limited capacity, the best-performing criterion was to queue first-come, first-serve restricted to specimens with higher hospitalization risk. Under this criterion, the lab released capacity to subtype specimens for each day in the trend, which reduced the growth rate bias the most compared to other queuing criteria. Future research should investigate additional restrictions to the queue.},

   abstract = {Background: Cruise travel contributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission when there were relatively few cases in the United States. By 14 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending US cruise operations; the last US passenger ship docked on 16 April. Method(s): We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in US waters or carrying US citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of 4 interventions (screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms; viral testing on 2 days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and reducing port visits to 1) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. Result(s): During 19 January to 16 April 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1669 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.17, P < .003). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43.3% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80.1%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020. Despite all interventions modeled, cruise travel still poses a significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.Copyright © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.},

   abstract = {Countries have sought to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by severely restricting travel and in-person commercial activities. Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.},

   abstract = {Purpose of Review: This review points out unmet medical needs and open research questions of older adults living with HIV. Starting from the definition of aging in HIV, it explores the mosaic of this condition at epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical level. Antiretroviral management and diverse models of care are critically discussed. Recent Findings: Aging cohorts suggest HIV as a paradigm of chronic inflammation and immune activation with specific aging trajectory patterns in which antiretroviral therapy may play a role. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, observational cohorts show that therapy is driven by duration of HIV infection and burden of non-infectious comorbidities. Summary: This review suggests that geriatric approach should be used to recognize the complexity of aging goes beyond the viro-immunological success and management of progressive accumulation of non-communicable diseases. This requires recognition of frailty and geriatric syndromes to stratify patients' diversity by using comprehensive geriatric assessment tools.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

   volume = {12},
   number = {1},
   pages = {20220117},
   abstract = {Objective: COVID-19 data released by public health authorities is subject to inherent time delays. Such delays have many causes, including delays in data reporting and the natural incubation period of the disease. We develop and introduce a numerical procedure to recover the distribution of these delays from data. Method(s): We extend a previously-introduced compartmental model with a nonlinear, distributed-delay term with a general distribution, obtaining an integrodifferential equation. We show this model can be approximated by a weighted-sum of constant time-delay terms, yielding a linear problem for the distribution weights. Standard optimization can then be used to recover the weights, approximating the distribution of the time delays. We demonstrate the viability of the approach against data from Italy and Austria. Result(s): We find that the delay-distributions for both Italy and Austria follow a Gaussian-like profile, with a mean of around 11 to 14 days. However, we note that the delay does not appear constant across all data types, with infection, recovery, and mortality data showing slightly different trends, suggesting the presence of independent delays in each of these processes. We also found that the recovered delay-distribution is not sensitive to the discretization resolution. Conclusion(s): These results establish the validity of the introduced procedure for the identification of time-delays in COVID-19 data. Our methods are not limited to COVID-19, and may be applied to other types of epidemiological data, or indeed any dynamical system with time-delay effects.Copyright © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

To perform the field assessment, a checklist developed by the CDC (Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Tool for Nursing Homes Preparing for COVID-19) and adapted to the Italian context was used. Fourteen facilities took part in the survey (87.5%). The application of good practices for each survey area was expressed as a percentage with the following median values: restriction policies (87.5%), staff training (53.8%), resident training (67.6%), availability of personal protective equipment (41.7%), infection control practices (73.5%) and communication (80%). Among the facilities, considerable variability was observed in these evaluation fields: only the restriction policies and communication activities were applied uniformly. A discrepancy was found between perceived risk and real danger in the facilities, requiring targeted communication actions. At present, it is necessary to promote a new approach based on the prediction of critical events, thereby providing the means to effectively address them.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Temperature and relative humidity are major factors determining virus inactivation in the environment. This article reviews inactivation data regarding coronaviruses on surfaces and in liquids from published studies and develops secondary models to predict coronaviruses inactivation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A total of 102 D values (i.e., the time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global data set of D values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points, or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. IMPORTANCE The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential in investigating the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. A calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.

   abstract = {Finite-time stability analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the long-term behavior of epidemiological models and has been widely used to study the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we present a finite-time stability analysis of a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic compartmental model with switching signals. The model includes a linear parameter variation (LPV) and switching system that represents the impact of external factors, such as changes in public health policies or seasonal variations, on the transmission rate of the disease. We use the Lyapunov stability theory to examine the long-term behavior of the model and determine conditions under which the disease is likely to die out or persist in the population. By taking advantage of the average dwell time method and Lyapunov functional (LF) method, and using novel inequality techniques the finite-time stability (FTS) criterion in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is developed. The finite-time stability of the resultant closed-loop system, with interval and linear parameter variation (LPV), is then guaranteed by state feedback controllers. By analyzing the modified SIR model with these interventions, we are able to examine the efficiency of different control measures and determine the most appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested strategy through simulation results.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background. This study examined the epidemiological correlations between secretory otitis media (SOM) and diseases of neighboring organs. We measured changes in disease incidences during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic using Internet big data spanning from 2011 to 2021. Methods. This study used the Baidu Index (BI) to determine the search volume for the terms ''secretory otitis media (SOM)'', ''tonsillitis'', ''pharyngolaryngitis'', ''adenoid hypertrophy (AH)'', ''nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)'', ''nasal septum deviation (NSD)'', ''rhinosinusitis'', ''allergic rhinitis (AR)'', and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)'' in Mandarin from January 2011 to December 2021. The correlations between these terms were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results were compared search data from 2019 and 2021 to assess the effects of isolation on SOM in 2020. Results. The seasonal variations trends of SOM and other diseases coincided well (P < 0.05), except for AR. During the 11-year timeframe, the monthly searches for rhinosinusitis, NSD, tonsillitis, pharyngolaryngitis, and NPC were statistically correlated with SOM (R = 0.825, 0.594, 0.650, 0.636, 0.664, respectively; P < 0.05). No correlation was found between SOM and AR, SOM and AH, or SOM and GERD (R = -0.028, R = 0.259, R = 0.014, respectively, P > 0.05). The total search volumes for SOM, rhinosinusitis, NPC, and AH decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. Discussion. SOM exhibited a discernible epidemiological connection with rhinosinusitis, nasal septal deviation (NSD), tonsillitis, pharyngolaryngitis, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A decrease in public gatherings was observed to effectively reduce the incidences of SOM. This underscores the pivotal role of social measures in influencing the prevalence of SOM and emphasizes the intricate interplay between SOM and various associated health factors, with implications for public health strategies.Copyright 2024 Guo et al.},

The findings reveal that the small-world pattern and scale-free property of media citation networks contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19-related news around the world. Within the networks, a small number of media outlets from a few countries formed the backbone of the network to control the risk communication; meanwhile, many media of geographical and cultural similarities formed cross-border collaborative cliques in the periphery of the network. When the alert phase escalated from the national level to the global level, the network demonstrated a number of changes. The findings contribute to the understanding of risk communication for international public health emergencies by taking into account the network perspective and evolutionary nature of public health emergencies in analysis.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

Social distancing, mask wearing and contact tracing have contributed to containing or at least mitigating the outbreak, but how public awareness influences the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches remains unclear.

The targeted model is parameterized based on multi-source data, including the cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered individuals, the daily number of media-reporting items and the imported cases from the rest of China outside Shaanxi from January 23 to April 11, 2020. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of media reporting and imported cases on transmission. The results revealed that reducing the intensity of media reporting, which would result in a significant increasing of the contact rate and a sizable decreasing of the contact-tracing rate, could aggravate the outbreak severity by increasing the cumulative number of confirmed cases. It also demonstrated that diminishing the imported cases could alleviate the outbreak severity by reducing the length of the epidemic and the final size of the confirmed cases; conversely, delaying implementation of lockdown strategies could prolong the length of the epidemic and magnify the final size. These findings suggest that strengthening media coverage and timely implementing of lockdown measures can significantly reduce infection.},

   abstract = {Background: The postponement of the Hangzhou Asian Games has reignited controversy over whether it is necessary and safe to hold. This study aimed to assess its necessity for Asian elite sport and the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic through joint data science research on elite sports and public health Internet big data., Methods: For necessity, we used seven pre-pandemic Asian Games to investigate its long-term internal balance and six pre-pandemic Olympic Games to examine its contribution to the external competitiveness of Asian sport powers through bivariate Pearson correlation analyses between sport variables and holding year. For challenges, we used Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data and Tokyo 2020 Olympic data to quantify the past impact of the pandemic on elite sport by another correlation analysis between pandemic variables and the change in the weighted score of medal share (CWSMS), built a transferable linear regression model, transferred the model to Jakarta 2018 Asian Games data, and eventually forecasted the possible impact of the pandemic on the results of the Hangzhou Asian Games., Results: The proportion of gold medal countries in the Asian Games showed a long-term upward trend (Pearson r (7) = 0.849, p < 0.05), and the share of medals won by Asian countries showed a significant increasing process (Pearson r (6) = 0.901, p < 0.05). The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths (CND) was most significantly correlated to CWSMS (Pearson r (100) = -0.455, p < 0.001). The total Olympic model output of Asian countries was 0.0115 in Tokyo 2020 and is predicted to be 0.0093 now. The prediction of CWSMS in Hangzhou was 0.0013 for China, 0.0006 for Japan, and 0.0008 for South Korea., Conclusion: We documented that Asian Games played a significant role in the long-term balanced internal structure and the increasing global competitiveness of Asian elite sport. We proved that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the Olympic performance of countries worldwide, while the competitive performance at the Hangzhou Games would be less affected than the world average level. This study also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary data science research on large-scale sports events and public health. Copyright © 2022 Guo, Zhang and Cui.},

   volume = {16},

   abstract = {The entire world has suffered a lot since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, so simulation models of COVID-19 dynamics are urgently needed to understand and control the pandemic better. Meanwhile, emotional contagion, the spread of vigilance or panic, serves as a negative feedback to the epidemic, but few existing models take it into consideration. In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there weren't emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK. Due to the experiment results, the proposed multi-layer network model with hybrid simulation is valid and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of the epidemic trends and the suppression effect of emotional contagion in different countries. Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics.},

   abstract = {Although novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was widely spread in mainland China in early 2020, it was soon controlled. To study the impact of government interventions on the spread of disease during epidemics, a differential equation system is established to simulate the process of virus propagation in this paper. We first analyze its basic properties, basic reproduction number R0 and existence of equilibria. Then we prove that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable when R0 is less than 1. Through the analysis of the daily epidemic data from January 10, 2020 to March 11, 2020, combined with the implementation of the national epidemic policy, we divide the whole process into three stages: the first stage (natural state), the second stage (isolation state), the third stage (isolation, detection and treatment). By using the weighted nonlinear least square method to fit the data of three stages, the parameters are obtained, and three basic reproduction numbers are calculated, which are: R01 = 2.6735 , R02 = 0.85077 , R03 = 0.18249 . Sensitivity analysis of threshold parameters and corresponding graphical results were also performed to examine the relative importance of various model parameters to the spread and prevalence of COVID-19. Finally, we simulate the trend of three stages and verify the theory of Global Asymptotic Stability of DFE. The conclusion of this paper proves theoretically that the Chinese government's epidemic prevention measures are effective in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. This study can not only provide a reference for research methods to simulate COVID-19 transmission in other countries or regions, but also provide recommendations on COVID-19 prevention measures for them.

   abstract = {Timely detection of an evolving event of an infectious disease with superspreading potential is imperative for territory-wide disease control as well as preventing future outbreaks. While the reproduction number (R) is a commonly-adopted metric for disease transmissibility, the transmission heterogeneity quantified by dispersion parameter k, a metric for superspreading potential is seldom tracked. In this study, we developed an estimation framework to track the time-varying risk of superspreading events (SSEs) and demonstrated the method using the three epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Epidemiological contact tracing data of the confirmed COVID-19 cases from 23 January 2020 to 30 September 2021 were obtained. By applying branching process models, we jointly estimated the time-varying R and k. Individual-based outbreak simulations were conducted to compare the time-varying assessment of the superspreading potential with the typical non-time-varying estimate of k over a period of time. We found that the COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong exhibited substantial superspreading during the initial phase of the epidemics, with only 1 % (95 % Credible interval [CrI]: 0.6-2 %), 5 % (95 % CrI: 3-7 %) and 10 % (95 % CrI: 8-14 %) of the most infectious cases generated 80 % of all transmission for the first, second and third epidemic waves, respectively. After implementing local public health interventions, R estimates dropped gradually and k estimates increased thereby reducing the risk of SSEs to approaching zero. Outbreak simulations indicated that the non-time-varying estimate of k may overlook the possibility of large outbreaks. Hence, an estimation of the time-varying k as a compliment of R as a monitoring of both disease transmissibility and superspreading potential, particularly when public health interventions were relaxed is crucial for minimizing the risk of future outbreaks.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed public health policies and human and community behaviors through lockdowns and mandates. Governments are rapidly evolving policies to increase hospital capacity and supply personal protective equipment and other equipment to mitigate disease spread in affected regions. Current models that predict COVID-19 case counts and spread are complex by nature and offer limited explainability and generalizability. This has highlighted the need for accurate and robust outbreak prediction models that balance model parsimony and performance. Objective(s): We sought to leverage readily accessible data sets extracted from multiple states to train and evaluate a parsimonious predictive model capable of identifying county-level risk of COVID-19 outbreaks on a day-to-day basis. Method(s): Our modeling approach leveraged the following data inputs: COVID-19 case counts per county per day and county populations. We developed an outbreak gold standard across California, Indiana, and Iowa. The model utilized a per capita running 7-day sum of the case counts per county per day and the mean cumulative case count to develop baseline values. The model was trained with data recorded between March 1 and August 31, 2020, and tested on data recorded between September 1 and October 31, 2020. Result(s): The model reported sensitivities of 81%, 92%, and 90% for California, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively. The precision in each state was above 85% while specificity and accuracy scores were generally >95%. Conclusion(s): Our parsimonious model provides a generalizable and simple alternative approach to outbreak prediction. This methodology can be applied to diverse regions to help state officials and hospitals with resource allocation and to guide risk management, community education, and mitigation strategies.Copyright © Agrayan K Gupta, Shaun J Grannis, Suranga N Kasthurirathne.

   abstract = {Virus diseases are a continued threat to human health in both community and healthcare settings. The current virus disease COVID-19 outbreak raises an unparalleled public health issue for the world at large. Wuhan is the city in China from where this virus came first and, after some time the whole world was affected by this severe disease. It is a challenge for every country's people and higher authorities to fight with this battle due to the insufficient number of resources. On-going assessment of the epidemiological features and future impacts of the COVID-19 disease is required to stay up-to-date of any changes to its spread dynamics and foresee needed resources and consequences in different aspects as social or economic ones. This paper proposes a prediction model of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19. The model is based on a deep learning algorithm with two long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. We consider the available infection cases of COVID-19 in India from January 22, 2020, till October 9, 2020, and parameterize the model. The proposed model is an inference to obtain predicted coronavirus cases and deaths for the next 30 days, taking the data of the previous 260 days of duration of the pandemic. The proposed deep learning model has been compared with other popular prediction methods (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest) showing a lower normalized RMSE. This work also compares COVID-19 with other previous diseases (SARS, MERS, h1n1, Ebola, and 2019-nCoV). Based on the mortality rate and virus spread, this study concludes that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is more dangerous than other diseases. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) has long been recognized for its high-quality clinical practice guidelines. Over the years, as recommended methods for guideline production have evolved, the CTS guideline process has become more rigorous and lengthier. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this model was challenged by the urgent need for guidance, insufficient time for conventional guideline processes, and shrinking human resources and capacity. Accordingly, the CTS pivoted from guidelines to the more rapid, narrative, and informal "position statement" format. Having produced 17 COVID-related statements, the CTS saw its guideline website visits increase by 90% and downloads by 63% in 2020 versus 2019. However, providing rapid guidance in the form of position statements necessitates a significant tradeoff in the rigor of methodological processes used to arrive at recommendations. Previous research suggests that robust "rapid guidelines" may be feasible through modifications to conventional guideline development processes. Such approaches were successfully implemented by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the World Health Organization, and the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for COVID-19-related guidelines. Rapid guidelines have been made more feasible by better information sharing and advancing technologies such as an online COVID network meta-analysis engine and an app that allows organizations to author, publish and update digital guidelines. The CTS must continue to produce urgent guidance for decision makers, providers and the public alike in the context of this pandemic and should explore opportunities to espouse a standardized, rigorous and transparent process for rapid guidelines.Copyright © 2021 Canadian Thoracic Society.},

   abstract = {Importance: After abrupt closures of businesses and public gatherings in the US in late spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, by mid-May 2020, most states reopened their economies. Owing in part to a lack of earlier data, there was little evidence on whether state reopening policies influenced important pandemic outcomes-COVID-19-related hospitalizations and mortality-to guide future decision-making in the remainder of this and future pandemics. Objective(s): To investigate changes in COVID-19-related hospitalizations and mortality trends after reopening of US state economies. Design Setting and Participants: Using an interrupted time series approach, this cross-sectional study examined trends in per-capita COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths before and after state reopenings between April 16 and July 31, 2020. Daily state-level data from the University of Minnesota COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project on COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths across 47 states were used in the analysis. Exposures: Dates that states reopened their economies. Main Outcomes and Measures: State-day observations of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and COVID-19-related new deaths per 100000 people. Result(s): The study included 3686 state-day observations of hospitalizations and 3945 state-day observations of deaths. On the day of reopening, the mean number of hospitalizations per 100000 people was 17.69 (95% CI, 12.54-22.84) and the mean number of daily new deaths per 100000 people was 0.395 (95% CI, 0.255-0.536). Both outcomes displayed flat trends before reopening, but they started trending upward thereafter. Relative to the hospitalizations trend in the period before state reopenings, the postperiod trend was higher by 1.607 per 100000 people (95% CI, 0.203-3.011; P=.03). This estimate implied that nationwide reopenings were associated with 5319 additional people hospitalized for COVID-19 each day. The trend in new deaths after reopening was also positive (0.0376 per 100000 people; 95% CI, 0.0038-0.0715; P=.03), but the change in mortality trend was not significant (0.0443; 95% CI, -0.0048 to 0.0933; P=.08). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study conducted over a 3.5-month period across 47 US states, data on the association of hospitalizations and mortality with state reopening policies may provide input to state projections of the pandemic as policy makers continue to balance public health protections with sustaining economic activity.Copyright 2021 Gupta S et al.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic by the World Health Organization. It started in China in December 2019, and it rapidly spread throughout Italy, which was the most affected country after China. The pandemic affected all countries with similarly negative effects on the population and health care structures., OBJECTIVE: The evolution of the COVID-19 infections and the way such a phenomenon can be characterized in terms of resources and planning has to be considered. One of the most critical resources has been intensive care units (ICUs) with respect to the infection trend and critical hospitalization., METHODS: We propose a model to estimate the needed number of places in ICUs during the most acute phase of the infection. We also define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future management of patients with COVID-19 by planning their reallocation in health structures of other regions., RESULTS: We applied and assessed the prediction method both at the national and regional levels. ICU bed prediction was tested with respect to real data provided by the Italian government. We showed that our model is able to predict, with a reliable error in terms of resource complexity, estimation parameters used in health care structures. In addition, the proposed method is scalable at different geographic levels. This is relevant for pandemics such as COVID-19, which has shown different case incidences even among northern and southern Italian regions., CONCLUSIONS: Our contribution can be useful for decision makers to plan resources to guarantee patient management, but it can also be considered as a reference model for potential upcoming waves of COVID-19 and similar emergency situations.

   title = {Notional Spread of Cholera in Haiti Following a Natural Disaster: Considerations for Military and Disaster Relief Personnel},
   journal = {Military medicine},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cholera remains a significant public health threat for many countries, and the severity largely varies by the population and local conditions that drive disease spread, especially in endemic areas prone to natural disasters and flooding. Epidemiological models can provide useful information to military planners for understanding disease spread within populations and the effectiveness of response options for preventing the transmission among deployed and stationed personnel. This study demonstrates the use of epidemiological modeling to understand the dynamics of cholera transmission to inform emergency planning and military preparedness in areas with highly communicable diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areas with higher probability for a potential cholera outbreak in Haiti followed by a natural disaster were identified. The hotspots were then used to seed an extended compartmental model, EpiGrid, to simulate notional spread scenarios of cholera originating in three distinct areas in Haiti. Disease parameters were derived from the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, and disease spread was simulated over a 12-week period under uncontrolled and controlled spread. RESULT(S): For each model location, scenarios of mitigated (intervention with 30% transmission reduction via international aid) and unmitigated (without intervention) are simulated. The results depict the geographical spread and estimate the cumulative cholera infection for each notional scenario over the course of 3months. Disease transmission differs considerably across origin site with an outbreak originating in the department of Nippes spanning the largest geographic area and resulting in the largest number of cumulative cases after 12weeks under unmitigated (79,518 cases) and mitigated (35,667 cases) spread scenarios. CONCLUSION(S): We modeled the notional re-emergence and spread of cholera following the August 2021 earthquake in Haiti while in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This information can help guide military and emergency response decision-making during an infectious disease outbreak and considerations for protecting military personnel in the midst of a humanitarian response. Military planners should consider the use of epidemiological models to assess the health risk posed to deployed and stationed personnel in high-risk areas.Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2022.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seen infectious disease modelling at the forefront of government decision-making. Models have been widely used throughout the pandemic to estimate pathogen spread and explore the potential impact of different intervention strategies. Infectious disease modellers and policymakers have worked effectively together, but there are many avenues for progress on this interface. In this paper, we identify and discuss seven broad challenges on the interaction of models and policy for pandemic control. We then conclude with suggestions and recommendations for the future.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {By any standard, the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic has been abysmal, with countless unnecessary deaths and suffering. Although the human impact is most important, the pandemic has also had enormous consequences on the U.S. political system. Health policy and politics scholars, particularly from political science orientations, are ideally equipped to evaluate the pandemic response from a political perspective. In this study, we report on the results of a two-wave survey of academic health policy researchers in April/May (N = 239) and September (N = 158) 2020. Respondents noted an outsized influence of public health, medicine, and economics, while noting limited public engagement of social scientists like sociologists and political scientists. The perceived expert influence declined over the two waves, while assessment of electoral consequences to favor Democrats grew. Respondents also offered a sober perspective on federal and state responses to the pandemic, forecasting lasting implications for health policy and political dynamics for years to come. Given their expertise, health policy and politics scholars appear uniquely qualified to enter the public and policy discourse going forward.Copyright © 2020 Policy Studies Organization},

   abstract = {The global economy has experienced a tremendous shock caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on the normal activities of SMEs, which provide essential driving economic force. Considering that there is currently no precise prediction about the end of this pandemic, many SMEs must make critical decisions about whether to remain in the market during the pandemic or to leave it, investing their assets in a more secure sector of the economy. However, in order to convince SMEs to remain in the market, thus maintaining the damaged economy, governments may variously apply punitive or supportive measures. In this regard, the interaction between SMEs strategies and government measures can be considered as an evolutionary game, in which the governments impose various policies after observing the evolutionary behaviors of SMEs. An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is derived through a replicator dynamic system, and the available payoff of each player is calculated by Nash equilibrium (NA). Finally, a numerical example is presented, and related managerial insights are proposed at the end of the current study. For instance, contrary to general belief, it can be inferred from investigating possible scenarios that punitive policies are more effective than supportive measures in convincing SMEs to remain in the market.

   abstract = {Voluntary isolation is one of the most effective methods for individuals to help prevent the transmission of diseases such as COVID-19. Understanding why people leave their homes when advised not to do so and identifying what contextual factors predict this non-compliant behavior is essential for policymakers and public health officials. To provide insight on these factors, we collected data from 42,169 individuals across 16 countries. Participants responded to items inquiring about their socio-cultural environment, such as the adherence of fellow citizens, as well as their mental states, such as their level of loneliness and boredom. We trained random forest models to predict whether someone had left their home during a one week period during which they were asked to voluntarily isolate themselves. The analyses indicated that overall, an increase in the feeling of being caged leads to an increased probability of leaving home. In addition, an increased feeling of responsibility and an increased fear of getting infected decreased the probability of leaving home. The models predicted compliance behavior with between 54% and 91% accuracy within each country's sample. In addition, we modeled factors leading to risky behavior in the pandemic context. We observed an increased probability of visiting risky places as both the anticipated number of people and the importance of the activity increased. Conversely, the probability of visiting risky places increased as the perceived putative effectiveness of social distancing decreased. The variance explained in our models predicting risk ranged from < .01 to .54 by country. Together, our findings can inform behavioral interventions to increase adherence to lockdown recommendations in pandemic conditions.Copyright: © 2022 Hajdu et al.

   abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the integration of the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of intention to plan preventive behavior for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Method(s): In a cross-sectional study, a sample of 480 adult participants from different outpatient clinics were recruited in the study. The participant responded by self-report; the health belief model (HBM) scale, preventive behavior scale, subjective norms scale, the intention of planned behavior scale, and perceived control behavior scale were measured. The hypothesized causal path models were examined using SEM analysis. Result(s): The HBM had significant effects on perceived behavior control (beta=0.60, P=0.001), the intended preventive behavior (beta=0.32, P=0.001), and subjective norm (beta=0.53, P=0.001). Subsequently, the intention of preventive behavior (beta==0.39, P=0.001) and subjective norms (beta=0.27, P=0.001) significantly affected the performance of preventive behaviors. The estimated fitting criteria showed that the hypothesized model fits relatively well. Conclusion(s): The health belief model with the integration of subjective norms, perceived control behavior and mediation by the intention of planned behavior in a pathway relationship explains well the preventive behavior of COVID-19. The findings present a deeper understanding of how integrating HBM and intended planned behavior enhances people's preventive behavior against COVID-19.Copyright © 2024 Babol University of Medical Sciences.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has fundamentally changed the way we live and work forever. The business sector is forecasting and formulating different scenarios associated with the impact of the pandemic on its employees, customers, and suppliers. Various business retrieval models are under construction to cope with life after the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis. However, the proposed plans and scenarios are static and cannot address the dynamic pandemic changes worldwide. They also have not considered the peripheral in-between scenarios to propel the shifting paradigm of businesses from the existing condition to the new one. Furthermore, the scenario drivers in the current studies are generally centered on the economic aspects of the pandemic with little attention to the social facets. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing scenario planning and analytics to study the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on large-scale information technology-led Companies. The primary and peripheral scenarios are constructed based on a balanced set of business continuity and employee health drivers. Practical action plans are formulated for each scenario to devise plausible responses. Finally, a damage management framework is developed to cope with the mental disorders of the employees amid the disease.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

Informed by studies of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, retention, and promotion, we model the potential impact of PrEP use among at-risk adolescent sexual minority males. Method(s): We simulate an HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 13-39. We assume adult MSM ages 19-39 have had PrEP available for 3 years with 20% coverage among eligible MSM based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. PrEP interventions for ages 16-18 are then simulated using adherence and retention profiles drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies across a range of uptake parameters (10%-100%). Partnerships across age groups were modeled using parameterizations from the RADAR study. We compare the percent of incident infections averted (impact), person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence over 10 years. Result(s): As compared to no PrEP use, baseline PrEP adherence and retention among adolescent sexual minority males drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies averted from 2.8% to 41.0% of HIV infections depending on the fraction of eligible adolescent sexual minority males that initiated PrEP at their annual health-care visit. Improved adherence and retention achieved with an array of focused interventions from real-world settings increased the percent of infections averted by as much as 26%-70%. Conclusion(s): Empirically demonstrated improvements in the PrEP continuum of care in response to existing interventions can substantially reduce incident HIV infections among adolescent sexual minority males.Copyright © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine},

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. Method(s): Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities and age profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-y (2020) interruption or a 2-y (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. Result(s): Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19's impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM). Conclusion(s): Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- A nd long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.Copyright © 2021 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

   pages = {1698},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the ongoing epidemics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have affected the mortality trend of the nation, the national level assessment of excess mortality (changes in overall mortality in the entire population) is still scarce in Korea. Therefore, this study evaluated the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea using the certified mortality data. METHOD(S): Monthly mortality and population data from January 2013 to June 2022 was obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database and Statistics Korea. A quasi-Poisson interrupted time-series model adjusted for age structure, population, seasonality, and long-term trends was used to estimate the counterfactual projections (expected) of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to June 2022). The absolute difference (observed-expected) and ratio (observed / expected) of mortality were calculated. Stratified analysis based on pandemic years (years 2020, 2021, and 2022), sex, and age groups (aged 0-4, 5-19, 20-64, and>=65 years) were conducted. RESULT(S): An 8.7% increase in mortality was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic [absolute difference: 61,277 persons; ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.087 (1.066, 1.107)]. The gap between observed and estimated mortality became wider with continuation of the pandemic [ratio (95% CI), year 2020: 1.021 (1.003, 1.040); year 2021: 1.060 (1.039, 1.080), year 2022: 1.244 (1.219, 1.270)]. Although excess mortality across sex was similar, the adult [aged 20-64, ratio (95% CI): 1.059 (1.043, 1.076)] and elderly [aged 65-, ratio (95% CI): 1.098 (1.062, 1.135)] population showed increased excess mortality during the pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Despite Korea's successful quarantine policy response, the continued epidemic has led to an excess mortality. The estimated mortality exceeded the number of deaths from COVID-19 infection. Excess mortality should be monitored to estimate the overall impact of the pandemic on a nation.Copyright © 2023.

   number = {2},
   pages = {1169-1185},
   abstract = {Recurrent outbreaks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in many countries around the world. We developed a twofold framework in this study, which is composed by one novel descriptive model to depict the recurrent global outbreaks of COVID-19 and one dynamic model to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of recurrent outbreaks. We used publicly available data of cumulative infected cases from 1 January 2020 to 2 January 2021 in 30 provinces in China and 43 other countries around the world for model validation and further analyses. These time series data could be well fitted by the new descriptive model. Through this quantitative approach, we discovered two main mechanisms that strongly correlate with the extent of the recurrent outbreak: the sudden increase in cases imported from overseas and the relaxation of local government epidemic prevention policies. The compartmental dynamical model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Dead and Recovered (SEIDR) Model) could reproduce the obvious recurrent outbreak of the epidemics and showed that both imported infected cases and the relaxation of government policies have a causal effect on the emergence of a new wave of outbreak, along with variations in the temperature index. Meanwhile, recurrent outbreaks affect consumer confidence and have a significant influence on GDP. These results support the necessity of policies such as travel bans, testing of people upon entry, and consistency of government prevention and control policies in avoiding future waves of epidemics and protecting economy.

   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {12},
   pages = {779594},
   abstract = {Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic experienced by the international community has increased the usage frequency of borderless, highly personalized social media platforms of all age groups. Analyzing and modeling texts sent through social media online can reveal the characteristics of the psychological dynamic state and living conditions of social media users during the pandemic more extensively and comprehensively. This study selects the Sina Weibo platform, which is highly popular in China and analyzes the subjective well-being (SWB) of Weibo users during the COVID-19 pandemic in combination with the machine learning classification algorithm. The study first invokes the SWB classification model to classify the SWB level of original texts released by 1,322 Weibo active users during the COVID-19 pandemic and then combines the latent growth curve model (LGCM) and the latent growth mixture model (LGMM) to investigate the developmental trend and heterogeneity characteristics of the SWB of Weibo users after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results present a downward trend and then an upward trend of the SWB of Weibo users during the pandemic as a whole. There was a significant correlation between the initial state and the development rate of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). LGMM results show that there were two heterogeneous classes of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the development rate of the SWB of the two classes was significantly different. The larger class (normal growth group; n = 1,229, 93.7%) showed a slow growth, while the smaller class (high growth group; n = 93, 6.3%) showed a rapid growth. Furthermore, the slope means across the two classes were significantly different (p < 0.001). Therefore, the individuals with a higher growth rate of SWB exhibited stronger adaptability to the changes in their living environments. These results could help to formulate effective interventions on the mental health level of the public after the public health emergency outbreak.

   abstract = {The prevention and control measures adopted by various countries have different effects in the face of COVID-19. The performance in some socialist countries and capitalist countries were compared from three aspects, including the proportion of confirmed cases and deaths to the national population, economic recovery and production and living, social satisfaction and international evaluation. The overall performance of listed socialist countries was better than that of capitalist countries. China's performance, forming a unique Chinese model of the epidemic prevention and control, was better than that of other socialist countries. The successful experience of Chinese model can be mainly reflected in four aspects, including resource allocation, social participation, speed and quality, system and mechanism optimization. The successful experience roots in the four institutional advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), coordinated national response, basic economic system and traditional Chinese culture. In the future, Chinese government should adhere to the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and improve the public health and emergency management system. Chinese government should accelerate the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. These findings are of great significance in understanding China's prevention and control measures, the institutional advantages and subsequent optimization.

   abstract = {Aim: The outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) was initiated in December 2019, and within a couple of months it became a global health emergency. Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. Subject and methods: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Result(s): Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion(s): In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   volume = {39},

   pages = {3-17},
   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated both positive and negative effects on the environment. Major concerns over personal hygiene, mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations. Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be imagined and acted upon.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.},

   abstract = {This study proposes a novel typology of adaptation to hazards-a conversion strategy as a countermeasure to manage risks in interconnected supply chains. Conversion strategies are intended to transform one or multiple supply chain functions for a different one to manage the changing environment. Supply chain disruptions due to natural hazards have been researched in key manufacturing-based economies like Thailand, the US, Japan, and China. Limited studies, however, have looked at the nature of interconnected risks and its effective countermeasures that arise when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt supply chains. Here, we examine systemic risks by contrasting supply chain disruptions caused by natural hazards and the pandemic. Our study investigates whether businesses can manage systemic risks brought on by the pandemic by learning from dealing with disruptions caused by natural hazards. We offer a typology of conversion strategies to demonstrate how conversion strategies can be a successful response to pandemic scenarios. Specifically, we propose six conversion types: production location, production line, storage, usage, distributional channel, and workforce skill set. Then, we conclude with the future research directions as well as the kinds of policy supports required to assist businesses in implementing conversion measures by drawing on prior work addressing natural hazards.

   journal = {Journal of international migration and integration},
   pages = {1-19},
   abstract = {Canada's migration management has been evolving into a two-step model since the 1990s, creating pathways for temporary residents to apply for permanent status through federal and provincial programs. The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it unprecedented challenges but also holds the potential to be a key policy moment to re-imagine Canada's migration future. In this paper, we draw on semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 16 Chinese temporary residents, to reveal some of the successes, opportunities, as well as challenges, limitations, and conspicuous cracks in these new policies intended to maintain high levels of immigration during the pandemic and through Canada's post-pandemic recovery. We review some of the recent pandemic-related policy measures that strengthen Canada's current two-step migration model, which created more opportunities for temporary residents within Canadian borders to transition to permanent resident status, while restricting the eligibility of overseas applicants. The lived experiences of Chinese temporary residents can provide useful lessons as Canada determines which pandemic measures to make permanent.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and its profound global effects may be changing the way we think about illness. In summer 2020, 120 American adults were asked to diagnose symptoms of COVID-19, a cold, and cancer, and to answer questions related to the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, time-course, and transmission of each disease. Results showed that participants were more likely to correctly diagnose COVID-19 (91% accuracy) compared to a cold (58% accuracy) or cancer (52% accuracy). We also found that 7% of participants misdiagnosed cold symptoms as COVID-19, and, interestingly, over twice as many participants (16%) misdiagnosed symptoms of cancer as COVID-19. Our findings suggest a distinct mental model for COVID-19 compared to other illnesses. Further, the prevalence of COVID-19 in everyday discourse-especially early in the pandemic-may lead to biased responding, similar to errors in medical diagnosis that result from physicians' expertise. We also discuss how the focus of public-health messaging on prevention of COVID-19 might contribute to participants' mental models.},

   abstract = {Early estimates of the transmission properties of a newly emerged pathogen are critical to an effective public health response, and are often based on limited outbreak data. Here, we use simulations to investigate how correlations between the viral load of cases in transmission chains can affect estimates of these fundamental transmission properties. Our computational model simulates a disease transmission mechanism in which the viral load of the infector at the time of transmission influences the infectiousness of the infectee. These correlations in transmission pairs produce a population-level convergence process during which the distributions of initial viral loads in each subsequent generation converge to a steady state. We find that outbreaks arising from index cases with low initial viral loads give rise to early estimates of transmission properties that could be misleading. These findings demonstrate the potential for transmission mechanisms to affect estimates of the transmission properties of newly emerged viruses in ways that could be operationally significant to a public health response.},

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty, with dire mortality predictions from early forecasts resulting in widespread government intervention and greater individual precaution that reduced the projected death toll. We analyze how life insurance companies changed pricing and offerings in response to COVID-19 using monthly data on term life insurance policies from Compulife. We estimate event-study models that exploit well-established variation in the COVID-19 mortality rate based on age and underlying health status. Despite the increase in mortality risk and significant uncertainty, the results generally indicate that life insurance companies did not increase premiums or decrease policy offerings due to COVID-19. Nonetheless, we find some evidence that premiums differentially increased for individuals with very high risk and that some policies were removed for the oldest of the old.

   journal = {Methods},
   volume = {195},
   pages = {103-112},
   abstract = {Subjective belief elicitation about uncertain events has a long lineage in the economics and statistics literatures. Recent developments in the experimental elicitation and statistical estimation of subjective belief distributions allow inferences about whether these beliefs are biased relative to expert opinion, and the confidence with which they are held. Beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality interact with risk management efforts, so it is important to understand relationships between these beliefs and publicly disseminated statistics, particularly those based on evolving epidemiological models. The pandemic provides a unique setting over which to bracket the range of possible COVID-19 prevalence and mortality outcomes given the proliferation of estimates from epidemiological models. We rely on the epidemiological model produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation together with the set of epidemiological models summarised by FiveThirtyEight to bound prevalence and mortality outcomes for one-month, and December 1, 2020 time horizons. We develop a new method to partition these bounds into intervals, and ask subjects to place bets on these intervals, thereby revealing their beliefs. The intervals are constructed such that if beliefs are consistent with epidemiological models, subjects are best off betting the same amount on every interval. We use an incentivised experiment to elicit beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality from 598 students at Georgia State University, using six temporally-spaced waves between May and November 2020. We find that beliefs differ markedly from epidemiological models, which has implications for public health communication about the risks posed by the virus.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   journal = {eLife},
   volume = {11},
   pages = {e70767},
   abstract = {The distribution of the generation time (the interval between individuals becoming infected and transmitting the virus) characterises changes in the transmission risk during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Inferring the generation time distribution is essential to plan and assess public health measures. We previously developed a mechanistic approach for estimating the generation time, which provided an improved fit to data from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019-March 2020) compared to existing models (Hart et al., 2021). However, few estimates of the generation time exist based on data from later in the pandemic. Here, using data from a household study conducted from March-November 2020 in the UK, we provide updated estimates of the generation time. We considered both a commonly used approach in which the transmission risk is assumed to be independent of when symptoms develop, and our mechanistic model in which transmission and symptoms are linked explicitly. Assuming independent transmission and symptoms, we estimated a mean generation time (4.2 days, 95% credible interval 3.3-5.3 days) similar to previous estimates from other countries, but with a higher standard deviation (4.9 days, 3.0-8.3 days). Using our mechanistic approach, we estimated a longer mean generation time (5.9 days, 5.2-7.0 days) and a similar standard deviation (4.8 days, 4.0-6.3 days). As well as estimating the generation time using data from the entire study period, we also considered whether the generation time varied temporally. Both models suggest a shorter mean generation time in September-November 2020 compared to earlier months. Since the SARS-CoV-2 generation time appears to be changing, further data collection and analysis is necessary to continue to monitor ongoing transmission and inform future public health policy decisions.Copyright © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

   title = {Accurate forecasts of the effectiveness of interventions against Ebola may require models that account for variations in symptoms during infection},
   journal = {Epidemics},
   volume = {29},
   pages = {100371},
   abstract = {Epidemiological models are routinely used to predict the effects of interventions aimed at reducing the impacts of Ebola epidemics. Most models of interventions targeting symptomatic hosts, such as isolation or treatment, assume that all symptomatic hosts are equally likely to be detected. In other words, following an incubation period, the level of symptoms displayed by an individual host is assumed to remain constant throughout an infection. In reality, however, symptoms vary between different stages of infection. During an Ebola infection, individuals progress from initial non-specific symptoms through to more severe phases of infection. Here we compare predictions of a model in which a constant symptoms level is assumed to those generated by a more epidemiologically realistic model that accounts for varying symptoms during infection. Both models can reproduce observed epidemic data, as we show by fitting the models to data from the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 2014-16 epidemic in Liberia. However, for both of these epidemics, when interventions are altered identically in the models with and without levels of symptoms that depend on the time since first infection, predictions from the models differ. Our work highlights the need to consider whether or not varying symptoms should be accounted for in models used by decision makers to assess the likely efficacy of Ebola interventions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

To describe the idea about the factors influencing the outbreak data, we presented the current situation of the COVID-19 outbreak with graphical trends. Methods: Primary data were collected and analyzed by using a pre-created Google Survey form having a pre-set questionnaire on the social distancing status of different districts. Secondary data on the total and the daily number of laboratory tests, confirmed positive cases, and death cases were extracted from the publicly available sources to make predictions. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R) based on the SIR mathematical model and predicted the probable fate of this pandemic in Bangladesh. Results: Quarantine situations in different regions of Bangladesh were evaluated and presented. We also provided tentative forecasts until 31 May 2020 and found that the predicted curve followed the actual curve approximately. Estimated R-values (6.924) indicated that infection rate would be greater than the recovery rate. Furthermore, by calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to fit the reported data, we assume the ultimate ending of the pandemic in Bangladesh by December 2022. Conclusion: We hope that the results of our analysis could contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak and help the concerned authority toward decision making.

Governments around the world are making great efforts to sustain markets as there are signs showing that the health crisis will be followed by an economic crisis. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Romanian stock market. For this purpose, we considered the influence on the Bucharest Exchange Trading (BET) index of such variables as the number of new cases and the number of new deaths caused by COVID-19, measures taken by authorities, and the international economic context. The collected data covered the period between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2021. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound cointegration test was used to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the stock market. The results showed a significant long-term negative impact of the pandemic on the BET index for Romania, while the European economic context had a positive influence. Therefore, these results could be used by authorities as a good guideline for the efficient management of measures that aim to reduce the negative effects of the healthcare crisis.},

   abstract = {Background As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential for understanding clinical prognosis, planning healthcare capacity, and epidemic forecasting. The case-fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but it can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to (1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data and (2) infer estimates of SARSCoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case-fatality ratio (sCFR), and the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. Method and findings We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei Province, China, and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain, and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were as follows: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2%-4.2%), and IFR 2.9% (2.4%-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe, estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4%-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1%-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among individuals 80 years or older, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI 16%-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI 28%-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required, and these are not available in all countries. Conclusions We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Hauser et al.

   volume = {15},
   number = {6},
   pages = {e1007083},
   abstract = {The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa substantially reduced AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. However, its success is threatened by the emergence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model presented here aims at investigating the time trends and factors driving NNRTI resistance in South Africa. MARISA is a compartmental model that includes the key aspects of the local HIV epidemic: continuum of care, disease progression, and gender. The dynamics of NNRTI resistance emergence and transmission are then added to this framework. Model parameters are informed using data from HIV cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) and literature estimates, or fitted to UNAIDS estimates. Using this novel approach of triangulating clinical and resistance data from various sources, MARISA reproduces the time trends of HIV in South Africa in 2005-2016, with a decrease in new infections, undiagnosed individuals, and AIDS-related deaths. MARISA captures the dynamics of the spread of NNRTI resistance: high levels of acquired drug resistance (ADR, in 83% of first-line treatment failures in 2016), and increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR, in 8.1% of ART initiators in 2016). Simulation of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative public health policies shows that increasing treatment coverage would have resulted in fewer new infections and deaths, at the cost of higher TDR (11.6% in 2016 for doubling the treatment rate). Conversely, improving switching to second-line treatment would have led to lower TDR (6.5% in 2016 for doubling the switching rate) and fewer new infections and deaths. Implementing drug resistance testing would have had little impact. The rapid ART scale-up and inadequate switching to second-line treatment were the key drivers of the spread of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. However, even though some interventions could have substantially reduced the level of NNRTI resistance, no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented this spread. Thus, by combining epidemiological data on HIV in South Africa with biological data on resistance evolution, our modelling approach identified key factors driving NNRTI resistance, highlighting the need of alternative first-line regimens.Copyright © 2019 Hauser et al.},

Attempts to understand the relationship between economics and epidemiology has led to a new generation of integrated mathematical models. The data needs for these models transcend those of the individual fields, especially where human interaction patterns are closely linked with economic activity. In this article, we reflect upon modelling efforts to date, discussing the data needs that they have identified, both for understanding the consequences of the pandemic and policy responses to it through analysis of historic data and for the further development of this new and exciting interdisciplinary field.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {Knowing COVID-19 epidemiological distributions, such as the time from patient admission to death, is directly relevant to effective primary and secondary care planning, and moreover, the mathematical modelling of the pandemic generally. We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21 000 - 157 000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.},

   journal = {Journal of Clinical Medicine},
   volume = {9},
   number = {10},
   pages = {1-10},
   abstract = {A surge in hospital admissions was observed in Japan in late March 2020, and the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) temporarily reduced from March to May as a result of the closure of host and hostess clubs, shortening the opening hours of bars and restaurants, and requesting a voluntary reduction of contact outside the household. To prepare for the second wave, it is vital to anticipate caseload demand, and thus, the number of required hospital beds for admitted cases and plan interventions through scenario analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the first wave data by age group so that the age-specific number of hospital admissions could be projected for the second wave. Because the age-specific patterns of the epidemic were different between urban and other areas, we analyzed datasets from two distinct cities: Osaka, where the cases were dominated by young adults, and Hokkaido, where the older adults accounted for the majority of hospitalized cases. By estimating the exponential growth rates of cases by age group and assuming probable reductions in those rates under interventions, we obtained projected epidemic curves of cases in addition to hospital admissions. We demonstrated that the longer our interventions were delayed, the higher the peak of hospital admissions. Although the approach relies on a simplistic model, the proposed framework can guide local government to secure the essential number of hospital beds for COVID-19 cases and formulate action plans.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical progress of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is often associated with severe pneumonia which may require intensive care, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The length of intensive care and the duration of these supportive therapies are clinically relevant outcomes. From the statistical perspective, these quantities are challenging to estimate due to episodes being time-dependent and potentially multiple, as well as being determined by the competing, terminal events of discharge alive and death., METHODS: We used multistate models to study COVID-19 patients' time-dependent progress and provide a statistical framework to estimate hazard rates and transition probabilities. These estimates can then be used to quantify average sojourn times of clinically important states such as intensive care and invasive ventilation. We have made two real data sets of COVID-19 patients (n = 24* and n = 53**) and the corresponding statistical code publically available., RESULTS: The expected lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay at day 28 for the two cohorts were 15.05* and 19.62** days, while expected durations of mechanical ventilation were 7.97* and 9.85** days. Predicted mortality stood at 51%* and 15%**. Patients mechanically ventilated at the start of the example studies had a longer expected duration of ventilation (12.25*, 14.57** days) compared to patients non-ventilated (4.34*, 1.41** days) after 28 days. Furthermore, initially ventilated patients had a higher risk of death (54%* and 20%** vs. 48%* and 6%**) after 4 weeks. These results are further illustrated in stacked probability plots for the two groups from time zero, as well as for the entire cohort which depicts the predicted proportions of the patients in each state over follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: The multistate approach gives important insights into the progress of COVID-19 patients in terms of ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and mortality. In addition to avoiding frequent pitfalls in survival analysis, the methodology enables active cases to be analyzed by allowing for censoring. The stacked probability plots provide extensive information in a concise manner that can be easily conveyed to decision makers regarding healthcare capacities. Furthermore, clear comparisons can be made among different baseline characteristics.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The timing and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic response and control varied among the regions and from one country to the other, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. The focus of this work is on the early phase of the disease when control measures can be most effective. We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). It was found that in the early phase of COVID-19 spread the disease follows a certain empirical law that is common in all regions considered. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. These rates responded quickly to the launch of the 1st-level Response to Major Public Health Emergency in each region, peaking after 1-2 days, reaching their inflection points after 10-19 days, and dropping to zero after 11-18 days since the 1st-level response was launched. By March 29th, the mortality rates were 0.08% (Zhejiang), 0.54% (Guangdong) and 3.95% (Xinjiang). Subsequent modeling simulations were based on the working assumption that similar infection transmission control measures were taken in South Korea as in Zhejiang on February 25th, in Italy as in Guangdong on February 25th, and in Iran as in Xinjiang on March 8th. The results showed that by June 15th the accumulated infection cases could have been reduced by 32.49% (South Korea), 98.16% (Italy) and 85.73% (Iran). The surface air temperature showed stronger association with transmission rate of COVID-19 than surface relative humidity. On the basis of these findings, disease control measures were shown to be particularly effective in flattening and shrinking the COVID-10 case curve, which could effectively reduce the severity of the disease and mitigate medical burden. The proposed empirical law and the SEIR-temporal moving window model can also be used to study infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

   journal = {Computers in Biology and Medicine},
   volume = {165},
   pages = {107431},
   abstract = {Since the end of 2019 the COVID-19 repeatedly surges with most countries/territories experiencing multiple waves, and mechanism-based epidemic models played important roles in understanding the transmission mechanism of multiple epidemic waves. However, capturing temporal changes of the transmissibility of COVID-19 during the multiple waves keeps ill-posed problem for traditional mechanism-based epidemic compartment models, because that the transmission rate is usually assumed to be specific piecewise functions and more parameters are added to the model once multiple epidemic waves involved, which poses a huge challenge to parameter estimation. Meanwhile, data-driven deep neural networks fail to discover the driving factors of repeated outbreaks and lack interpretability. In this study, aiming at developing a data-driven method to project time-dependent parameters but also merging the advantage of mechanism-based models, we propose a transmission dynamics informed neural network (TDINN) by encoding the SEIRD compartment model into deep neural networks. We show that the proposed TDINN algorithm performs very well when fitting the COVID-19 epidemic data with multiple waves, where the epidemics in the United States, Italy, South Africa, and Kenya, and several outbreaks the Omicron variant in China are taken as examples. In addition, the numerical simulation shows that the trained TDINN can also perform as a predictive model to capture the future development of COVID-19 epidemic. We find that the transmission rate inferred by the TDINN frequently fluctuates, and a feedback loop between the epidemic shifting and the changes of transmissibility drives the occurrence of multiple waves. We observe a long response delay to the implementation of control interventions in the four countries, while the decline of the transmission rate in the outbreaks in China usually happens once the implementation of control interventions. The further simulation show that 17 days' delay of the response to the implementation of control interventions lead to a roughly four-fold increase in daily reported cases in one epidemic wave in Italy, which suggest that a rapid response to policies that strengthen control interventions can be effective in flattening the epidemic curve or avoiding subsequent epidemic waves. We observe that the transmission rate in the outbreaks in China is already decreasing before enhancing control interventions, providing the evidence that the increasing of the epidemics can drive self-conscious behavioural changes to protect against infections.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected billions of people worldwide, and the lessons learned need to be concluded to get better prepared for the next pandemic. Early identification of high-risk patients is important for appropriate treatment and distribution of medical resources. A generalizable and easy-to-use COVID-19 severity stratification model is vital and may provide references for clinicians. Method(s): Three COVID-19 cohorts (one discovery cohort and two validation cohorts) were included. Longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from the discovery cohort (n = 39, mild = 15, critical = 24). The immune characteristics of COVID-19 and critical COVID-19 were analyzed by comparison with those of healthy volunteers (n = 16) and patients with mild COVID-19 using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Subsequently, machine learning models were developed based on immune signatures and the most valuable laboratory parameters that performed well in distinguishing mild from critical cases. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data from a published study (n = 43) and electronic health records from a prospective cohort study (n = 840) were used to verify the role of crucial clinical laboratory and immune signature parameters in the stratification of COVID-19 severity. Result(s): Patients with COVID-19 were determined with disturbed glucose and tryptophan metabolism in two major innate immune clusters. Critical patients were further characterized by significant depletion of classical dendritic cells (cDCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and CD4+ central memory T cells (Tcm), along with increased systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The machine learning models based on the level of cDCs and LDH showed great potential for predicting critical cases. The model performances in severity stratification were validated in two cohorts (AUC = 0.77 and 0.88, respectively) infected with different strains in different periods. The reference limits of cDCs and LDH as biomarkers for predicting critical COVID-19 were 1.2% and 270.5 U/L, respectively. Conclusion(s): Overall, we developed and validated a generalizable and easy-to-use COVID-19 severity stratification model using machine learning algorithms. The level of cDCs and LDH will assist clinicians in making quick decisions during future pandemics.Copyright © 2024 He, Cui, Zhao, Wu, Zhang, Xue, Zhang, Ge and Leng.},

   abstract = {A pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread around the world. A total of 2,314,621 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 157,847 deaths (6.8%) were reported globally by 20 April 2020. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of emerging infectious disease, traditional models for predicting the peak of the epidemic often show inconsistent results. With the aim to timely judge the epidemic peak and provide support for decisions for resuming production and returning to normal life based on publicly reported data, we used a seven-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named the "epidemic evaluation index" (EEI). We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong to verify the practicability of the new index, and then applied it to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis. The results showed that the epidemic peaked, respectively, on 9 February and 5 February 2020, in Hubei Province and other provinces in China. The proposed index can be applied for judging the epidemic peak. While the global COVID-19 epidemic reached its peak in the middle of April, the epidemic peaks in some countries have not yet appeared. Global and united efforts are still needed to eventually eliminate the epidemic.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Background: Governments across the globe responded with different strategies to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries adopted measures, which have been perceived controversial, others pursued a strategy aiming for herd immunity. The latter is even more controversial and has been called unethical by the WHO Director-General. Inevitably, without proper control measures, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessing response measures to increasing numbers of infection. Methods and findings: We extend the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness web interface CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to study the hypothetical effect of increased morbidity and mortality due to 'multi-infections', either acquired at by successive infective contacts during the course of one infection or by a single infective contact with a multi-infected individual. The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction ("lockdown") at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multiinfections and different susceptibility to multi-infections in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi-infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential second lockdown can substantially decrease the epidemic peak, the number of multi-infections and deaths. Conclusion(s): Enhanced morbidity and mortality due to multiple disease exposure is a potential threat in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserves more attention. Particularly it underlines another facet questioning disease management strategies aiming for herd immunity.Copyright © 2021 Helle et al.

   pages = {e488-e496},
   abstract = {Background: Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. Method(s): We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Finding(s): Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation(s): In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral health disorders have steadily increased and been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though behavioral health disorders can be successfully mitigated with early implementation of evidence-based parent management strategies, education for pediatric residents on behavioral health anticipatory guidance has been limited to date, with training challenges compounded by the physical distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) simulations provide an opportunity to train residents on this complex competency by allowing deliberate practice of necessary skills while adhering to current social distancing guidelines., OBJECTIVE: This study explored the usability of a VR-based behavioral health anticipatory guidance curriculum for pediatric residents., METHODS: This mixed methods study included 14 postgraduate third-year pediatric residents who completed the behavioral health anticipatory guidance VR curriculum. Residents completed the MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire to assess immersion in the virtual environment. Semistructured interviews were used to elucidate residents' perspectives on the curriculum's content and format. The interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis., RESULTS: Quantitatively, residents reported a high degree of immersion, spatial presence, and cognitive involvement. Most residents (11/14, 79%) agreed or strongly agreed that it seemed as though they took part in the action of the simulation. Qualitatively, two themes emerged from the data: (1) the curriculum expands behavioral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing knowledge and skills and (2) VR technology is uniquely positioned to develop competence. These themes revealed that the curriculum expanded their current level of knowledge and skill, addressed training gaps, and was applicable to all residents. Additionally, residents experienced VR as immersive, feasible, realistic to the clinic setting, and a safe space to practice and learn new skills., CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data indicates that VR may be an effective tool to teach pediatric residents behavioral health anticipatory guidance, meeting a current gap in medical education training. This VR curriculum is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic given the increased behavioral health concerns of families.

   abstract = {The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused several million confirmed cases worldwide. The necessity of keeping open and accessible public commercial establishments such as supermarkets or pharmacies increases during the pandemic provided that distancing rules and crowd control are satisfied. Herein, using agent-based models, we explore the potential spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 considering the case of a small size supermarket. For diverse distancing rules and number of simultaneous users (customers), we question flexible and limited movement policies, guiding the flow and interactions of users in place. Results indicate that a guided, limited in movement and well-organized policy combined with a distance rule of at least 1 m and a small number of users may aid in the mitigation of potential new contagions in more than 90% compared to the usual policy of flexible movement with more users which may reach up to 64% of mitigation of potential new infections under the same distancing conditions. This study may guide novel strategies for the mitigation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, at any stage, and prevention of future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses.

   abstract = {The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is overwhelming many health-care systems. As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. The majority of existing models assume random diffusion but do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals, i.e. the underlying human interaction network, whose structure is known to be scale-free. Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals. Although applicable to infectious disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models.},

Due to the high genetic mutations of the virus, there has been a prolonged search for definitive therapeutic discovery, leading to extended periods of home quarantine. As a result, homes have become multipurpose spaces for work, education, sports, and other daily activities. Given the importance of residential buildings as the first line of defense against possible future pandemics, a model has been proposed to assess their readiness to handle pandemics using a sustainable development approach. This study investigates the most crucial criteria for evaluating residential buildings and applies them in a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. The final evaluation model is presented using the SWARA and COCOSO methods, along with a set of criteria selected and weighted by experts. The study shows that the criteria related to health and safety are more critical than other sectors. Buildings that meet the standards of this group better are likely to have a higher score.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing travel behaviour in many urban areas around the world since the beginning of 2020. As a consequence, bike-sharing schemes have been affected-partly due to the change in travel demand and behaviour as well as a shift from public transit. This study estimates the varying effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the London bike-sharing system (Santander Cycles) over the period March-December 2020. We employed a Bayesian second-order random walk time-series model to account for temporal correlation in the data. We compared the observed number of cycle hires and hire time with their respective counterfactuals (what would have been if the pandemic had not happened) to estimate the magnitude of the change caused by the pandemic. The results indicated that following a reduction in cycle hires in March and April 2020, the demand rebounded from May 2020, remaining in the expected range of what would have been if the pandemic had not occurred. This could indicate the resiliency of Santander Cycles. With respect to hire time, an important increase occurred in April, May, and June 2020, indicating that bikes were hired for longer trips, perhaps partly due to a shift from public transit.Copyright © 2021 Heydari et al.

Moreover, we present an optimal control model for minimizing both the number of infected people and the cost associated with each control. Four preventive measures are to be taken to control the outbreaks: social distancing, lockdown, the number of tests, and the number of chlorine water tablets (CWTs). Under the current conditions and resources available in Yemen, various policies are simulated to evaluate the optimal policy. The results obtained confirm that the policy of providing resources for the distribution of CWTs, providing sufficient resources for testing with an average social distancing, and quarantining of infected individuals has significant effects on flattening the epidemic curves.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The presence of the COVID-19 and racism pandemics underscored the need for a basic model of advocacy for psychologists and budding psychologists. We offer a new model of action to be easily replicated, particularly during times of crisis, with aims to impact change locally and beyond the therapeutic space. METHOD(S): The D.C. Psychological Association (DCPA) actively responded to the double pandemics of COVID-19. Using a posthoc qualitative analysis four steps were identified: organizing, providing support and education, and engaging in advocacy (O-SEA Approach), which all centered the specific skill set of psychologists and psychologists-in-training. RESULT(S): Measures of success included the following: increased membership and engagement of members, development of relevant programming to providers and the community, community attendance of events, statements indicating knowledge gained by providers, new connections with local organizations and officials, and local legislative change. CONCLUSION(S): The O-SEA Approach provides a framework for local advocacy that can empower psychologists to contribute their expertise in tangible and impactful ways. This model seeks justice for all people through elevating the voices of the unjustly marginalized, providing support and education to mental health providers and the community, and advocating for policy that is grounded in culturally relevant research. The O-SEA Approach can be successful in these aspirations and be applied in communities across the nation. Clinical Impact Statement: The permanence of racism in the United States is evident throughout history when examining America's social, economic, and political systems. Racism's reverberations are present locally, in the nation's capital, through its policing techniques and gentrification, among other insidious manifestations. COVID-19's global impact has been reported to have particularly deleterious effects on Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) through impacting housing, food, and income security while simultaneously underscoring the lack of access to health resources. This demanded a response by mental health professionals. Consequently, the D.C. Psychological Association made efforts to organize, support, educate, and advocate for the local community through what is called the O-SEA Approach.

   abstract = {Pandemic influenza, triggered by the mutation of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (IFV), has caused considerable damage to public health. In order to identify such pandemic IFVs, antibodies that specifically recognize viral surface proteins have been widely used. However, since the analysis of a newly discovered virus is time consuming, this delays the availability of suitable detection antibodies, making this approach unsuitable for the early identification of pandemic IFVs. Here we propose a label-free semiconductor-based biosensor functionalized with sialic-acid-containing glycans for the rapid identification of the pandemic IFVs present in biological fluids. Specific glycans are able to recognize wild-type human and avian IFVs, suggesting that they are useful in discovering pandemic IFVs at the early stages of an outbreak. We successfully demonstrated that a dual-channel integrated FET biosensing system, which were modified with 6'-sialyllactose and 3'-sialyllactose for each gate area, can directly and specifically detect human H1N1 and avian H5N1 IFV particles, respectively, present in nasal mucus. Furthermore, to examine the possibility of identifying pandemic IFVs, the signal attributed to the detection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) particles, which was selected as a prime model of a pandemic IFV, was clearly observed from both sensing gates. Our findings suggest that the proposed glycan-immobilized sensing system could be useful in identifying new pandemic IFVs at the source of an outbreak.},

   volume = {557},
   pages = {111331},
   abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 saw severe detriments to public health being inflicted by COVID-19 disease throughout 2020. In the lead up to Christmas 2020, the UK Government sought an easement of social restrictions that would permit spending time with others over the Christmas period, whilst limiting the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2. In November 2020, plans were published to allow individuals to socialise within 'Christmas bubbles' with friends and family. This policy involved a planned easing of restrictions in England between 23-27 December 2020, with Christmas bubbles allowing people from up to three households to meet throughout the holiday period. We estimated the epidemiological impact of both this and alternative bubble strategies that allowed extending contacts beyond the immediate household. We used a stochastic individual-based model for a synthetic population of 100,000 households, with demographic and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological characteristics comparable to England as of November 2020. We evaluated five Christmas bubble scenarios for the period 23-27 December 2020, assuming our populations of households did not have symptomatic infection present and were not in isolation as the eased social restrictions began. Assessment comprised incidence and cumulative infection metrics. We tested the sensitivity of the results to a situation where it was possible for households to be in isolation at the beginning of the Christmas bubble period and also when there was lower adherence to testing, contact tracing and isolation interventions. We found that visiting family and friends over the holiday period for a shorter duration and in smaller groups was less risky than spending the entire five days together. The increases in infection from greater amounts of social mixing disproportionately impacted the eldest. We provide this account as an illustration of a real-time contribution of modelling insights to a scientific advisory group, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O) for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) in the UK, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

   abstract = {Teledentistry is a blend of communication and dentistry which associates the exchange of information of health, images and treatment outlines in remote areas. Teledentistry has the capability to advance the approach to oral care by delivering oral health care at a reasonable cost in areas where there is reduced access to dental clinics. This is an alternative and innovative method of delivering oral health care. The aim of the study is to evaluate the awareness of teledentistry among undergraduate dental students. A cross sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 100 undergraduate dental students. The questionnaire was circulated through google forms. The results were tabulated and appropriate statistics was done using SPSS software. The questions were separated based on knowledge, attitude and practice. From the results we can conclude 51% are aware of teledentistry; and most of them were introduced to it through workshops in college. 42% know the definition of teledentistry. Students also responded that teledentistry is most useful in the field of 5orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery. 81% of the respondents affirm that teledentistry is a good tool to be used during lockdown. Within the limitations of the study, we can conclude that there is a need to increase awareness about the teledentistry among undergraduate students. In the present scenario of Covid 19 pandemic the use of teledentistry can be exploited as the access to dental clinics has decreased. Hence students should be made more aware of teledentistry as it is the need of the hour.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has long become a worldwide pandemic. It is responsible for the death of over two million people and posed an economic recession. This paper studies the spread pattern of COVID-19, aiming to establish a prediction model for this event. We harness Data Mining and Machine Learning methodologies to train regression models to predict the number of confirmed cases in a spatial-temporal space. We introduce an innovative concept - the Center of Infection Mass (CoIM) - adapted from the field of physics. We empirically evaluated our model on western European countries, based on the CoIM index and other features, and showed that a relatively high accurate prediction of the spread can be obtained. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduced a prediction methodology and proved empirically that a prediction can be made even to the range of over a month; second, we showed promise in adopting the CoIM index to prediction models, when models that adopt the CoIM yield significantly better results than those that discard it. By applying our model, and better controlling the inherent tradeoff between life-saving and economy, we believe that decision-makers can take close to optimal measures. Thus, this methodology may contribute to public welfare. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted cancer screening and treatment delivery, but COVID-19's impact on tobacco cessation treatment for cancer patients who smoke has not been widely explored. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a sequential cross-sectional analysis of data collected from 34 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers participating in NCI's Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I), across three reporting periods: one prior to COVID-19 (January-June 2019) and two during the pandemic (January-June 2020, January-June 2021). Using McNemar's Test of Homogeneity, we assessed changes in services offered and implementation activities over time. RESULT(S): The proportion of centers offering remote treatment services increased each year for Quitline referrals (56%, 68%, and 91%; p = .000), telephone counseling (59%, 79%, and 94%; p = .002), and referrals to Smokefree TXT (27%, 47%, and 56%; p = .006). Centers offering video-based counseling increased from 2020 to 2021 (18% to 59%; p = .006), Fewer than 10% of centers reported laying off tobacco treatment staff. Compared to early 2020, in 2021 C3I centers reported improvements in their ability to maintain staff and clinician morale, refer to external treatment services, train providers to deliver tobacco treatment, and modify clinical workflows. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid transition to new telehealth program delivery of tobacco treatment for patients with cancer. C3I cancer centers adjusted rapidly to challenges presented by the pandemic, with improvements reported in staff morale and ability to train providers, refer patients to tobacco treatment, and modify clinical workflows. These factors enabled C3I centers to sustain evidence-based tobacco treatment implementation during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: This work describes how NCI-designated cancer centers participating in the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) adapted to challenges to sustain evidence-based tobacco use treatment programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work offers a model for resilience and rapid transition to remote tobacco treatment services delivery and proposes a policy and research agenda for telehealth services as an approach to sustaining evidence-based tobacco treatment programs.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has sent ripple effects across health systems and impacted the burden of many other diseases, such as malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. This study takes a mixed method approach to assess the impact of COVID-19 on malaria control programs in three rural communes in Benin. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with key informants who play important roles in malaria control in Benin at three levels of the health system-national, health zone, and commune. Using a purposive sampling technique, informants were interviewed regarding their roles in malaria control, the impact of the pandemic on their activities, and the mitigation strategies adopted. Relevant themes were identified by content analysis. We then formulated an agent-based model of malaria epidemiology to assess the impacts of treatment disruption on malaria burden. The key informant interviews revealed that essential aspects of malaria control were upheld in Benin due to the close collaboration of public health practitioners and health care providers at all levels of the health system. There were some disruptions to case management services for malaria at the start of the pandemic due to the public avoiding health centers and a brief shortage of malaria treatment that may not be entirely attributable to the pandemic. Results from the agent-based model suggest that duration, severity, and timing of treatment disruption can impact malaria burden in a synergistic manner, though the effects are small given the relatively mild disruptions observed. This study highlights the importance of top-down leadership in health emergencies, as well as the critical role of community health workers in preventing negative health outcomes for their communities. We also showcased the integration of qualitative research and mathematical models-an underappreciated form of mixed methods research that offer immense value in the continued evaluation of rapidly evolving health emergencies.

   abstract = {Social distancing is the core policy response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the "loss from anarchy" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.},

   abstract = {Background: Globally, one-third of those enrolled on HIV treatment, present with advanced HIV disease (AHD). AHD is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, risk of onward transmission and public health costs. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has delivered 15 years of HIV care in Myanmar and has extensive experience in the treatment of AHD patients. We describe burden of AHD in MSF Myanmar cohort and the main risk factors for mortality. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis, using routinely collected patient-level data. The study population included patients presenting with AHD (CD4 < =200 cells/mL and/or WHOstage 3/4) in MSF Myanmar cohort from 2003 to 2018). We included antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive patients that initiated ART at MSF and patients returning to care after being lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) from MSF HIV cohort. For both groups we compared patients with AHD to those without. We performed mortality and a risk factor analyses using Cox regression. Result(s): 34,242 ART naive patients were enrolled during the study period and 25,435 (74.3%) presented with AHD. In this group 33.9% presented with tuberculosis, 1.6% with cryptococcal meningitis, 1% CI, confidence interval; UCOD, underlying cause of death; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TB, tuberculosis, ICD, International Classification of Disease. with ocular cytomegalovirus infection and 0.1 % had penicilliosis at enrolment. ART naive patients presenting with AHD at enrolment were at 3.4 higher risk of death than ART naive patients who did not present with AHD at enrolment. The main risk factors for death were documented users of injecting drugs and sex work, while age 40 to 65 was a protective factor. There were 7811 patients who returned to care after being LTFU; 4707 (60.3%) patients presented with AHD. Those with AHD were at a 2.16 higher risk of death than those without AHD when returning to care. Sex work, male gender and tuberculosis were risk factors for death. Conclusion(s): In Myanmar, there was a high proportion of advanced HIV disease among ART naive and people returning to care after being LTFU. Patients with AHD had a higher risk of death during treatment and mortality risk factors were associated with vulnerable key populations. Our findings advocate for the introduction of AHD packages of care in models of care designed for concentrated HIV epidemics that target key populations.},

   title = {A Natural Language Processing Model for COVID-19 Detection Based on Dutch General Practice Electronic Health Records by Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers: Development and Validation Study},
   journal = {Journal of medical Internet research},
   volume = {25},
   pages = {e49944},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) models such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) hold promise in revolutionizing disease identification from electronic health records (EHRs) by potentially enhancing efficiency and accuracy. However, their practical application in practice settings demands a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to development and validation. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges in disease identification due to limited testing availability and challenges in handling unstructured data. In the Netherlands, where general practitioners (GPs) serve as the first point of contact for health care, EHRs generated by these primary care providers contain a wealth of potentially valuable information. Nonetheless, the unstructured nature of free-text entries in EHRs poses challenges in identifying trends, detecting disease outbreaks, or accurately pinpointing COVID-19 cases., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a BERT model for detecting COVID-19 consultations in general practice EHRs in the Netherlands., METHODS: The BERT model was initially pretrained on Dutch language data and fine-tuned using a comprehensive EHR data set comprising confirmed COVID-19 GP consultations and non-COVID-19-related consultations. The data set was partitioned into a training and development set, and the model's performance was evaluated on an independent test set that served as the primary measure of its effectiveness in COVID-19 detection. To validate the final model, its performance was assessed through 3 approaches. First, external validation was applied on an EHR data set from a different geographic region in the Netherlands. Second, validation was conducted using results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test data obtained from municipal health services. Lastly, correlation between predicted outcomes and COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the Netherlands was assessed, encompassing the period around the outbreak of the pandemic in the Netherlands, that is, the period before widespread testing., RESULTS: The model development used 300,359 GP consultations. We developed a highly accurate model for COVID-19 consultations (accuracy 0.97, F1-score 0.90, precision 0.85, recall 0.85, specificity 0.99). External validations showed comparable high performance. Validation on PCR test data showed high recall but low precision and specificity. Validation using hospital data showed significant correlation between COVID-19 predictions of the model and COVID-19-related hospitalizations (F1-score 96.8; P<.001; R2=0.69). Most importantly, the model was able to predict COVID-19 cases weeks before the first confirmed case in the Netherlands., CONCLUSIONS: The developed BERT model was able to accurately identify COVID-19 cases among GP consultations even preceding confirmed cases. The validated efficacy of our BERT model highlights the potential of NLP models to identify disease outbreaks early, exemplifying the power of multidisciplinary efforts in harnessing technology for disease identification. Moreover, the implications of this study extend beyond COVID-19 and offer a blueprint for the early recognition of various illnesses, revealing that such models could revolutionize disease surveillance.

But while Britain has long been a pioneer of predictive epidemiology and disease modellers occupied influential positions on key committees that advised the government on its response to the coronavirus pandemic, as in 1918 Britain mounted one of the least effective responses to Covid-19 of any country in the world. Arguing that this 'failure of expertise' was the result of medical and political complacency and over-reliance on disease models predicated on influenza, this paper uses the lens of medical history to show how medical attitudes to Covid-19 mirrored those of the English medical profession in 1918. Rather than putting our faith in preventive medicine and statistical technologies to predict the course of epidemics and dictate suppressive measures in future, I argue we need to cultivate more profound forms of imaginative engagement with infectious disease outbreaks that take account of the long history of quarantines and the lived experiences of pandemics. A useful starting point would be to recognize that while measures such as the Rdegree may be useful for calculating the reproductive rate of a virus, they can never capture the full risks of pandemics or their social complexity.

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to use available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors in subpopulations and epidemic dynamics at the population level to estimate probabilities of severe illness and the case and infection fatality rates (CFR and IFR) stratified across subgroups representing all combinations of the risk factors age, comorbidities, obesity, and smoking status. We focus on the first year of the epidemic in Los Angeles County (LAC) (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021), spanning three epidemic waves. A relative risk modeling approach was developed to estimate conditional effects from available marginal data. A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population. The fine-grained subpopulation-stratified estimates of COVID-19 outcomes produced in this study are useful in understanding disparities in the effect of the epidemic on different groups in LAC, and can inform analyses of targeted subpopulation-level policy interventions.Copyright © 2021 Horn et al.

   pages = {103506},
   abstract = {This paper considers the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on long-term individual lifetime consumption profiles. The framework for the analysis is a model that extends Strulik (2021) to include the government sector, where time preference is determined by individual health damage (deficit) distinct from normal aging. Thus, the health damage caused by COVID-19 changes the rate of time preference and consequently affects the Euler equation for consumption. Our theoretical contribution is the consistent incorporation of public health investment into the existing model to understand the effect of government measures against a pandemic. Numerical analysis based on this model is used to estimate changes in health status over time, trends in the rate of time preference, and individual lifetime consumption profiles, taking into account differences in age at the time of the pandemic and the nature of the government responses. Because the long-term negative economic impact would be enormous, we should avoid advocating for "living with COVID-19" without due consideration. The reopening of the economy must be accompanied by a commitment to the containment and elimination of infections with future novel coronaviruses. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The emergence of novel COVID-19 is causing an overload on public health sector and a high fatality rate. The key priority is to contain the epidemic and reduce the infection rate. It is imperative to stress on ensuring extreme social distancing of the entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. So, there is a need for an efficient optimizer algorithm that can solve NP-hard in addition to applied optimization problems. This article first proposes a novel COVID-19 optimizer Algorithm (CVA) to cover almost all feasible regions of the optimization problems. We also simulate the coronavirus distribution process in several countries around the globe. Then, we model a coronavirus distribution process as an optimization problem to minimize the number of COVID-19 infected countries and hence slow down the epidemic spread. Furthermore, we propose three scenarios to solve the optimization problem using most effective factors in the distribution process. Simulation results show one of the controlling scenarios outperforms the others. Extensive simulations using several optimization schemes show that the CVA technique performs best with up to 15%, 37%, 53% and 59% increase compared with Volcano Eruption Algorithm (VEA), Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), respectively.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in serious limitations for healthcare systems, and this study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 surges on in-patient care capacities in Iran employing the Adaptt tool. Using a cross-sectional study design, our study was carried out in the year 2022 using 1-year epidemiologic (polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 cases) and hospital capacity (beds and human resource) data from the official declaration of the pandemic in Iran in February 2020. We populated several scenarios, and in each scenario, a proportion of hospital capacity is assumed to be allocated to the COVID-19 patients. In most of the scenarios, no significant shortage was found in terms of bed and human resources. However, considering the need for treatment of non- COVID-19 cases, in one of the scenarios, it can be observed that during the peak period, the number of required and available specialists is exactly equal, which was a challenge during surge periods and resulted in extra hours of working and workforce burnout in hospitals. The shortage of intensive care unit beds and doctors specializing in internal medicine, infectious diseases, and anesthesiology also requires more attention for planning during the peak days of COVID-19.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic, and social challenges that continue to escalate. Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.Copyright © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

   abstract = {Between June and August 2020, an agent-based model was used to project rates of COVID-19 infection incidence and cases diagnosed as positive from 15 September to 31 October 2020 for 72 geographic settings. Five scenarios were modelled: a baseline scenario where no future changes were made to existing restrictions, and four scenarios representing small or moderate changes in restrictions at two intervals. Post hoc, upper and lower bounds for number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases were compared with actual data collected during the prediction window. A regression analysis with 17 covariates was performed to determine correlates of accurate projections. It was found that the actual data fell within the lower and upper bounds in 27 settings and out of bounds in 45 settings. The only statistically significant predictor of actual data within the predicted bounds was correct assumptions about future policy changes (OR 15.04; 95% CI 2.20-208.70; p=0.016). Frequent changes in restrictions implemented by governments, which the modelling team was not always able to predict, in part explains why the majority of model projections were inaccurate compared with actual outcomes and supports revision of projections when policies are changed as well as the importance of modelling teams collaborating with policy experts.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to the health of humans globally. While the spread of pathogens transcends geographical boundaries, the management of infectious diseases typically occurs within distinct spatial units, determined by geopolitical boundaries. The allocation of management resources within and across regions (the "governance structure") can affect epidemiological outcomes considerably, and policy-makers are often confronted with a choice between applying control measures uniformly or differentially across regions. Here, we investigate the extent to which uniform and non-uniform governance structures affect the costs of an infectious disease outbreak in two-patch systems using an optimal control framework. A uniform policy implements control measures with the same time varying rate functions across both patches, while these measures are allowed to differ between the patches in a non-uniform policy. We compare results from two systems of differential equations representing transmission of cholera and Ebola, respectively, to understand the interplay between transmission mode, governance structure and the optimal control of outbreaks. In our case studies, the governance structure has a meaningful impact on the allocation of resources and burden of cases, although the difference in total costs is minimal. Understanding how governance structure affects both the optimal control functions and epidemiological outcomes is crucial for the effective management of infectious diseases going forward.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Exploring the complicated relationships underlying the clinical information is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, few approaches are mature enough to show operational impact. Based on electronic medical records (EMRs) of 570 COVID-19 inpatients, we proposed an analysis model of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 based on the machine learning algorithms and complex networks. Introducing the medical information fusion, we constructed the heterogeneous information network to discover the complex relationships among the syndromes, symptoms, and medicines. We generated the numerical symptom (medicine) embeddings and divided them into seven communities (syndromes) using the combination of Skip-Gram model and Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithm. After analyzing the symptoms and medicine networks, we identified the key factors using six evaluation metrics of node centrality. The experimental results indicate that the proposed analysis model is capable of discovering the critical symptoms and symptom distribution for diagnosis; the key medicines and medicine combinations for treatment. Based on the latest COVID-19 clinical guidelines, this model could result in the higher accuracy results than the other representative clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to provide tremendously valuable guidance and help the physicians to combat the COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

It is found that (1) on the whole, the shock of global EPU and China's EPU on China's export to the OBOR/RCEP member countries is time-varying, different, and structurally significant; (2) during the pandemic, EPU has a significant short-term negative shock on China's gross exports and export to OBOR/RCEP members, and this shock is especially big in the case of global EPU. In the post-pandemic era, China should strengthen pandemic control and economic risk monitoring, continue with execution of multilateral FTAs and create a sustainably stable export trade environment.Copyright © 2021 Hu and Liu.},

We reconstructed global transmissions and potential demographic expansions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 based on genomic information. We found that intercontinental transmissions were rare in January and early February but drastically increased since late February. After world-wide implements of travel restrictions, the transmission frequencies decreased to a low level in April. We identified a total of 88 potential demographic expansions over the world based on the star-radiative networks and 75 of them were found in Europe and North America. The expansion numbers peaked in March and quickly dropped since April. These findings are highly concordant with epidemic reports and modelling results and highlight the significance of quarantine validity on the global spread of COVID-19.

   abstract = {Objective: To determine the accuracy of a predictive model for inpatient occupancy that was implemented at a large New England hospital to aid hospital recovery planning from the COVID-19 surge. Background(s): During recovery from COVID surges, hospitals must plan for multiple patient populations vying for inpatient capacity, so that they maintain access for emergency department (ED) patients while enabling time-sensitive scheduled procedures to go forward. To guide pandemic recovery planning, we implemented a model to predict hospital occupancy for COVID and non-COVID patients. Method(s): At a quaternary care hospital in New England, we included hospitalizations from March 10 to July 12, 2020 and subdivided them into COVID, non-COVID nonscheduled (NCNS), and non-COVID scheduled operating room (OR) hospitalizations. For the recovery period from May 25 to July 12, the model made daily hospital occupancy predictions for each population. The primary outcome was the daily mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) when comparing the predicted versus actual occupancy. Result(s): There were 444 COVID, 5637 NCNS, and 1218 non-COVID scheduled OR hospitalizations during the recovery period. For all populations, the MAPE and MAE for total occupancy were 2.8% or 22.3 hospitalizations per day; for general care, 2.6% or 17.8 hospitalizations per day; and for intensive care unit, 9.7% or 11.0 hospitalizations per day. Conclusion(s): The model was accurate in predicting hospital occupancy during the recovery period. Such models may aid hospital recovery planning so that enough capacity is maintained to care for ED hospitalizations while ensuring scheduled procedures can efficiently return.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common psychological and behavioral problem among adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's mental health. To date, few studies have documented the temporal changes in adolescents' psychological status during the pandemic, as well as the impact of large-scale public health intervention strategies. This study contributes to the existing evidence on the subject. Method(s): Participants were 6,023 adolescents aged 10years and older, with data from two waves of longitudinal surveys, including data for a 7-month interval before and during the pandemic. A cross-lagged model was used to test the bidirectional relationship between NSSI and depressive symptoms in adolescents; logistic regression analysis was used to explore the predictors of NSSI implementation in adolescents with depressive symptoms. Result(s): In this study, 32.69% participants reported depressive symptoms at baseline and 34.27% at follow-up; 44.34% participants with depressive symptoms reported NSSI at baseline and 53.44% at follow-up. The duration of the online class, depressed affect, and somatic and related activity were the risk factors for NSSI; sleep duration and positive mood were the protective factors. The lag effect of depression symptoms on NSSI is significant, and so is NSSI on depressive symptoms. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents' mental health has worsened, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of NSSI among those with depressive symptoms compared to pre-pandemic levels. Early screening for depression is crucial in preventing or decreasing NSSI in adolescents.Copyright © 2024 Hu, Peng, Du, Feng, Xie, Shi, Jia, Jiang and Zhao.},

We parametrize the model using the data of the COVID-19 pandemic and show that the optimal response strategy and mitigation outcome greatly rely on the mitigation duration, available resources, and cross-region human mobility.

   abstract = {The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019) was first reported at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency for the novel coronavirus. On 11 March 2020, the WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Due to the differences in population distribution, economic structure, degree of damage and other factors, the affected countries have introduced policies tailored to local conditions as a response to the pandemic, leading to different economic and social impacts. Consid-ering the highly heterogeneous spreading of COVID-19 across regions, this paper takes a specific country (China) as a case study of the spread of the disease and national intervention models for the COVID-19 pandemic. The research period of this article is from 17 December to 26 April 2020, be-cause this time period basically covered the important time nodes of the epidemic in China from animal-to-human transmission, limited human-to-human transmission, epidemic to gradual con-trol. This study is useful for comparing the effectiveness of different interventions at various stages of epidemic development within the same country and can also promote the comparison of the epidemic response interventions of different countries. Based on the conclusions of the model sim-ulation, this article evaluates the dual impact of the epidemic on people's wellbeing and the econ-omy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Objectives: To determine the probability of controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 in Peru, in a pre- and post-quarantine scenario using mathematical simulation models. Material(s) and Method(s): Outbreak simulations for the COVID-19 pandemic are performed, using stochastic equations under the following assumptions: a pre-quarantine population R0 of 2.7 or 3.5, a post-quarantine R0 of 1.5, 2 or 2.7, 18% or 40%, of asymptomatic positives and a maximum response capacity of 50 or 150 patients in the intensive care units. The success of isolation and contact tracing is evaluated, no other mitigation measures are included. Result(s): In the pre-quarantine stage, success in controlling more than 80% of the simulations occurred only if the isolation of positive cases was implemented from the first case, after which there was less than 40% probability of success. In post-quarantine, with 60 positive cases it is necessary to isolate them early, track all of their contacts and decrease the R0 to 1.5 for outbreak control to be successful in more than 80% of cases. Other scenarios have a low probability of success. Conclusion(s): The control of the outbreak in Peru during pre-quarantine stage demanded requirements that were difficult to comply with, therefore quarantine was necessary; to successfully suspend it would require a significant reduction in the spread of the disease, early isolation of positives and follow-up of all contacts of positive patients.Copyright © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

   abstract = {This paper proposes a susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) with isolation measures to evaluate the COVID-19 epidemic based on the prevention and control policy implemented by the Chinese government on February 23, 2020. According to the Chinese government's immediate isolation and centralized diagnosis of confirmed cases, and the adoption of epidemic tracking measures on patients to prevent further spread of the epidemic, we divide the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantine, confirmed and recovered. This paper proposes an SEIR model with isolation measures that simultaneously investigates the infectivity of the incubation period, reflects prevention and control measures and calculates the basic reproduction number of the model. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we estimated the parameters of the model and compared the simulation results of the model with actual data. We have considered the trend of the epidemic under different incubation periods of infectious capacity. When the incubation period is not contagious, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 33,870; and when the infectious capacity is 0.1 times the infectious capacity in the infectious period, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 57,950; when the infectious capacity is doubled, the peak number of confirmed will reach 109,300. Moreover, by changing the contact rate in the model, we found that as the intensity of prevention and control measures increase, the peak of the epidemic will come earlier, and the peak number of confirmed will also be significantly reduced. Under extremely strict prevention and control measures, the peak number of confirmed cases has dropped by nearly 50%. In addition, we use the EEMD method to decompose the time series data of the epidemic, and then combine the LSTM model to predict the trend of the epidemic. Compared with the method of directly using LSTM for prediction, more detailed information can be obtained.

   abstract = {Objectives: From 2013 to 2017, the avian influenza A (H7N9) virus frequently infected people in China, which seriously affected the public health of society. This study aimed to analyze the spatial characteristics of human infection with the H7N9 virus in China and assess the risk areas of the epidemic. Method(s): Using kernel density estimation, standard deviation ellipse analysis, spatial and temporal scanning cluster analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis, the spatial characteristics and possible risk factors of the epidemic were studied. Meteorological factors, time (month), and environmental factors were combined to establish an epidemic risk assessment proxy model to assess the risk range of an epidemic. Result(s): The epidemic situation was significantly correlated with atmospheric pressure, temperature, and daily precipitation (P < 0.05), and there were six temporal and spatial clusters. The fitting accuracy of the epidemic risk assessment agent-based model for lower-risk, low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk was 0.795, 0.672, 0.853, 0.825, respectively. Conclusion(s): This H7N9 epidemic was found to have more outbreaks in winter and spring. It gradually spread to the inland areas of China. This model reflects the risk areas of human infection with the H7N9 virus.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

   volume = {84},
   pages = {103145},
   abstract = {The worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated social distancing measures have produced alterations in park visits of individuals, as well as their park-based physical activity (e.g. running exercise). Although studies on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in running activity patterns are becoming an emerging focus, less is known about how these changes are related to the environmental attributes of parks before and after the pandemic, the knowledge of which is essential to planning green infrastructure that better supports physical activities. Therefore, we employed a volunteered geographic information approach to investigate the runnability of park trails in Shenzhen, utilizing self-tracking routes from Strava, in order to uncover the associations between trail characteristics and park features with the running intensity before and after the pandemic. Multilevel regression model analyses revealed that trail network connectivity was the only environmental attribute indicating consistent and positive associations with running intensity. Blue space density was positively correlated with running intensity in urban parks but indicated no significant association in forest parks before the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic era, population density was positively related to running intensity in urban and forest parks. However, after the pandemic, the associations between running behaviours and population density remained positive in forest parks but turned insignificant in urban parks. The outbreak of the pandemic also altered the influence of other park features (e.g. park shape and trail density) on running intensity. The evidence-based knowledge provides planners with significant insights into pandemic-resilient park planning for the post-COVID era.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Objectives: Mining features of the Chinese public opinion of COVID-19, establishing an epidemic model, and providing a reference for the government's precise policy. Method(s): The concept of antifragility was introduced to analyze the public opinion of COVID-19 in China from the aspects of time, space and content. We used the public opinion data of the whole network (including Weibo, WeChat, web pages, government affairs and forums, etc.) as data sources. This paper analyzed the spatial and temporal correlation between the epidemic situation and public opinion, and incorporated the public opinion factor into the epidemic model for predictive analysis. Result(s): Based on the LDA topic model, a topic extraction and classification model was constructed, and seven firstlevel topics were extracted from COVID-19 related texts: outbreak report, research progress, prevention and control measures, sentiment, help information, donation information and the impact of the epidemic. The results showed that, in terms of content, mainstream media played an important role in epidemic science, prevention and control propaganda, and emotional guidance during the epidemic. Public emotions and concerns were generally positive and stable during the COVID-19; on the timeline with the emergence and spread of hot events, a small number of public opinion peaks have appeared, and netizens had a certain time specificity in the use of online media; spatially, the content of COVID-19 was mainly concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, BeijingTianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Wuhan. Conclusion(s): A certain correlation can be found between the virtual space represented by public opinion and the physical space represented by the number of confirmed outbreaks. There was a low number of confirmed diagnoses in areas where the outbreak was widely discussed. When the government faces public health emergencies, the results of public opinion analysis can provide empirical evidence for an agile response.},

   abstract = {Since school and business closures due to the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, urban parks have been a popular destination, offering spaces for daily fitness activities and an escape from the home environment. There is a need for evidence for parks and recreation departments and agencies to base decisions when adapting policies in response to the rapid change in demand and preferences during the pandemic. The application of social media data analytic techniques permits a qualitative and quantitative big-data approach to gain unobtrusive and prompt insights on how parks are valued. This study investigates how public values associated with NYC parks has shifted between pre- COVID (i.e., from March 2019 to February 2020) and post- COVID (i.e., from March 2020 to February 2021) through a social media microblogging platform -Twitter. A topic modeling technique for short text identified common traits of the changes in Twitter topics regarding impressions and values associated with the parks over two years. While the NYC lockdown resulted in much fewer social activities in parks, some parks continued to be valued for physical activity and nature contact during the pandemic. Concerns about people not keeping physical distance arose in parks where frequent human interactions and crowding seemed to cause a higher probability of the coronavirus transmission. This study demonstrates social media data could be used to capture park values and be specific per park. Results could inform park management during disruptions when use is altered and the needs of the public may be changing. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Method(s): Based on the epidemic data of COVID-19 openly accessed from national health authorities, we estimated the dynamic basic reproduction number R(0)(t) to evaluate the effects of the current COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in all the provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) as well as in Wuhan and the changes in infectivity of COVID-19 over time. Result(s): For the stability of the results, 24 provinces (municipality) with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, the R(0)(t) showed unstable trend with big variances. As the strengthening of the prevention and control strategies, R(0)(t) began to show a downward trend in late January, and became stable in February. By the time of data analysis, 18 provinces (municipality) (75%) had the R(0)(t)s less than 1. The results could be used for the decision making to free population floating conditionally. Conclusion(s): Dynamic R(0)(t) is useful in the evaluation of the change in infectivity of COVID-19, the prevention and control strategies for the COVID-19 outbreak have shown preliminary effects, if continues, it is expected to control the COVID-19 outbreak in China in near future.},

We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. The use of high-efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% credible interval (CrI): 73.1-85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0-92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. Our results also indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Objective: Study the impact of local policies on near-future hospitalization and mortality rates. Material(s) and Method(s): We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020, collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). Result(s): We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. Discussion(s): Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making. Conclusion(s): Our work is a timely effort to attempt to model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of local policies.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major public health crisis worldwide, and the Eastern Mediterranean is one of the most affected areas. Material(s) and Method(s): We use a data-driven approach to assess the characteristics, situation, prevalence, and current intervention actions of the COVID-19 pandemic. We establish a spatial model of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to project the trend and time distribution of the total confirmed cases and growth rate of daily confirmed cases based on the current intervention actions. Result(s): The results show that the number of daily confirmed cases, number of active cases, or growth rate of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are exhibiting a significant downward trend in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia under the current interventions, although the total number of confirmed cases and deaths is still increasing. However, it is predicted that the number of total confirmed cases and active cases in Iran and Iraq may continue to increase. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia will be largely contained if interventions are maintained or tightened. The future is not optimistic, and the intervention response must be further strengthened in Iran and Iraq. The aim of this study is to contribute to the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021 Huang, Ao, Han, Liu, Liu and Huang.},

Digital surveillance using data available online has increasingly become a trend with the advancement of the Internet. In this study, we assessed the predictive value of multiple online medical behavioral data, including online medical consultation (OMC), online medical appointment (OMA), and online medical search (OMS) for the regional outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen, China during January 1, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Multivariate vector autoregression models were used for the prediction. The results identified a novel predictor, OMC, which can forecast the disease trend up to 2 days ahead of the official reports of confirmed cases from the local health department. OMS data had relatively weaker predictive power than OMC in our model, and OMA data failed to predict the confirmed cases. This study highlights the importance of OMC data and has implication in providing evidence-based guidelines for local authorities to evaluate risks and allocate resources during the pandemic.

   abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 triggered the largest human-virus war in this century. Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others. Personal control measures are recognized as critical to providing a safe environment for patients and staff.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage and burden hospitals around the world. The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and was subsequently recognized by the World Health Organization as an international public health emergency and declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an unparalleled effect on all aspects of life., OBJECTIVE: With increasing total hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions, a better understanding of features related to patients with COVID-19 could help health care workers stratify patients based on the risk of developing a more severe case of COVID-19. Using predictive models, we strive to select the features that are most associated with more severe cases of COVID-19., METHODS: Over 3 million participants reported their potential symptoms of COVID-19, along with their comorbidities and demographic information, on a smartphone-based app. Using data from the >10,000 individuals who indicated that they had tested positive for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, we leveraged the Elastic Net regularized binary classifier to derive the predictors that are most correlated with users having a severe enough case of COVID-19 to seek treatment in a hospital setting. We then analyzed such features in relation to age and other demographics and their longitudinal trend., RESULTS: The most predictive features found include fever, use of immunosuppressant medication, use of a mobility aid, shortness of breath, and severe fatigue. Such features are age-related, and some are disproportionally high in minority populations., CONCLUSIONS: Predictors selected from the predictive models can be used to stratify patients into groups based on how much medical attention they are expected to require. This could help health care workers devote valuable resources to prevent the escalation of the disease in vulnerable populations.

Since the absence of medical resources or targeted therapeutics, systemic containment policies have been prioritized but some critics query what extent can they mitigate this pandemic. We construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement schedule and intensity of the containment policies on the spread of epidemic. Statistical evidences show the comprehensive identification and quarantine policies eminently contributed to reduce casualties during the phase of a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases in Wuhan and postponing or weakening such policies would undoubtedly exacerbate the epidemic. Hence we suggest that governments should swiftly execute the forceful public health interventions in the initial stage until the pandemic is blocked. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on PrEP prescriptions in the United States. Method(s): We analyzed data from a national pharmacy database from January 2017 through March 2021 to fit an interrupted time-series model that predicted PrEP prescriptions and new PrEP users had the pandemic not occurred. Observed PrEP prescriptions and new users were compared with those predicted by the model. Main outcomes were weekly numbers of PrEP prescriptions and new PrEP users based on a previously developed algorithm. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was quantified by computing rate ratios and percentage decreases between the observed and predicted counts during 15/3/2020-31/3/2021. Result(s): In the absence of the pandemic, our model predicted that there would have been 1 058 162 PrEP prescriptions during 15/3/2020-31/3/2021. We observed 825 239 PrEP prescriptions, a 22.0% reduction (95% CI: 19.1-24.8%) after the emergency declaration. The model predicted 167 720 new PrEP users during the same period; we observed 125 793 new PrEP users, a 25.0% reduction (95% CI: 20.9-28.9%). The COVID-19 impact was greater among younger persons and those with commercial insurance. The impact of the pandemic varied markedly across states. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted an increasing trend in PrEP prescriptions in the United States, highlighting the need for innovative interventions to maintain access to HIV-prevention services during similar emergencies.Copyright © 2022 Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Prosocial behavior (PSB) plays a critical role in everyday society, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. Understanding the underlying mechanism will provide insight and advance its implementation. According to the theory of PSB, social interaction, family and individual characters all contribute to its development. The current study aimed to investigate the influencing factor of PSB among Chinese college students during COVID-19 outbreak. This is an attempt to understand the mechanism of PSB and to provide a reference for the formulation of policies aimed at promoting healthy collaborative relationships for college students., Method: The online questionnaire was administered to 664 college students from 29 provinces of China via Credamo platform. There were 332 medical students and 332 non-medical students aged between 18 and 25 included for final study. The mediating role of positive emotion/affect (PA) and the moderating role of parental care in the association between social support and PSB during the pandemic of COVID-19 was explored by using Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), Prosocial Tendencies Measurement Scale (PTM), The Positive and Negative Affect (PANAS), as well as Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). The process macro model of SPSS was adopted for mediating and moderating analysis., Results: The results showed that social support positively predicted PSB among Chinese college students, even after adding PA as a mediation variable. PA during COVID-19 mediated the association between social support and PSB. PSB also revealed as a predictor of PA by regression analysis. Moreover, the moderating effect of parental care in the relationship between PA and PSB was detected., Conclusion: PA under stress acts as a mediator between social support and PSB. This mediating effect was moderated by PC in childhood. In addition, PSB was observed to predict PA reversely. The promoting factors and path between the variables of PSB are complex and need to be explored extensively. The underlying factors and process should be further investigated for the development of intervention plans. Copyright © 2023 Huang, Gan, Luo, Zhang, Ge, Fu and Chen.},

   abstract = {The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) 10th known Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak occurred between August 1, 2018 and June 25, 2020, and was the largest EVD outbreak in the country's history. During this outbreak, the DRC Ministry of Health initiated traveller health screening at points of control (POC, locations not on the border) and points of entry (POE) to minimize disease translocation via ground and air travel. We sought to develop a model-based approach that could be applied in future outbreaks to inform decisions for optimizing POC and POE placement, and allocation of resources more broadly, to mitigate the risk of disease translocation associated with ground-level population mobility. We applied a parameter-free mobility model, the radiation model, to estimate likelihood of ground travel between selected origin locations (including Beni, DRC) and surrounding population centres, based on population size and drive-time. We then performed a road network route analysis and included estimated population movement results to calculate the proportionate volume of travellers who would move along each road segment; this reflects the proportion of travellers that could be screened at a POC or POE. For Beni, the road segments estimated to have the highest proportion of travellers that could be screened were part of routes into Uganda and Rwanda. Conversely, road segments that were part of routes to other population centres within the DRC were estimated to have relatively lower proportions. We observed a posteriori that, in many instances, our results aligned with locations that were selected for actual POC or POE placement through more time-consuming methods. This study has demonstrated that mobility models and simple spatial techniques can help identify potential locations for health screening at newly placed POC or existing POE during public health emergencies based on expected movement patterns. Importantly, we have provided methods to estimate the proportionate volume of travellers that POC or POE screening measures would assess based on their location. This is critical information in outbreak situations when timely decisions must be made to implement public health interventions that reach the most individuals across a network.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Objective: Travel restrictions, physical distancing and quarantine requirements, lockdowns, and stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 have impacted abortion services across Canada. We aimed to explore the decision-making and care experiences of those who obtained abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic and understand recent abortion patients' perspectives on demedicalized models of medication abortion service delivery. Study design: We conducted 23 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women across Canada who obtained abortion care after March 15, 2020. We audio-recorded and transcribed the telephone/Skype/Zoom interviews and managed our data with ATLAS.ti. We analyzed the English-language interviews for content and themes using inductive and deductive techniques. Result(s): The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated economic and social support uncertainties, factored into many of our participants' decisions to obtain an abortion. Participants expressed relief and gratitude for being able to secure abortion care during the pandemic. Although women in our study reflected positively on their abortion care experiences, many felt that service delivery changes initiated because of the public health emergency exacerbated pre-COVID-19 barriers to care and contributed to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our participants expressed considerable enthusiasm for demedicalized models of medication abortion care, including telemedicine services and behind-the-counter availability of mifepristone/misoprostol. Conclusion(s): For our participants, abortion care constituted an essential health service. Our findings demonstrate the importance of continuing to provide access to safe, effective, and timely abortion care during public health emergencies. Exploring additional models of demedicalized medication abortion service delivery to address persistent access barriers in Canada is warranted. Implications: Policymakers and clinicians should consider patient experiences as well as clinical evidence when considering regulatory changes to facilitate access to abortion care during public health emergencies. Identifying a multitude of ways to offer a full range of abortion services, including demedicalized models of medication abortion care, has the potential to meet significant needs in the COVID-19 era and beyond. The COVID pandemic highlights the need for demedicalized models, not only for the sake of those seeking abortion care but also to ease the burden on medical professionals during public health emergencies.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, assessment of clinical skills courses through common methods including objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) became inadvisable. This article describes decisions made for first-, second-, and third-year veterinary students (n = 368) with respect to clinical skills at one US college.This includes the remote completion of a surgical skills curriculum using instructional videos and models and the delaying of laboratory sessions deemed impossible to deliver remotely. First- and third-year students were subsequently assessed using modified remote OSCEs. Second-year students were assessed using the standard surgical skills examination, video-recorded. All first- and third-year students successfully passed their OSCE upon either first attempt or remediation. Two second-year students failed their remediation examination and were offered additional faculty tutoring and another remediation attempt at the start of the fall semester.The remediation rate on the surgical skills examination was not different from that of previous years. One incident of suspected academic dishonesty occurred in the first-year OSCE. Students learned surgical skills successfully at home by practicing on models and receiving feedback of their skills on video recordings.While disappointing, one case of academic dishonesty among the 368 total students tested was not surprising. Remote assessment using modified OSCEs and surgical skills exams appears feasible and fair when in-person testing is not possible.Copyright © 2022 University of Toronto Press Inc..

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to be prepared for an infectious disease outbreak it is important to know what interventions will or will not have an impact on reducing the outbreak. While some interventions might have a greater effect in mitigating an outbreak, others might only have a minor effect but all interventions will have a cost in implementation. Estimating the effectiveness of an intervention can be done using computational modelling. In particular, comparing the results of model runs with an intervention in place to control runs where no interventions were used can help to determine what interventions will have the greatest effect on an outbreak. METHOD(S): To test the effects of a school closure policy on the spread of an infectious disease (in this case measles) we run simulations closing schools based on either the proximity of the town to the initial outbreak or the centrality of the town within the network of towns in the simulation. To do this we use a hybrid model that combines an agent-based model with an equation-based model. In our analysis, we use three measures to compare the effects of different intervention strategies: the total number of model runs leading to an outbreak, the total number of infected agents, and the geographic spread of outbreaks. RESULT(S): Our results show that closing down the schools in the town where an outbreak begins and the town with the highest in degree centrality provides the largest reduction in percent of runs leading to an outbreak as well as a reduction in the geographic spread of the outbreak compared to only closing down the town where the outbreak begins. Although closing down schools in the town with the closest proximity to the town where the outbreak begins also provides a reduction in the chance of an outbreak, we do not find the reduction to be as large as when the schools in the high in degree centrality town are closed. CONCLUSION(S): Thus we believe that focusing on high in degree centrality towns during an outbreak is important in reducing the overall size of an outbreak.},

   abstract = {In the United States, state governors initially enacted coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19)-mitigation policies with limited epidemiologic data. One prevailing legislative approach, from March to May 2020, was the implementation of "stay-at-home"(SAH) executive orders. Although social distancing was encouraged, SAH orders varied between states, and the associations between potential legal prosecution and COVID-19 outcomes are currently unknown. Here, we provide empirical evidence on how executive enforcement of movement restrictions may influence population health during an infectious disease outbreak. A generalized linear model with negative binomial regression family compared COVID-19 outcomes in states with law-enforceable stay-at-home (eSAH) orders versus those with unenforceable or no SAH orders (uSAH), controlling for demographic factors, socioeconomic influences, health comorbidities, and social distancing. COVID-19 incidence was less by 1.22 cases per day per capita in eSAH states compared with uSAH states (coefficient = -1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.83, -0.61; P < 0.001), and each subsequent day without an eSAH order was associated with a 0.03 incidence increase (coefficient = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.04; P < 0.001). Daily mortality was 1.96 less for eSAH states per capita (coefficient = -1.96, 95% CI: -3.25, -0.68; P = 0.004). Our findings suggest allowing the enforcement of public health violations, compared with community education alone, is predictive of improved COVID-19 outcomes.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

   abstract = {In recent years, as the COVID-19 global pandemic evolves, many unprecedented new patterns of epidemic transmission continue to emerge. Reducing the impact of negative information diffusion, calling for individuals to adopt immunization behaviors, and decreasing the infection risk are of great importance to maintain public health and safety. In this paper, we construct a coupled negative information-behavior-epidemic dynamics model by considering the influence of the individual's self-recognition ability and physical quality in multiplex networks. We introduce the Heaviside step function to explore the effect of decision-adoption process on the transmission for each layer, and assume the heterogeneity of the self-recognition ability and physical quality obey the Gaussian distribution. Then, we use the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) to describe the dynamic process and derive the epidemic threshold. Our findings suggest that increasing the clarification strength of mass media and enhancing individuals' self-recognition ability can facilitate the control of the epidemic. And, increasing physical quality can delay the epidemic outbreak and leads to suppress the scale of epidemic transmission. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the individuals in the information diffusion layer leads to a two-stage phase transition, while it leads to a continuous phase transition in the epidemic layer. Our results can provide favorable references for managers in controlling negative information, urging immunization behaviors and suppressing epidemics. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

   journal = {Infectious Disease Modelling},
   volume = {6},
   pages = {75-90},
   abstract = {Motivated by the need for robust models of the Covid-19 epidemic that adequately reflect the extreme heterogeneity of humans and society, this paper presents a novel framework that treats a population of N individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent individuals of different types and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that develops day by day, triggered by a seed infection introduced into the population on day 0. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to vary randomly within each type, with probability distributions that vary with their type. A formulation and analysis is given for a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infective-removed) network contagion model, considered as an agent based model, which focusses on the number of people of each type in each compartment each day. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large N limit for the stochastic state of the system on day t in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. The model can be implemented numerically for any number of types by a deterministic algorithm that efficiently incorporates the discrete Fourier transform. While the paper focusses on fundamental properties rather than far ranging applications, a concluding discussion addresses a number of domains, notably public awareness, infectious disease research and public health policy, where the IRSN framework may provide unique insights.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

   volume = {109},
   pages = {269-278},
   abstract = {Objective: Incorporating spatial analyses and online health information queries may be beneficial in understanding the role of Google relative search volume (RSV) data as a secondary public health surveillance tool during pandemics. This study identified coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clustering and defined the predictability performance of Google RSV models in clustered and non-clustered areas of the USA. Method(s): Getis-Ord General and local G statistics were used to identify monthly clustering patterns. Monthly country- and state-level correlations between new daily COVID-19 cases and Google RSVs were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and Poisson regression models for January-December 2020. Result(s): Huge clusters involving multiple states were found, which resulted from various control measures in each state. This demonstrates the importance of state-to-state coordination in implementing control measures to tackle the spread of outbreaks. Variability in Google RSV model performance was found among states and time periods, possibly suggesting the need to use different frameworks for Google RSV data in each state. Moreover, the sign of correlation can be utilized to understand public responses to control and preventive measures, as well as in communicating risk. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 Google RSV model accuracy in the USA may be influenced by COVID-19 transmission dynamics, policy-driven community awareness and past outbreak experiences.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

   journal = {Journal of Medical Internet Research},
   volume = {22},

   pages = {e19788},
   abstract = {Background: South Korea is among the best-performing countries in tackling the coronavirus pandemic by using mass drive-through testing, face mask use, and extensive social distancing. However, understanding the patterns of risk perception could also facilitate effective risk communication to minimize the impacts of disease spread during this crisis. Objective(s): We attempt to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions of COVID-19 in South Korea using internet search data. Method(s): Google Trends (GT) and NAVER relative search volumes (RSVs) data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in the Korean language and were retrieved according to time, gender, age groups, types of device, and location. Online queries were compared to the number of daily new COVID-19 cases and tests reported in the Kaggle open-access data set for the time period of December 5, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Time-lag correlations calculated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients were employed to assess whether correlations between new COVID-19 cases and internet searches were affected by time. We also constructed a prediction model of new COVID-19 cases using the number of COVID-19 cases, tests, and GT and NAVER RSVs in lag periods (of 1-3 days). Single and multiple regressions were employed using backward elimination and a variance inflation factor of <5. Result(s): The numbers of COVID-19-related queries in South Korea increased during local events including local transmission, approval of coronavirus test kits, implementation of coronavirus drive-through tests, a face mask shortage, and a widespread campaign for social distancing as well as during international events such as the announcement of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Online queries were also stronger in women (r=0.763-0.823; P<.001) and age groups <=29 years (r=0.726-0.821; P<.001), 30-44 years (r=0.701-0.826; P<.001), and >=50 years (r=0.706-0.725; P<.001). In terms of spatial distribution, internet search data were higher in affected areas. Moreover, greater correlations were found in mobile searches (r=0.704-0.804; P<.001) compared to those of desktop searches (r=0.705-0.717; P<.001), indicating changing behaviors in searching for online health information during the outbreak. These varied internet searches related to COVID-19 represented community health risk perceptions. In addition, as a country with a high number of coronavirus tests, results showed that adults perceived coronavirus test-related information as being more important than disease-related knowledge. Meanwhile, younger, and older age groups had different perceptions. Moreover, NAVER RSVs can potentially be used for health risk perception assessments and disease predictions. Adding COVID-19-related searches provided by NAVER could increase the performance of the model compared to that of the COVID-19 case-based model and potentially be used to predict epidemic curves. Conclusion(s): The use of both GT and NAVER RSVs to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions could be beneficial for targeting risk communication from several perspectives, including time, population characteristics, and location.Copyright ©Atina Husnayain, Eunha Shim, Anis Fuad, Emily Chia-Yu Su.

   abstract = {Aim: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) combined with public-access defibrillation has been shown to enhance overall survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This is one of top reasons of mortality across the globe. The COVID-19 global epidemic has modeled numerous problems for emergency medical services, along with reference of compression-only resuscitation also guidelines for comprehensive protective equipment. These suggestions and advice have created shortcomings and protracted fast response. On the other hand, the risk variables that determine the results of OHCA while the pandemic is ongoing are not well established. The main aim of our research remained to exploremedical features in addition results of OHCA individuals in Pakistan both before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. Method(s): The electronic medical records and paper records kept by EMS were utilized to compile the data for this single-center, retrospective observational analysis. The number of emergency hospital returns based on varying qualities in Sir Ganga Ram Hospitalized patients during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan were collected. Patients with OHCA who went to the emergency department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Lahore before the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2019 to March 2020) were identified. Result(s): Here were a total of 145 patients who participated in this study (80 males, or 58.2% of the total; mean [SD] age, 64.7 years); 64 among those individuals contributed in our currentresearch during the COVID-19 era, and 75 among those individuals contributed in our currentresearch before COVID-19 period. Bystander witnessing and method of chest compression was always the two general baseline features that were found to be substantially different between the two groups (p-values of less than 0.002 and less than 0.002, accordingly). Duringthe COVID-19 era, the ED ROSC was substantially lower than it had been before the COVID-19 period (25.68 percent vs 45.04 percent; adjusted odds ratio of 0.22; p-value less than 0.002) Survival to admission remainedsuggestivelyinferiorthroughout COVID-19 phase compared to the previous time period (26.01 percent vs 41.78 percent, accustomed odds ratio of 0.27, p-value of 0.006). On the other hand, there was no important statistically substantial difference in the 28-day survival rates (4.5% throughout COVID-19 era also 11.54% earlier COVID-19 period). Conclusion(s): Patients who had cardiac arrest outside of a hospital in Pakistan had a much lower chance of surviving long enough to be admitted during the COVID-19 epidemic that occurred there. In addition, the two groups' witness reactions and methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation couldn't have been more different from one another.Copyright © 2023, Anka Publishers.

   abstract = {A second wave of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Covid-19) cases is widely feared. In fact resurgence of cases has been clearly observed in several countries that had seen flattening of the epidemic curve. In general, relaxation of community control measures is almost always blamed for the resurgence of cases. In this letter, the author describes an immunological explanation for the double-peaked epidemic curve of new viral diseases including Covid-19. According to this hypothesis, a second wave of cases is due to the effective innate immunity in some of the population. These individuals may later develop clinical disease upon repeated exposure. This theory claims that a double-peaked pattern of new cases in a new viral epidemic is intrinsically determined by the pattern of pathogen interaction with the host. According to this hypothesis, relaxation of the community control measures is not responsible; at least in part, for resurgence of cases. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Ensuring the safety of healthcare workers is vital to overcome the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We here present an analysis of the social interactions between the healthcare workers at hospitals and nursing homes. Using data from an automated hand hygiene system, we inferred social interactions between healthcare workers to identify transmission paths of infection in hospitals and nursing homes. A majority of social interactions occurred in medication rooms and kitchens emphasising that health-care workers should be especially aware of following the infection prevention guidelines in these places. Using epidemiology simulations of disease at the locations, we found no need to quarantine all healthcare workers at work with a contagious colleague. Only 14.1% and 24.2% of the health-care workers in the hospitals and nursing homes are potentially infected when we disregard hand sanitization and assume the disease is very infectious. Based on our simulations, we observe a 41% and 26% reduction in the number of infected healthcare workers at the hospital and nursing home, when we assume that hand sanitization reduces the spread by 20% from people to people and 99% from people to objects. The analysis and results presented here forms a basis for future research to explore the potential of a fully automated contact tracing systems.Copyright: © 2021 Huttel et al.

   volume = {23},

   pages = {850},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Existing evidence highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a large reduction in healthcare utilization for routine and less-urgent services around the world including Korea. During the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed and foregone healthcare are driven by various factors, and risk perception, a complex psychological construct, is one of them. The aim of this study was to examine how COVID-19 risk perceptions influence delayed and foregone care during the pandemic in Korea. METHOD(S): The Koreans' Happiness Survey (KHS) 2020 was used to analyze responses from 13,491 individuals over 19 years of age residing in Korea. To assess delayed and foregone care, self-reported delayed or foregone care after the COVID-19 outbreak was used. COVID-19 risk perceptions were analyzed in terms of fear and severity of the pandemic based on responses from the participants. Logistic regression models, stratified by gender, were used to examine the relationship between COVID-19 risk perception and delayed/foregone healthcare. RESULT(S): Among the total 13,491 individuals included in the study, 4.0% (n=541) reported delayed and foregone care in 2020. The results showed that higher level of fear of COVID-19 was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting delayed and foregone care in Korean adults (OR=1.36, 95% CI=1.08-1.73). The gender-stratified model revealed that greater fear of COVID-19 was associated with higher odds of delayed and foregone healthcare (OR=1.71, 95%CI=1.23-2.39) among women while the perceived severity did not have any association. However, the perceived severity was associated with a higher likelihood of delayed and foregone care in men (OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.04-1.32), but no association was found between fear of COVID-19 and delayed and foregone healthcare in men. CONCLUSION(S): To ensure the timely use of any needed healthcare services, it is worth considering establishing policy interventions to mitigate unnecessary fear and worries about COVID-19. This can be achieved by providing accurate information on the virus, protective measures, and treatment.Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Background. Men who have sex with men (MSM) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at risk for multimorbidity as life expectancy increases. Simulation models can project population sizes and age distributions to assist with health policy planning. Methods. We populated the CEPAC-US model with CDC data to project the HIV epidemic among MSM in the United States. The PEARL model was predominantly informed by NA-ACCORD data (2009-2017). We compared projected population sizes and age distributions of MSM receiving ART (2021-2031) and investigated how parameters and assumptions affected results. Results. We projected an aging and increasing population of MSM on ART: CEPAC-US, mean age 48.6 (SD 13.7) years in 2021 versus 53.9 (SD 15.0) years in 2031; PEARL, 46.7 (SD 13.2) years versus 49.2 (SD 14.6) years. We projected 548 800 MSM on ART (147 020 >= 65 years) in 2031 (CEPAC-US) and 599 410 (113 400 >= 65 years) (PEARL). Compared with PEARL, CEPAC-US projected a smaller population of MSM on ART by 2031 and a slower increase in population size, driven by higher estimates of disengagement in care and mortality. Conclusions. Findings from two structurally distinct microsimulation models suggest that the MSM population receiving ART in the United States will increase and age over the next decade. Subgroup-specific data regarding engagement in care and mortality can improve projections and inform health care policy planning.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, with considerable public health and socioeconomic impacts that are seriously affecting health and safety of workers, as well as their employment stability. Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system.Copyright © 2021 Public Library of Science.

This study evaluates the response management relative efficiency of 58 countries in two stages, using two models. Material(s) and Method(s): Data envelopment analysis was applied for efficiency analysis. Result(s): 89.6% of countries were inefficient in pandemic control and 79% were inefficient in treatment measures. Sensitivity analysis underlines resources as a critical factor. Further examination points to absence of a robust and uniform mitigation measure against the pandemic in most countries. Conclusion(s): Preventing spread is not only the first line of defense; it is the only line of defense. The lack of a global public health database support system and uniform response compounded inefficiency. A robust pandemic response management framework is developed based on practices of key performers. Action plans are proposed, with a recommendation for a global public health pandemic database monitoring and support system as the nucleus.Copyright © 2021 Future Medicine Ltd.},

   abstract = {Monkeypox (Mpox) is a viral disease primarily affecting animals that can occasionally be transmitted to humans. While it can cause a rash and flu-like symptoms, it is generally less severe than smallpox. Awareness of the disease, proper preventive measures, and timely medical care are essential in managing and controlling Mpox outbreaks. We develop a new compartmentalized mathematical model to study the impact of intense awareness on the control and mitigation of the Mpox disease. The model captures the dynamics of humans and hosts (mammals) in transmitting Mpox disease while the human susceptible population was stratified into two subgroups of aware and unaware individuals. The model is analytically analyzed, and the simulation shows the prospect of an effective public awareness campaign program in reducing the cumulative incidence (new cases) of Mpox disease. Furthermore, the results suggest the need for consistency and continuous awareness program, adhering to public health measures to increase awareness of the Mpox disease.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)},

   journal = {Journal of medical Internet research},
   volume = {23},

   pages = {e23458},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model., METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables., RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791)., CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.

   title = {Mapping the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacy graduate students' wellness},
   journal = {Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes in pharmacy graduate students' (PhGS) lives. While pharmacy graduate programs across the U.S. have reported adjustments due to the pandemic, there is currently no data on the PhGS' wellness, and the impact on and extent to which offered supports and guidance has met PhGS needs. OBJECTIVE(S): This study's objectives were 1) to explore PhGS' perspectives on their challenges and the impact of these challenges on their wellness, and 2) to identify PhGS' suggestions for pharmacy graduate programs to improve guidance and support offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This study conducted semi-structured interviews based on the Objective, Reflective, Interpretative, Decisional (ORID) methodology. Pharmacy students working on completing a PhD in programs across the United States were invited to participate. All interviews were conducted using the Zoom platform between May and June 2020. Digital audio recordings were auto transcribed using the Trint platform. Thematic analysis was conducted using the six-dimensional model of wellness developed by Hettler as a guide, while open coding of the PhGS' suggestions was conducted inductively. RESULT(S): Thirteen PhGS across six universities in the U.S. were interviewed. During the pandemic, all six dimensions of the Wellness model were found to be challenged for PhGS. PhGS' challenges differed based on their laboratory-based vs. non-laboratory-based research settings. International PhGS reported differing challenges from domestic PhGS. PhGS also provided 18 practical suggestions for improving the teaching process and facilitating student's academic growth in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, graduate programs should continue developing a robust and tailored system to encourage and maintain mentorship programs to facilitate graduate students' successful path through their doctoral studies. Moreover, the suggestions offered by the PhGS participants in this study, when appropriately implemented, can also position graduate program success post-pandemic.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {At present, a large number of people worldwide have been infected by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). When the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic begins in a country, its impact is disastrous to both the country and its neighbors. In early 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was associated with global aviation. More recently, COVID-19 infections due to illegal or undocumented immigration have played a significant role in spreading the disease in Southeast Asia countries. Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 of all countries' border should be curbed. Many countries closed their borders to all nations, causing an unprecedented decline in global travel, especially cross-border travel. This restriction affects social and economic trade-offs. Therefore, immigration policies are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand and simulate the spread of the disease under different immigration conditions, we developed a novel mathematical model called the Legal immigration and Undocumented immigration from natural borders for Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized and Recovered people (LUSIHR). The purpose of the model was to simulate the number of infected people under various policies, including uncontrolled, fully controlled, and partially controlled countries. The infection rate was parameterized using the collected data from the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We demonstrated that the model possesses nonnegative solutions for favorable initial conditions. The analysis of numerical experiments showed that we could control the virus spread and maintain the number of infected people by increasing the control rate of undocumented immigration across the unprotected natural borders. Next, the obtained parameters were used to visualize the effect of the control rate on immigration at the natural border. Overall, the model was well-suited to explaining and building the simulation. The parameters were used to simulate the trends in the number of people infected from COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 Intarapanya et al.

   abstract = {Study objective: One in 4 deaths from COVID-19 has been attributed to hospital crowding. We simulated how many ambulances would be required to rebalance hospital load through systematic interhospital transfers. We assessed the potential feasibility of such a strategy and explored whether transfer requirement was a helpful measure and visualization of regional hospital crowding during COVID-19 surges. Method(s): Using data from the United States hospitals reporting occupancy to the Department of Health and Human Services from July 2020 to March 2022 and road network driving times, we estimated the number of ambulances required weekly to relieve overcapacity hospitals. Result(s): During the peak week, which ended on January 8, 2021, approximately 1,563 ambulances would be needed for 15,389 simulated patient transports, of which 6,530 (42%) transports involved a 1-way driving time of more than 3 hours. Transfer demands were dramatically lower during most other weeks, with the median week requiring only 134 ambulances (interquartile range, 84 to 295) and involving only 116 transports with 1-way driving times above 3 hours (interquartile range, 4 to 548). On average, receiving hospitals were larger and located in more rural areas than sending hospitals. Conclusion(s): This simulation demonstrated that for most weeks during the pandemic, ambulance availability and bed capacity were unlikely to have been the main impediments to rebalancing hospital loads. Our metric provided an immediately available and much more complete measure of hospital system strain than counts of hospital admissions alone.Copyright © 2022 American College of Emergency Physicians},

   pages = {423-438},
   abstract = {Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.

We defined a regional performance model based on maintaining sustainability indicators in the 240 EU regions. The objectives of the study are aimed primarily at a structured assessment of regional administrative capacity in the initial version, based on statistical indicators, and in the current version, after the outbreak of the pandemic, based on quantifying the impact of the disturbing factors. Secondly, the objectives of the study are to evaluate the reaction of the administrative units according to their ability to respond to the economic problems in the region, in the sense of improving the performance of the regional economies. The methods used in this paper will be empirical (the study of the specialized literature), analytical and will contain econometric modelling and statistical processing of the data. The results of the study will allow the identification of the necessary traits to train a leader in regional performance, traits that will be useful to European decision makers in adjusting the EU regional policy. Moreover, the need to redefine the EU in terms of performance will be substantiated once again.

After describing their essentials-some real examples are invoked-we discuss their main strengths and weaknesses. Then, on the basis of this analysis, we make a comparison between their respective merits concerning three different goals: prediction, explanation, and intervention. We argue that there are general considerations which could favour any of those sorts of models for obtaining the aforementioned goals. We conclude, however, that preference for particular models must be grounded case-by-case since additional contextual factors, as the peculiarities of the target population and the aims and expectations of policy-makers, cannot be overlooked.Copyright © 2021.

   abstract = {Introduction: Epidemiological models have been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, although performance evaluation has been limited. The objective of this work was to thoroughly evaluate a SEIR model used for the short-term (1 to 3 weeks) prediction of cases, quantifying its actual past performance, and its potential performance by optimizing the model parameters. Method(s): Daily case forecasts were obtained for the first wave of cases (July 31, 2020 to March 11, 2021) in the district of General Pueyrredon (Argentina), quantifying the model performance in terms of uncertainty, inaccuracy and imprecision. The evaluation was carried out with the original parameters of the model (used in the forecasts that were published), and also varying different parameters in order to identify optimal values. Result(s): The analysis of the model performance showed that alternative values of some parameters, and the correction of the input values using a "mov-ing average" filter to eliminate the weekly variations in the case reports, would have yielded better results. The model with the optimized parameters was able to reduce the uncertainty from almost 40% to less than 15%, with similar values of inaccuracy, and with slightly greater imprecision. Discussion(s): Simple epidemiological models, without large requirements for their implementation, can be very useful for making quick decisions in small cities or cities with limited resources, as long as the importance of their evaluation is taken into account and their scope and limitations are considered.Copyright © 2023, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas.

   abstract = {Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is a top-level public health concern. This paper attempts to identify the COVID-19 pandemic in Qom and Mazandaran provinces, Iran using spatial analysis approaches. This study was based on secondary data of confirmed cases and deaths from February 3, 2020, to late October 2021, in two Qom and Mazandaran provinces from hospitals and the website of the National Institute of Health. In this paper, three geographical models in ArcGIS 10.8.1 were utilized to analyze and evaluate COVID-19, including geographic weight regression (GWR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and spatial autocorrelation (Moran I). The results from this study indicate that the rate of scattering of confirmed cases for Qom province for the period was 44.25%, while the rate of dispersal of the deaths was 4.34%. Based on the GWR and OLS model, Moran's statistics demonstrated that confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered followed a clustering pattern during the study period. Moran's Z-score for all three indicators of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered was confirmed to be greater than 2.5 (95% confidence level) for both GWR and OLS models. The spatial distribution of indicators of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered based on the GWR model has been more scattered in the northwestern and southwestern cities of Qom province. Whereas the spatial distribution of the recoveries of the COVID-19 pandemic in Qom province was 61.7%, the central regions of this province had the highest spread of recoveries. The spatial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic from February 3, 2020, to October 2021 in Mazandaran province was 35.57%, of which 2.61% died, according to information published by the COVID-19 pandemic headquarters. Most confirmed cases and deaths are scattered in the north of this province. The ordinary least squares model results showed that the spatial dispersion of recovered people from the COVID-19 pandemic is more significant in the central and southern regions of Mazandaran province. The Z-score for the deaths Index is more significant than 14.314. The results obtained from this study and the information published by the National Headquarters for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic showed that tourism and pilgrimages are possible factors for the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Qom and Mazandaran provinces. The spatial information obtained from these modeling approaches could provide general insights to authorities and researchers for further targeted investigations and policies in similar circumcises.

   abstract = {This work is intended to examine the effects of Bangladesh's subtropical climate on coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. Secondary data for daily meteorological variables and COVID-19 cases from March 8 to May 31, 2020, were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). Distributed lag nonlinear models, Pearson's correlation coefficient and wavelet transform coherence were employed to appraise the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases. Significant coherence between meteorological variables and COVID-19 at various time-frequency bands has been identified in this work. The results showed that the minimum (MinT) and mean temperature, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and absolute humidity (AH) had a significant positive correlation while contact transmission had no direct association with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. When the MinT was 18 degreeC, the relative risk (RR) was the highest as 1.04 (95%CI 1.01-1.06) at lag day 11. For the WS, the highest RR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.07) at lag day 0, when the WS was 21 km/h. When RH was 46%, the highest RR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.98-1.01) at lag day 14. When AH was 23 g/m3, the highest RR was 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) at lag day 14. We found a profound effect of meteorological factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These results will assist policymakers to know the behavioral pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus against meteorological indicators and thus assist to devise an effective policy to fight against COVID-19 in Bangladesh.

   abstract = {Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Communications in nonlinear science & numerical simulation},
   volume = {88},

   abstract = {In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a new theta-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction theta of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.

   abstract = {Objective: This study retrospectively examined the health and social determinants of the COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries from a spatial epidemiological approach. Method(s): We used spatial analysis to examine the cross-national determinants of confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization official COVID-19 data and the World Bank Indicators of Interest to the COVID-19 outbreak. All models controlled for COVID-19 government measures. Result(s): The percentage of the population age between 15-64 years (Age15-64), percentage smokers (SmokTot.), and out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPExp) significantly explained global variation in the current COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries. The percentage population age group 15-64 and out of pocket expenditure were positively associated with COVID-19. Conversely, the percentage of the total population who smoke was inversely associated with COVID-19 at the global level. Conclusion(s): This study is timely and could serve as a potential geospatial guide to developing public health and epidemiological surveillance programs for the outbreak in multiple countries. Removal of catastrophic medical expenditure, smoking cessation, and observing public health guidelines will not only reduce illness related to COVID-19 but also prevent unecessary deaths.Copyright © 2020},

This cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2022, with the use of a self-administered mostly online survey. The BAT-12 scale was used to measure burnout, and the PSS-4 scale was used to measure stress. The sample was limited to 2196 individuals who worked with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of multivariate logistic regression models with three to nine predictors was estimated. The prevalence of burnout ranged from 27.7% in other nonmedical staff to 36.5% in nurses. Adjusting for age and gender, both physicians (p = 0.011) and nurses (p < 0.001) were at higher risk of burnout. In the final model, elevated stress most likely increased the risk of burnout (OR = 3.88; 95%CI <3.13-3.81>; p < 0,001). Other significant predictors of burnout included traumatic work-related experience (OR =1.91, p < 0.001), mobbing (OR = 1.83, p < 0.001) and higher workload than before the pandemic (OR = 1.41, p = 0.002). Only 7% of the respondents decided to use various forms of psychological support during the pandemic. The presented research can contribute to the effective planning and implementation of measures in the face of crisis when the workload continues to increase.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and to identify the correlates of the use of more and less effective contraceptive methods among Poles in the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional online study was conducted among the representative sample of 642 female respondents aged 18-49. Three groups of contraception choices (only effective methods-42.2%, mixed effective and ineffective methods-26.8%, none-31.0%) were distinguished and 11 potential determinants were considered. One in ten women declared having difficulty in accessing contraception during the first months of the pandemic. A multinomial logistic regression model explained 48.7% of the variation in contraceptive method choice. Both effective and ineffective methods were more often declared by young women, and less often in case of lower education, planning children or subjective no need for contraception. In addition, factors that reduced the chance of effective contraception were poor financial situation, already having children and a relatively higher degree of religiosity. The study confirmed that a significant share of Polish women do not opt for effective methods of contraception. Their choices had strong demographic, social and cultural determinants.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first wave of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began when the first index case was reported in Nigeria on the 27th of February 2020, and since then, more than 68,000 cases of the disease were confirmed, with 1173 deaths as of November 30, 2020., MAIN BODY: Daily situation reports from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control spanning February 27-November 30, 2020, were fully considered in this review. Further literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles related to response measures adopted by Nigeria. The instantaneous reproduction number (R) was then estimated as a metric to investigate the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Nigeria responded to COVID-19 pandemic by implementing anti-COVID-19 mitigation strategies in travel restrictions, social distancing, source control, contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine, as well as in clinical interventions. Our epidemiological model estimated the R-value of more than 1.0 in Nigeria and in each of all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory., CONCLUSION: Nigeria implemented containment and mitigation measures in response to the first wave of COVID-19 and these measures may have contributed to the mild COVID-19 outcome in Nigeria compared to the global trend. However, inadequate PCR testing capacity, lack or suboptimal utilization of epidemic metrics like the virus reproduction number (R) to inform decision making, and premature easing of lockdown measures among others were major challenges to the effective implementation of the COVID-19 response measures.

   title = {Lessons learned from three avian influenza simulation exercises in the southwest of France},
   journal = {Preventive Veterinary Medicine},
   volume = {201},
   pages = {105595},
   abstract = {The Southwest of France raises different species of poultry. These production activities present structural vulnerabilities to severe infectious diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Indeed, many farms have free-range flocks, multi-age and multi-species productions, while being located near wild bird migratory corridors. These factors may partly explain the H5 virus epidemics that occurred between 2015 and 2021. Their serious economic and technical consequences and psychological impact have generated solidarity, collective learning and operational cohesiveness among all poultry professionals. Consequently, a decision was made to conduct annual simulation exercises for a major health event in order to maintain a high level of vigilance and responsiveness within different poultry sectors. Three exercises took place, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, in semi-real conditions (real dates and compressed time) and according to different scenarios. They took place outside an epidemic context and have in common to focus on the initial phase of the crisis (suspicions, results of preliminary analyzes), which is critical to assess the reactivity of industry personnel in order to mitigate infectious disease spread. The preparation of the simulation exercises was based on a common methodology. They were created by an organizing team and each included up to 60 people (industry personnel, observers and auditors). These simulations highlighted several critical points: poultry professionals have detailed knowledge of the field, but this information can only be effectively obtained and used if there is already a poultry industry decision-making structure in place (with good networking); there is a need (1) for better information sharing within the industry; (2) to develop an assistance structure for producers directly involved in a crisis; and (3) to increase collaboration with State services in peacetime. Finally, several technical issues were raised regarding control zones; blocking poultry movements; production site quarantine; depopulation strategies; self-financing capacity of the poultry industry in the absence of governmental involvement; and enhanced mapping tools with real-time traceability of animal transportation.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {The world is restoring life balance after the global Covid-19 pandemic. This situation, giving birth to new problems, arose as an outcome of pre-and post pandemic scenarios. Healthcare system was under tremendous burden during this pandemic. Government bodies, scientists, drug discovery and drug registration were working in cooperation to fight the situation and to save lives. Out of all such activities, one healthcare domain is a key player, and that is the radiological department of hospitals. As discovery made those Covid-19 effects on lungs, the pressure on CT scan activities rose. To generate a CT scan quickly and to diagnose lung condition is the need of hour. Furthermore, that became a challenge for early detection of lung conditions. Hence, this paper presents the proposed research to develop iterative techniques using deep learning computation. Paper presents the proposed lung image acquisition and augmentation algorithm developed using a convolution neural network named "AquiCNN". This proposed algorithm will be useful for quick and enhanced lung CT image analysis.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases. Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major global public health challenge. This study aimed to investigate on how people perceive the COVID-19 outbreak using the components of the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and to find out how this might contribute to possible behavioral responses to the prevention and control of the disease. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran during March and April 2020. Participants were recruited via online applications using a number of platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram asking people to take part in the study. To collect data an electronic self-designed questionnaire based on the EPPM was used in order to measure the risk perception (efficacy, defensive responses, perceived treat) related to the COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to explore the data. RESULT(S): A total of 3727 individuals with a mean age (SD) of 37.0 (11.1) years participated in the study. The results revealed significant differences in efficacy, defensive responses and perceived treat among different population groups particularly among those aged 60 and over. Women had significantly higher scores than men on some aspects such as self-efficacy, reactance, and avoidance but men had higher perceived susceptibility scores compared to women. Overall 56.4% of participants were engaged in danger control (preventive behavior) while the remaining 43.6% were engaged in fear control (non-preventive behavior) process. CONCLUSION(S): More than half of all participants motivated by danger control. This indicated that more than half of participants had high perceived efficacy (i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy). Self-efficacy scores were significantly higher among participants who were older, female, single, lived in rural areas, and had good economic status. The results suggest that socioeconomic and demographic factors are the main determinants of the COVID-19 risk perception. Indeed, targeted interventions are essential for controlling the pandemic.},

   journal = {Biology},
   volume = {9},

   abstract = {As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the globe, people are debating policies to mitigate its severity. Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for COVID-19. We say a model is "simple" if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations. To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call "satellite" equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of an epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effects of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, death rates, and nursing homes and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our "slightly complex" Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. However, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have big impacts on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.},

It is now a global pandemic and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to explore the impact of elective-surgery deferment on the United States health-care system and subsequent recovery after COVID-19 containment. Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULT(S): Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment. CONCLUSION(S): The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system. As part of disaster mitigation, it is critical to start planning for recovery now.},

   abstract = {Network-based models are apt for understanding epidemic dynamics due to their inherent ability to model the heterogeneity of interactions in the contemporary world of intense human connectivity. We propose a framework to create a wire-frame that mimics the social contact network of the population in a geography by lacing it with demographic information. The framework results in a modular network with small-world topology that accommodates density variations and emulates human interactions in family, social, and work spaces. When loaded with suitable economic, social, and urban data shaping patterns of human connectance, the network emerges as a potent decision-making instrument for urban planners, demographers, and social scientists. We employ synthetic networks to experiment in a controlled environment and study the impact of zoning, density variations, and population mobility on the epidemic variables using a variant of the SEIR model. Our results reveal that these demographic factors have a characteristic influence on social contact patterns, manifesting as distinct epidemic dynamics. Subsequently, we present a real-world COVID-19 case study for three Indian states by creating corresponding surrogate social contact networks using available census data. The case study validates that the demography-laced modular contact network reduces errors in the estimates of epidemic variables.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, the new pandemic faced by the world, is a novel betacoronavirus causing severe respiratory coronavirus syndrome. Elderly patients, people with underlying chronic illnesses, cancer patients, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk and account for higher mortality rate. Unfortunately, there is no approved medication for treatment, till date, thereby supporting triage management and difficult decision-making. Thus, there should be a substantial increase in the palliative care in times of pandemic. There should be an increase in the availability of palliative care services in different care settings. Due to a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19, it has been reported on how palliative care is being delayed, discontinued, or deprioritized., AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers occurring in providing the palliative care to the patients with nonmalignant illness., METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire was designed after studying previous work over palliative care and pandemic crisis and was distributed among the physicians, surgeons, and the residents; a total of 95 health-care workers were involved. The survey was done through mails. The response then was evaluated and analyzed., RESULTS: As seen by the responses we got from the health-care workers, the main issue is the nonavailability of the personal protective equipment during this pandemic. Keeping the current scenario in mind, regarding COVID-19, the patients are at fear of coming to the hospital at first place, and even if they come then the fear of being alone haunts them. One of the biggest fears of the patient is dying alone, without being in contact with their loved ones., CONCLUSION: Palliative care should be an essential part of any health-care service in any humanitarian crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, effort should be made to remove the barriers and provide palliative care to the patient. Copyright: © 2020 Indian Journal of Palliative Care.},

   pages = {119679},
   abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a valuable approach for forecasting disease outbreaks in developed countries with a centralized sewage infrastructure. On the other hand, due to the absence of well-defined and systematic sewage networks, WBE is challenging to implement in developing countries like Bangladesh where most people live in rural areas. Identification of appropriate locations for rural Hotspot Based Sampling (HBS) and urban Drain Based Sampling (DBS) are critical to enable WBE based monitoring system. We investigated the best sampling locations from both urban and rural areas in Bangladesh after evaluating the sanitation infrastructure for forecasting COVID-19 prevalence. A total of 168 wastewater samples were collected from 14 districts of Bangladesh during each of the two peak pandemic seasons. RT-qPCR commercial kits were used to target ORF1ab and N genes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials was found in 98% (165/168) and 95% (160/168) wastewater samples in the first and second round sampling, respectively. Although wastewater effluents from both the marketplace and isolation center drains were found with the highest amount of genetic materials according to the mixed model, quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were also identified in the other four sampling sites. Hence, wastewater samples of the marketplace in rural areas and isolation centers in urban areas can be considered the appropriate sampling sites to detect contagion hotspots. This is the first complete study to detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic components in wastewater samples collected from rural and urban areas for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic. The results based on the study revealed a correlation between viral copy numbers in wastewater samples and SARS-CoV-2 positive cases reported by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) as part of the national surveillance program for COVID-19 prevention. The findings of this study will help in setting strategies and guidelines for the selection of appropriate sampling sites, which will facilitate in development of comprehensive wastewater-based epidemiological systems for surveillance of rural and urban areas of low-income countries with inadequate sewage infrastructure.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, sub-Saharan African countries experienced comparatively lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related deaths than in other parts of the world, the reasons for which remain unclear. Yet, there was also considerable variation between countries. Here, we explored potential drivers of this variation among 46 of the 47 WHO African region Member States in a cross-sectional study. We described five indicators of early COVID-19 spread and severity for each country as of 29 November 2020: delay in detection of the first case, length of the early epidemic growth period, cumulative and peak attack rates and crude case fatality ratio (CFR). We tested the influence of 13 pre-pandemic and pandemic response predictor variables on the country-level variation in the spread and severity indicators using multivariate statistics and regression analysis. We found that wealthier African countries, with larger tourism industries and older populations, had higher peak (p<0.001) and cumulative (p<0.001) attack rates, and lower CFRs (p=0.021). More urbanised countries also had higher attack rates (p<0.001 for both indicators). Countries applying more stringent early control policies experienced greater delay in detection of the first case (p<0.001), but the initial propagation of the virus was slower in relatively wealthy, touristic African countries (p=0.023). Careful and early implementation of strict government policies were likely pivotal to delaying the initial phase of the pandemic, but did not have much impact on other indicators of spread and severity. An over-reliance on disruptive containment measures in more resource-limited contexts is neither effective nor sustainable. We thus urge decision-makers to prioritise the reduction of resource-based health disparities, and surveillance and response capacities in particular, to ensure global resilience against future threats to public health and economic stability.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

   abstract = {We use a stochastic branching process model, structured by age and level of healthcare access, to look at the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 within a population. We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates among children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. A well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

   abstract = {This paper introduces new methods to analyze the changing progression of COVID-19 cases to deaths in different waves of the pandemic. First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state's COVID-19 time series into a first wave and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction of mortality, a factor of 16, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries and U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the United States, in which Northeastern states have been the most successful in the country. Such analysis may help European countries learn from each other's experiences and differing successes to develop the best policies to combat COVID-19 as a collective unit.},

   abstract = {There are limited published data within sub-Saharan Africa describing hospital pathways of COVID-19 patients hospitalized. These data are crucial for the parameterisation of epidemiological and cost models, and for planning purposes for the region. We evaluated COVID-19 hospital admissions from the South African national hospital surveillance system (DATCOV) during the first three COVID-19 waves between May 2020 and August 2021. We describe probabilities and admission into intensive care units (ICU), mechanical ventilation, death, and lengths of stay (LOS) in non-ICU and ICU care in public and private sectors. A log-binomial model was used to quantify mortality risk, ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation between time periods, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, health sector and province. There were 342,700 COVID-19-related hospital admissions during the study period. Risk of ICU admission was 16% lower during wave periods (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 0.84 [0.82-0.86]) compared to between-wave periods. Mechanical ventilation was more likely during a wave overall (aRR 1.18 [1.13-1.23]), but patterns between waves were inconsistent, while mortality risk in non-ICU and ICU were 39% (aRR 1.39 [1.35-1.43]) and 31% (aRR 1.31 [1.27-1.36]) higher during a wave, compared to between-wave periods, respectively. If patients had had the same probability of death during waves vs between-wave periods, we estimated approximately 24% [19%-30%] of deaths (19,600 [15,200-24,000]) would not have occurred over the study period. LOS differed by age (older patients stayed longer), ward type (ICU stays were longer than non-ICU) and death/recovery outcome (time to death was shorter in non-ICU); however, LOS remained similar between time periods. Healthcare capacity constraints as inferred by wave period have a large impact on in-hospital mortality. It is crucial for modelling health systems strain and budgets to consider how input parameters related to hospitalisation change during and between waves, especially in settings with severely constrained resources.

   abstract = {Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued emergence of major variant viruses has caused enormous damage worldwide by generating social and economic ripple effects, and the importance of PHSMs (Public Health and Social Measures) is being highlighted to cope with this severe situation. Accordingly, there has also been an increase in research related to a decision support system based on simulation approaches used as a basis for PHSMs. However, previous studies showed limitations impeding utilization as a decision support system for policy establishment and implementation, such as the failure to reflect changes in the effectiveness of PHSMs and the restriction to short-term forecasts. Therefore, this study proposes an LSTM-Autoencoder-based decision support system for establishing and implementing PHSMs. To overcome the limitations of existing studies, the proposed decision support system used a methodology for predicting the number of daily confirmed cases over multiple periods based on multiple output strategies and a methodology for rapidly identifying varies in policy effects based on anomaly detection. It was confirmed that the proposed decision support system demonstrated excellent performance compared to models used for time series analysis such as statistical models and deep learning models. In addition, we endeavored to increase the usability of the proposed decision support system by suggesting a transfer learning-based methodology that can efficiently reflect variations in policy effects. Finally, the decision support system proposed in this study provides a methodology that provides multi-period forecasts, identifying variations in policy effects, and efficiently reflects the effects of variation policies. It was intended to provide reasonable and realistic information for the establishment and implementation of PHSMs and, through this, to yield information expected to be highly useful, which had not been provided in the decision support systems presented in previous studies.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Cryptocurrency could redefine the interplay of Internet-connected world markets by eliminating constraints set by traditional local currencies and exchange rates. It has the potential to revolutionise digital markets through the use of duty-free trading. This study investigates the factors which influence the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM 3) during the COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic. Data were collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 357 Pakistani business-educated adults, including investors who had a rudimentary understanding of the technology and financial instruments. Partial least square (PLS)-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the developed theoretical framework based on the Technology acceptance model 3. The PLS model has explained 72.1% of what constitutes the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, risk was not a major consideration. This might be due to the fact that the majority of respondents thought working with cryptocurrency was hazardous. Willingness to handle cryptocurrency risk, on the other hand, might be a stumbling block to acceptance. The most essential aspect of a cryptocurrency's success was the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the moderating role of experience was not substantiated in this study. However, perceived usefulness was identified as a partial mediator of subjective norm and the perceived ease to use. This study contributed to the literature through the application of TAM 3 (an extension of the technology acceptance models) to investigate the fundamental qualities a cryptocurrency should have in order to influence investor's behavioural intention to use it. These findings provide revolutionary insights for the present and future market players for investment planning and for improved cryptocurrencies development.

   title = {Impact of weekday and weekend mobility and public policies on COVID-19 incidence and deaths across 76 large municipalities in Colombia: statistical analysis and simulation},
   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {22},
   number = {1},
   pages = {2460},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite widespread restrictions on residents' mobility to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled impact evaluations on such restrictions are rare. While Colombia imposed a National Lockdown, exceptions and additions created variations across municipalities and over time. METHODS: We analyzed how weekend and weekday mobility affected COVID-19 cases and deaths. Using GRANDATA from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) we examined movement in 76 Colombian municipalities, representing 60% of Colombia's population, from March 2, 2020 through October 31, 2020. We combined the mobility data with Colombia's National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) and other databases and simulated impacts on COVID-19 burden. RESULTS: During the study period, Colombians stayed at home more on weekends compared to weekdays. In highly dense municipalities, people moved less than in less dense municipalities. Overall, decreased movement was associated with significant reductions in COVID-19 cases and deaths two weeks later. If mobility had been reduced from the median to the threshold of the best quartile, we estimate that Colombia would have averted 17,145 cases and 1,209 deaths over 34.9 weeks, reductions of 1.63% and 3.91%, respectively. The effects of weekend mobility reductions (with 95% confidence intervals) were 6.40 (1.99-9.97) and 4.94 (1.33-19.72) times those of overall reductions for cases and deaths, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): We believe this is the first evaluation of day-of-the week mobility on COVID-19. Weekend behavior was likely riskier than weekday behavior due to larger gatherings and less social distancing or protective measures. Reducing or shifting such activities outdoors would reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {As SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a global threat in early 2020, China enacted rapid and strict lockdown orders to prevent introductions and suppress transmission. In contrast, the United States federal government did not enact national orders. State and local authorities were left to make rapid decisions based on limited case data and scientific information to protect their communities. To support local decision making in early 2020, we developed a model for estimating the probability of an undetected COVID-19 epidemic (epidemic risk) in each US county based on the epidemiological characteristics of the virus and the number of confirmed and suspected cases. As a retrospective analysis we included county-specific reproduction numbers and found that counties with only a single reported case by March 16, 2020 had a mean epidemic risk of 71% (95% CI: 52-83%), implying COVID-19 was already spreading widely by the first detected case. By that date, 15% of US counties covering 63% of the population had reported at least one case and had epidemic risk greater than 50%. We find that a 10% increase in model estimated epidemic risk for March 16 yields a 0.53 (95% CI: 0.49-0.58) increase in the log odds that the county reported at least two additional cases in the following week. The original epidemic risk estimates made on March 16, 2020 that assumed all counties had an effective reproduction number of 3.0 are highly correlated with our retrospective estimates (r = 0.99; p<0.001) but are less predictive of subsequent case increases (AIC difference of 93.3 and 100% weight in favor of the retrospective risk estimates). Given the low rates of testing and reporting early in the pandemic, taking action upon the detection of just one or a few cases may be prudent.Copyright: © 2023 Javan et al.

   volume = {211},
   pages = {144-148},
   abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the determinants of willingness to pay to enhance pandemic preparedness in Mauritius. Study design: A contingent valuation method is used to estimate willingness to pay to pay for enhancing pandemic preparedness using a sample of working people in Mauritius. Method(s): A two-phase decision process analysis is carried out to model the willingness to pay to enhance pandemic preparedness. The first phase is to analyse the respondents' decision of whether or not to pay for enhancing pandemic preparedness using a Probit model. The second phase is to estimate the determinants of the amount of money respondents are willing to pay using a Tobit model. Result(s): Income earners are willing to pay an average of Rs. 1,900 (approximately USD 50) per annum to enhance pandemic preparedness. 'Perceived Response Efficacy', 'Awareness of the Need and Responsibility for Paying', 'Subjective Obligation to Pay' and the 'Theory of Planned Behaviour' are found to affect both stages of of the decision-making process. Knowledge on COVID-19 is found to have a positive impact on the decision to pay and health responsibility attitude is found to have a negative impact on the amount people are willing to pay. Conclusion(s): On average, the government can potentially expect to mobilise an additional Rs. 1,047,470,000 (USD 27,565,000) from taxpayers to spend on enhancing pandemic preparedness in Mauritius. To increase willingness to pay for enhanced pandemic preparedness, the government can focus on improving knowledge on a pandemic, perceived response efficacy and awareness on need and responsibility of paying.Copyright © 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health},

The COVID-19 pandemic created a particularly difficult scenario for healthcare professionals (HCP) since the evidence base rapidly changed. In response, we established a freely accessible, video-based online resource, which was formally implemented requiring user registration. The guideline rapidly gained more than 4,500 registrants in the first wave alone, including nearly 100% of respiratory, intensive care or emergency unit consultants in Wales. During the first wave, there were nearly 170,000 page views with over 31,000 video plays and an average of 5.8 visits to the site per registrant. Acceptability using an online survey showed widespread support and that the unsubscribe rates were remarkably low. We suggest that this novel approach to guideline implementation achieved its aim of widespread engagement and acceptability and serves as a potential model for future medical guidelines and education beyond COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 The authors.},

   abstract = {Objectives:Gaps between recommended and actual levels of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use remain among MSM. Interventions can address these gaps but it is unknown how public health initiatives should invest prevention funds into these interventions to maximize their population impact. Design(s):We used a stochastic network-based HIV transmission model for MSM in the Atlanta area paired with an economic budget optimization model. Method(s):The model simulated MSM participating in up to three real-world PrEP cascade interventions designed to improve initiation, adherence, or persistence. The primary outcome was infections averted over 10 years. The budget optimization model identified the investment combination under different budgets that maximized this outcome, given intervention costs from a payer perspective. Result(s):From the base 15% PrEP coverage level, the three interventions could increase coverage to 27%, resulting in 12.3% of infections averted over 10 years. Uptake of each intervention was interdependent: maximal use of the adherence and persistence interventions depended on new PrEP users generated by the initiation intervention. As the budget increased, optimal investment involved a mixture of the initiation and persistence interventions but not the adherence intervention. If adherence intervention costs were halved, the optimal investment was roughly equal across interventions. Conclusion(s):Investments into the PrEP cascade through initiatives should account for the interactions of the interventions as they are collectively deployed. Given current intervention efficacy estimates, the total population impact of each intervention may be improved with greater total budgets or reduced intervention costs.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

   abstract = {Restricting in-person interactions is an important technique for limiting the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although early research found strong associations between cell phone mobility and infection spread during the initial outbreaks in the United States, it is unclear whether this relationship persists across locations and time. We propose an interpretable statistical model to identify spatiotemporal variation in the association between mobility and infection rates. Using 1 year of US county-level data, we found that sharp drops in mobility often coincided with declining infection rates in the most populous counties in spring 2020. However, the association varied considerably in other locations and across time. Our findings are sensitive to model flexibility, as more restrictive models average over local effects and mask much of the spatiotemporal variation. We conclude that mobility does not appear to be a reliable leading indicator of infection rates, which may have important policy implications.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Agricultural systems},
   volume = {190},
   pages = {103107},
   abstract = {CONTEXT: The rapid emergence of COVID-19 could have direct and indirect impacts on food production systems and livelihoods of farmers. From the farming perspective, disruption of critical input availability, supply chains and labor, influence crop management. Disruptions to food systems can affect (a) planting area; and (b) crop yields., OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impacts of COVID-19 on major cereal crop's production and their cascading impact on national economy and related policies., METHODS: We used the calibrated crop simulation model (DSSAT suite) to project the impact of potential changes in planting area and grain yield of four major cereal crops (i.e., rice, maize, sorghum, and millet) in Senegal and Burkina Faso in terms of yield, total production, crop value and contribution to agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). Appropriate data (i.e., weather, soil, crop, and management practices) for the specific agroecological zones were used as an input in the model., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulated yields for 2020 were then used to estimate crop production at country scale for the matrix of different scenarios of planting area and yield change (-15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10%). Depending on the scenario, changes in total production of four cereals combined at country levels varied from 1.47 M tons to 2.47 M tons in Senegal and 4.51 M tons to 7.52 M tons in Burkina Faso. The economic value of all four cereals under different scenarios ranged from $771 Million (M) to $1292 M in Senegal and from $1251 M to $2098 M in Burkina Faso. These estimated total crop values under different scenarios were compared with total agricultural GDP of the country (in 2019 terms which was $3995 M in Senegal and $3957 M in Burkina Faso) to assess the economic impact of the pandemic on major cereal grain production. Based on the scenarios, the impact on total agricultural GDP can change -7% to +6% in Senegal and - 8% to +9% in Burkina Faso., SIGNIFICANCE: Results obtained from this modeling exercise will be valuable to policymakers and end-to-end value chain practitioners to prepare and develop appropriate policies to cope or manage the impact of COVID-19 on food systems.

This article is based on contaminated water and human health to study the concept of the international image, the optimization path of China's international image, and the SEIR model. The SEIR model is one of the classic infectious disease models. Because the virus infection rate in this model is constant, it is difficult to accurately determine the spread of new coronary pneumonia. To model and complete the pandemic trend prediction and other issues, this article proposes a virus infection rate prediction method based on the long short-term memory network (LSTM), and combines it with the SEIR model to establish a new crown pneumonia pandemic trend prediction model (LS-Net). The conclusion of this article shows that in the fight against the novel coronavirus infectious pneumonia pandemic, the Chinese people have demonstrated the style of a big country. I have unreservedly passed on my own experience in pandemic prevention and control to countries around the world, and dispatched medical teams to provide the world with Chinese "prescriptions."Chinese diagnosis and treatment programs are the crystallization of common wisdom of Chinese medicine and Western medicine to support the world. All countries fight the pandemic together. In this analysis, Pakistan, Kenya, and Nigeria hold 84%, 85%, and 75% of China's positive views, respectively, 61% of Russians also have a positive attitude toward China.Copyright © 2022 Kaixi Ji et al.},

   abstract = {Expectations play important roles in consumers' purchase decisions. Among many types of expectations, consumers often form expectations on future market conditions when purchasing goods or services. This study develops a multiple-selves intertemporal choice model for such expectation-based purchase decisions, incorporating behavioral factors such as present-biased preferences into the model. An analysis based on the model shows that consumers adopt a threshold perception-perfect strategy when making purchase decisions and the threshold depends on values of model parameters that capture expectations on key market conditions. Different consumers often have different parameter values, leading to heterogeneous behavior. The study further applies the model to explain observations from medical service consumption data during the COVID-19 pandemic, and shows that the expectation-based purchase model provides a sound explanation for the observed heterogeneous purchase decisions across individuals with different incomes and health insurance status., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11002-022-09650-7.

   abstract = {Sudden, large-scale and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks of disease into widespread epidemics1-4. Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative. Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout mainland China. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations. This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

   abstract = {Major public health incidents such as COVID-19 typically have characteristics of being sudden, uncertain, and hazardous. If a government can effectively accumulate big data from various sources and use appropriate analytical methods, it may quickly respond to achieve optimal public health decisions, thereby ameliorating negative impacts from a public health incident and more quickly restoring normality. Although there are many reports and studies examining how to use big data for epidemic prevention, there is still a lack of an effective review and framework of the application of big data in the fight against major public health incidents such as COVID-19, which would be a helpful reference for governments. This paper provides clear information on the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as key big data resources, big data for the visualization of pandemic prevention and control, close contact screening, online public opinion monitoring, virus host analysis, and pandemic forecast evaluation. A framework is provided as a multidimensional reference for the effective use of big data analytics technology to prevent and control epidemics (or pandemics). The challenges and suggestions with respect to applying big data for fighting COVID-19 are also discussed.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Fangcang shelter hospitals, designated hospitals, and the time interval from illness onset to diagnosis toward the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic., METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures., RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%., CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.},

   journal = {Journal of cleaner production},
   volume = {279},
   pages = {123673},
   abstract = {Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) poses a significant threat to the population and urban sustainability worldwide. The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%-55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the COVID-19, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31-February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4-15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.},

   pages = {5425-5433},
   abstract = {New antiviral influenza treatments can effectively alleviate illness while reducing viral shedding. However, how such effects can translate into lower population infections of seasonal influenza in China remains unknown. To shed light on the public health impacts of novel antiviral agents for influenza, we constructed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the seasonal influenza epidemics in China. Two antivirus treatments, baloxavir and oseltamivir, were evaluated by estimating their impacts on the incidences of influenza infection in a single flu season. In the base-case analysis of a 10% antiviral treatment uptake rate, 2760 and 3420 per 10 000 persons contracted influenza under the treatment of baloxavir and oseltamivir, respectively. These incidence rates amounted to an 18.90% relative risk reduction (RRR) of infection associated with baloxavir in relation to oseltamivir. The corresponding RRR was 82.16% when the antiviral treatment uptake rate was increased to 35%. In addition, the peak of the prevalence of infected individuals per 10 000 persons under the baloxavir treatment was 177 (range: 93-274) fewer than that of oseltamivir. Our analyses suggest that the baloxavir treatment strategy reduces the incidence of influenza in China compared with oseltamivir in the setting of a seasonal flu epidemic. Also, increasing the uptake rate of antiviral treatment can potentially prevent millions of infections during a single flu season.Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

   abstract = {The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has caused significant damage to people's health and economics. Many works have leveraged machine learning models to facilitate the control and treatment of COVID-19. However, most of them focus on clinical medicine and few on understanding the spatial dynamics of the high-risk population for transmission of COVID-19 in real-world settings. This study aims to investigate the association between population features and COVID-19 transmission risk in Hong Kong, which can help guide the allocation of medical resources and the implementation of preventative measures to control the spread of the pandemic. First, we built machine learning models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on the population features of different tertiary planning units (TPUs). Then, we analyzed the distribution of cases and the prediction results to find specific characteristics of TPUs leading to large-scale outbreaks of COVID-19. We further evaluated the importance and influence of various population features on the prediction results using SHAP values to identify indicators for high-risk populations for COVID-19 transmission. The evaluation of COVID-19 cases and the TPU dataset in Hong Kong shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The top three most important indicators are identified as people in accommodation and food services, low income, and high population density.},

   journal = {HIV Medicine},
   volume = {20},
   number = {Supplement 9},
   pages = {35},
   abstract = {Purpose: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV infection. Modeling studies concluded that PrEP could eliminate HIV epidemic, once certain PrEP coverage levels are achieved. However, whether and how such coverage levels can be reached remains unknown. Here we address this issue. Method(s): We propose an innovative approach combining a compartmental model of HIV transmission at the population level, and a game-theoretic model for decision-making about PrEP at the individual level. Individuals at high-risk of HIV infection choose to use PrEP, or not to use PrEP, and undergo antiretroviral treatment (ART) if they acquire HIV, depending on the perceived risk of infection and relative cost of using PrEP, which includes price and access model of PrEP, consequences of being infected and lifelong ART, etc. We determine the conditions under which the voluntary use of PrEP could eliminate HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Parisian region of France. Result(s): We found that if PrEP offers high protection at low relative cost, HIV can be eliminated. For instance if PrEP effectiveness is 86%, as in the IPERGAY trial, PrEP coverage among high-risk MSM can reach 63% (IQR: 57%-67%), the minimum required for elimination, if individuals have a fair risk perception and the relative cost of using PrEP versus ART is sufficiently low. Drop of condom use among PrEP users does not play a major role against elimination while the risk perception does. Moreover, we found that epidemic elimination is only temporary. Conclusion(s): To reach PrEP coverage levels necessary to eliminate HIV, urgent efforts are needed to lower the cost of using PrEP. Furthermore, maintaining low cost for PrEP once the HIV epidemic is eliminated will be essential to sustain PrEP coverage levels and elimination in the long run.},

This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future., OBJECTIVE: In this study, a statistical approach was proposed to study the correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain and search data provided by Google Trends., METHODS: We assessed the linear correlation between Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain-which is dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III-regarding the number of COVID-19 cases reported with a certain time lag. These data enabled the identification of anticipatory patterns., RESULTS: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that by using our correlation test, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain up to 11 days in advance., CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. This can be of great help given the critical, if not dramatic need for complementary monitoring approaches that work on a population level and inform public health decisions in real time. This study of Google search patterns, which was motivated by the fears of individuals in the face of a pandemic, can be useful in anticipating the development of the pandemic.

   journal = {Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},
   volume = {104},
   pages = {101818},
   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most important health problems and global action plans have been proposed globally. Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The increase in gender-based violence in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health problem that needs to be addressed. Our study aimed to describe the satisfaction with a training program in gender violence victim's attention through simulated nursing video consultations, analyze the beliefs on gender violence in Mexican undergraduate nursing students, and understand the skills that need to be improved. A descriptive cross-sectional study using a mixed-method was carried out with 27 students using a validated satisfaction questionnaire (quantitative data) and conducting scripted interviews (qualitative data) analyzed through the interpretive paradigm. All nursing students expressed a high overall satisfaction with simulated nursing video consultations and positive perceptions about this training program. From the students' perceptions, three firstlevel categories and their related second-level and specific categories emerged: belief and myths, skills to improve, and learning improvements. A training program in gender violence victim's attention through simulated nursing video consultations, in the middle of a pandemic, was a satisfactory experience for nursing students and beneficial for them, as they gained new knowledge and socioemotional skills. This training program mainly improved the acquisition of communication and emotional management skills for an adequate gender violence victim's attention.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {810102},
   abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's stock price volatility during and after its initial outbreak, using time-series daily data covering the period from July to October, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Design/Methodology/Approach: In the estimation, the ARDL bounds test approach was employed to examine the existence of co-integration and the relationship of long-run and short-run between the new infection rates and stock price volatility, as stable and unstable variables are mixed. The inner-day and inter-day volatility, based on the Shanghai (securities) composite index, are estimated in separate empirical models. In addition, the Inter-bank overnight lending rate (IBOLR) is controlled in order to consider the effect of liquidity and investment cost. Findings and Implications: We find that in the initial year (2020) of the epidemic, the new infection rate is negatively correlated to stock prices in the short-term, whereas no significant evidence existed in the long-term, regardless of model specifications. However, after the epidemic's outbreak (2021), the result depicts that new infections increased stock prices in the long-term, and depressed its inner-day volatility in the short-term, which is inconsistent with most investigations. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that investors were more concerned about the withdrawal of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus, which were introduced to fight against the epidemic's impact on economy, than the epidemic itself. This study complements the limitations of most existing studies, which just focus on the period of the epidemic's outbreak, and provides insight into macroeconomic policy making in the era of the post COVID-19 epidemic such as the structural and ordered exit of the stimulating policies, intervention in IBOLR and balance social and economic sustainability.Copyright © 2022 Jin.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic poses a severe threat to public health. However, so far, there are no effective drugs for COVID-19. Transcriptomic changes and key genes related to Th2 cells in COVID-19 have not been reported. These genes play an important role in host interactions with SARS-COV-2 and may be used as promising target. We analyzed five COVID-19-associated GEO datasets (GSE157103, GSE152641, GSE171110, GSE152418, and GSE179627) using the xCell algorithm and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Results showed that 5 closely correlated modular genes to COVID-19 and Th2 cell enrichment levels, including purple, blue, pink, tan and turquoise, were intersected with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 648 shared genes were obtained. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that they were enriched in cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses after virus infection. The most significantly enriched pathway involved the regulation of viral life cycle. Three key genes, namely CCNB1, BUB1, and UBE2C, may clarify the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated with Th2 cells. 11 drug candidates were identified that could down-regulate three key genes using the cMAP database and demonstrated strong drugs binding energies aganist the three keygenes using molecular docking methods. BUB1, CCNB1 and UBE2C were identified key genes for COVID-19 and could be promising therapeutic targets. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose : Health systems' responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a surgical backlog of unknown size, limiting the ability to develop strategies to effectively address the backlog. We assessed the volume of deferred ophthalmic surgeries associated with the COVID-19 pandemic from March-December 2020 and suggested strategies and duration to clear the backlog in Ontario, Canada. Methods : Ontario Health Insurance Plan physician billing data from 2017-2020 were analyzed. The ophthalmic surgical backlog associated with the pandemic was estimated using time series forecasting models on training set (115 weeks), validation set (52 weeks) and forecasting set (42 weeks). Clearance time was calculated based on the queuing theory using various scenarios. Results : In 2020, there were 5.13 million ophthalmologist services, a reduction of 22% compared to the 6.60 million services in 2019. This included a 27% decrease in ophthalmic surgeries that require the use of operating rooms (OR) and a 6% decrease in anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injections (a common procedure for macular degeneration) that can be done in clinics. From March 16 to December 31, 2020 (a pandemic period), the estimated backlog in ophthalmic surgeries requiring an OR was 92,150 surgeries (95% prediction interval [PI] 71,288-112,841), increasing on average by 2,194 surgeries per week. Roughly 90% of the delayed surgeries were cataract surgeries and 4% were retinal detachment surgeries. Nearly half of the provincial backlog (48%, 44,542/92,150) involved patients from the West health region. Estimated provincial clearance time was 248 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI] 235-260) and 128 weeks (95% CI 121-134) if 10% and 20% of OR surgical capacity per week were added, respectively, based on the weekly ophthalmic surgical volume in 2019. Furthermore, an estimated 23,755 (95% PI 14,656-32,497) anti-VEGF injections were missed. Conclusions : The magnitude of ophthalmic surgical backlog in Ontario in 2020 alone raises serious concerns for meeting the ophthalmic surgical needs of patients. As the pandemic continues the accrued backlog size is likely increasing. Planning and actions are needed urgently to manage the collateral impact of the pandemic on the ophthalmic surgical backlog in Ontario.},

   abstract = {Key factors in modeling a pandemic and guiding policy-making include mortality rates associated with infections; the ability of government policies, medical systems, and society to adapt to the changing dynamics of a pandemic; and institutional and demographic characteristics affecting citizens' perceptions and behavioral responses to stringent policies. This paper traces the cross-country associations between COVID-19 mortality, policy interventions aimed at limiting social contact, and their interactions with institutional and demographic characteristics. We document that, with a lag, more stringent pandemic policies were associated with lower mortality growth rates. The association between stricter pandemic policies and lower future mortality growth is more pronounced in countries with a greater proportion of the elderly population and urban population, greater democratic freedoms, and larger international travel flows. Countries with greater policy stringency in place prior to the first death realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower durations to the first mortality peak. In contrast, countries with higher initial mobility saw higher peak mortality rates in the first phase of the pandemic, and countries with a larger elderly population, a greater share of employees in vulnerable occupations, and a higher level of democracy took longer to reach their peak mortalities. Our results suggest that policy interventions are effective at slowing the geometric pattern of mortality growth, reducing the peak mortality, and shortening the duration to the first peak. We also shed light on the importance of institutional and demographic characteristics in guiding policy-making for future waves of the pandemic. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

   abstract = {During the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments must make decisions based on a variety of information including estimations of infection spread, health care capacity, economic and psychosocial considerations. The disparate validity of current short-term forecasts of these factors is a major challenge to governments. By causally linking an established epidemiological spread model with dynamically evolving psychosocial variables, using Bayesian inference we estimate the strength and direction of these interactions for German and Danish data of disease spread, human mobility, and psychosocial factors based on the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO; N = 16,981). We demonstrate that the strength of cumulative influence of psychosocial variables on infection rates is of a similar magnitude as the influence of physical distancing. We further show that the efficacy of political interventions to contain the disease strongly depends on societal diversity, in particular group-specific sensitivity to affective risk perception. As a consequence, the model may assist in quantifying the effect and timing of interventions, forecasting future scenarios, and differentiating the impact on diverse groups as a function of their societal organization. Importantly, the careful handling of societal factors, including support to the more vulnerable groups, adds another direct instrument to the battery of political interventions fighting epidemic spread.

   abstract = {Background: The underlying health status of populations was a major determinant of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly obesity prevalence. Mexico was one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and its obesity prevalence is among the highest in the world. It is unknown by how much the COVID-19 burden could have been reduced if systemic actions had been implemented to reduce excess weight in Mexico before the onset of the pandemic. Method(s): Using a dynamic epidemic model based on nationwide data, we compare actual deaths with those under hypothetical scenarios assuming a lower body mass index in the Mexican population, as observed historically. We also model the number of deaths that would have been averted due to earlier implementation of front-of-pack warning labels or due to increases in taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and non-essential high-energy foods in Mexico. Finding(s): We estimate that 52.5% (95% prediction interval (PI) 43.2, 61.6%) of COVID-19 deaths were attributable to obesity for adults aged 20-64 and 23.8% (95% PI 18.7, 29.1%) for those aged 65 and over. Had the population BMI distribution remained as it was in 2000, 2006, or 2012, COVID-19 deaths would have been reduced by an expected 20.6% (95% PI 16.9, 24.6%), 9.9% (95% PI 7.3, 12.9%), or 6.9% (95% PI 4.5, 9.5%), respectively. If the food-labelling intervention introduced in 2020 had been introduced in 2018, an expected 6.2% (95% PI 5.2, 7.3%) of COVID-19 deaths would have been averted. If taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and high-energy foods had been doubled, trebled, or quadrupled in 2018, COVID-19 deaths would have been reduced by an expected 4.1% (95% PI 2.5, 5.7%), 7.9% (95% PI 4.9, 11.0%), or 11.6% (95% PI 7.3, 15.8%), respectively. Interpretation(s): Public health interventions targeting underlying population health, including non-communicable chronic diseases, is a promising line of action for pandemic preparedness that should be included in all pandemic plans.

The "what" and the "why" of these changes represent fundamental research questions to provide timely and effective tools to manage the evolution of the epidemic. Answers to such questions need appropriate statistical models and visualization tools. Here, we give an overview of the role played by Statgroup-19, an independent Italian research group born in March 2020. The group includes seven statisticians from different Italian universities, each with different backgrounds but with a shared interest in data analysis, statistical modeling, and biostatistics. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the group has interacted with authorities and journalists to support policy decisions and inform the general public about the evolution of the epidemic. This collaboration led to several scientific papers and an accrued visibility across various media, all made possible by the continuous interaction across the group members that shared their unique expertise.

Traditional compartmental epidemiological models demonstrated limited ability to predict the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in different countries. In order to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior, we turn to chaotic dynamics, which proved fruitful in analyzing previous diseases such as measles. We hypothesize that the unpredictability of the pandemic could be a fundamental property if the disease spread is a chaotic dynamical system. Our mathematical examination of COVID-19 epidemic data in different countries reveals similarity of this dynamic to the chaotic behavior of many dynamics systems, such as logistic maps. We conclude that the data does suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates chaotic behavior, which should be taken into account by public policy makers. Furthermore, the scale and behavior of the epidemic may be essentially unpredictable due to the properties of chaotic systems, rather than due to the limited data available for model parameterization.

   abstract = {During the pandemic outdoor activities were encouraged to mitigate transmission risk while providing safe spaces for social interactions. Human behaviour, which may favour or disfavour, contact rates between questing ticks and humans, is a key factor impacting tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) incidence. We analyzed annual and weekly TBE cases in Finland, Norway and Sweden from 2010 to 2021 to assess trend, seasonality, and discuss changes in human tick exposure imposed by COVID-19. We compared the pre-pandemic incidence (2010-2019) with the pandemic incidence (2020-2021) by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) to incidence data. Pre-pandemic incidence was 1.0, 0.29 and 2.8 for Finland, Norway and Sweden, respectively, compared to incidence of 2.2, 1.0 and 3.9 during the pandemic years. However, there was an increasing trend for all countries across the whole study period. Therefore, we predicted the number of cases in 2020/2021based on a model fitted to the annual cases in 2010-2019. The incidences during the pandemic were 1.3 times higher for Finland, 1.7 times higher for Norway and no difference for Sweden. When social restrictions were enforced to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 there were profound changes in outdoor recreational behavior. Future consideration of public health interventions that promote outdoor activities may increase exposure to vector-borne diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) offers a complementary tool for clinical surveillance to detect and monitor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can shed the virus through the fecal route, WBS has the potential to measure community prevalence of COVID-19 without restrictions from healthcare-seeking behaviours and clinical testing capacity. During the Omicron wave, the limited capacity of clinical testing to identify COVID-19 cases in many jurisdictions highlighted the utility of WBS to estimate disease prevalence and inform public health strategies; however, there is a plethora of in-sewage, environmental and laboratory factors that can influence WBS outcomes. The implementation of WBS, therefore, requires a comprehensive framework to outline a pipeline that accounts for these complex and nuanced factors. This article reviews the framework of the national WBS conducted at the Public Health Agency of Canada to present WBS methods used in Canada to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we focus on five Canadian cities-Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax-whose wastewater signals are analyzed by a mathematical model to provide case forecasts and reproduction number estimates. The goal of this work is to share our insights on approaches to implement WBS. Importantly, the national WBS system has implications beyond COVID-19, as a similar framework can be applied to monitor other infectious disease pathogens or antimicrobial resistance in the community.},

They are considered emerging public health threats throughout the world, including Europe. Therefore, public health authorities must be prepared by quantifying the potential magnitude of virus transmission and the effectiveness of interventions. Methodology We developed a mathematical model with a vector-host structure for chikungunya virus transmission and estimated model parameters from epidemiological data of the two main autochthonous chikungunya virus transmission events that occurred in Southern France, in Montpellier (2014) and in Le Cannet-des-Maures (2017). We then performed simulations of the model using these estimates to forecast the magnitude of the foci of transmission as a function of the response delay and the moment of virus introduction. Conclusions The results of the different simulations underline the relative importance of each variable and can be useful to stakeholders when designing context-based intervention strategies. The findings emphasize the importance of, and advocate for early detection of imported cases and timely biological confirmation of autochthonous cases to ensure timely vector control measures, supporting the implementation and the maintenance of sustainable surveillance systems.Copyright © 2022 Jourdain et al.},

   title = {Towards harmonisation of entomological surveillance in the mediterranean area},
   journal = {PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases},
   volume = {13},
   number = {6},
   pages = {e0007314},
   abstract = {Background The Mediterranean Basin is historically a hotspot for trade, transport, and migration. As a result, countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea share common public health threats. Among them are vector-borne diseases, and in particular, mosquito-borne viral diseases are prime candidates as (re)emerging diseases and are likely to spread across the area. Improving preparedness and response capacities to these threats at the regional level is therefore a major issue. The implementation of entomological surveillance is, in particular, of utmost importance. Guidance in designing entomological surveillance systems is critical, and these systems may pursue different specific objectives depending on the disease. The purpose of the proposed review is to draw up guidelines for designing effective and sustainable entomological surveillance systems in order to improve preparedness and response. However, we make it clear that there is no universal surveillance system, so the thinking behind harmonisation is to define evidence-based standards in order to promote best practises, identify the most appropriate surveillance activities, and optimise the use of resources. Such guidance is aimed at policymakers and diverse stakeholders and is intended to be used as a framework for the implementation of entomological surveillance programmes. It will also be useful to collaborate and share information with health professionals involved in other areas of disease surveillance. Medical entomologists and vector control professionals will be able to refer to this report to advocate for tailored entomological surveillance strategies. The main threats targeted in this review are the vectors of dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. The vectors of all these arboviruses are mosquitoes. Methods Current knowledge on vector surveillance in the Mediterranean area is reviewed. The analysis was carried out by a collaboration of the medical entomology experts in the region, all of whom belong to the MediLabSecure network, which is currently funded by the European Union and represents an international effort encompassing 19 countries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea region. Findings Robust surveillance systems are required to address the globalisation of emerging arboviruses. The prevention and management of mosquito-borne viral diseases must be addressed in the prism of a One Health strategy that includes entomological surveillance as an integral part of the policy. Entomological surveillance systems should be designed according to the entomological and epidemiological context and must have well-defined objectives in order to effect a tailored and graduated response. We therefore rely on different scenarios according to different entomological and epidemiological contexts and set out detailed objectives of surveillance. The development of multidisciplinary networks involving both academics and public authorities will provide resources to address these health challenges by promoting good practises in surveillance (identification of surveillance aims, design of surveillance systems, data collection, dissemination of surveillance results, evaluation of surveillance activities) and through the sharing of effective knowledge and information. These networks will also contribute to capacity building and stronger collaborations between sectors at both the local and regional levels. Finally, concrete guidance is offered on the vector of the main arbovirus based on the current situation in the area.Copyright © 2019 Jourdain et al.},

   abstract = {Background and Aims: Alcohol consumption increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in the United States. We projected the effect of increased alcohol consumption on alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and mortality. Approach and Results: We extended a previously validated microsimulation model that estimated the short- and long-term effect of increased drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals in the United States born between 1920 and 2012. We modeled short- and long-term outcomes of current drinking patterns during COVID-19 (status quo) using survey data of changes in alcohol consumption in a nationally representative sample between February and November 2020. We compared these outcomes with a counterfactual scenario wherein no COVID-19 occurs and drinking patterns do not change. One-year increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to result in 8000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7500-8600) additional ALD-related deaths, 18,700 (95% UI, 17,600-19,900) cases of decompensated cirrhosis, and 1000 (95% UI, 1000-1100) cases of HCC, and 8.9 million disability-adjusted life years between 2020 and 2040. Between 2020 and 2023, alcohol consumption changes due to COVID-19 will lead to 100 (100-200) additional deaths and 2800 (2700-2900) additional decompensated cirrhosis cases. A sustained increase in alcohol consumption for more than 1 year could result in additional morbidity and mortality. Conclusion(s): A short-term increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic can substantially increase long-term ALD-related morbidity and mortality. Our findings highlight the need for individuals and policymakers to make informed decisions to mitigate the impact of high-risk alcohol drinking in the United States.Copyright © 2021 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

First, we focus on short-term forecasting for the number of new confirmed cases and severe cases. Second, we focus on understanding how much of the current infections has been affected by external influx from neighborhood areas or internal transmission within the area. This understanding may be important because it is linked to the government policy determining non-pharmaceutical interventions. To obtain the decomposition of the effect, districts of Seoul should be considered simultaneously, and multivariate time series models are used. Third, we focus on predicting the number of new weekly confirmed cases for each district in Seoul. This detailed prediction may be important to the government policy on resource allocation. We consider an ensemble method to overcome poor prediction performance of simple models.

The COVID-19 testing station, Ewha Safe Station, is the core element of ESC. Symptomatic students and faculty members perform a combo swab self-PCR test or receive a nasopharyngeal swab PCR test from experts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through early detection and management. ESC is significant in that it detects infection risks and proactively implements preemptive measures in a university. The COVID-19 health response system model at the university level was applied for the first time in South Korea, reaching a milestone in the history of university health in South Korea. In particular, it is highly valuable that the test was free of charge, as it enabled all of the examinees to have easy access to the test through joint cooperation with the Seegene Medical Foundation. This is a successful example of cooperation between schools and private institutions for public health improvement. In the future, the direct and indirect effects of the establishment and implementation of ESC need to be evaluated and confirmed, and areas requiring improvements need to be identified in preparation for another infectious disease outbreak in the future.Copyright © 2022 Ewha Womans University College of Medicine and Ewha Medical Research Institute.},

   pages = {1-19},
   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to rapid and unexpected changes across the world, particularly in road safety. Thus, this work assesses the impact of COVID-19 accompanied by government preventive policies on road safety in Saudi Arabia by investigating the crash frequency and crash rates. A 4-year crash dataset relating to 2018-2021 was collected, covering about 71,000 km in total road length. It covers all intercity roads and some of the major intercity roads in Saudi Arabia with over 40,000 data logs of involved crashes. We considered three different time phases to observe road safety. These time phases were identified by the duration of government curfew measures against COVID-19 (before, during, and after). The crash frequency analysis showed that the curfew during COVID-19 significantly impacted the crash reduction. At a national level, the crash frequency decreased during 2020 and reached a 33.2% reduction compared to 2019 (the previous year), and it surprisingly continued decreasing in 2021 (the consequent year) to another 37.7% reduction although the government measures were lifted. Moreover, considering the traffic volume and road geometry, we analyzed crash rates for 36 selected segments, and the results showed a significant reduction in the crash rate before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, a random effect negative binomial model was developed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that the reduction in crashes was significant during and after COVID-19. Also, single roads (two-lane, two-way) were found to be more dangerous than other types of roads.

   abstract = {Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently emerged as a global threat and a significant public health issue. The role of simulation-based training (SBT) during such a pandemic becomes more relevant for teaching a team approach and building capacity especially when there is a threat to health care workers due to aerosol generation and there is a huge demand for manpower during the pandemic. Objective To assess the effectiveness of a simulation-based training program in improving knowledge and concept of teamwork of health care workers involved in airway management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods After institutional review committee approval, a prospective analytical study was conducted in the department of medical education on participants from various specialties undergoing COVID-19 airway training. The purpose of the study was to assess team dynamics during simulation scenarios and compare test scores at baseline, immediately post-training, and seven days post-training (using online forms). Scores were compared using the Friedman test followed by post-hoc testing. Sub-group comparison was done using an unpaired t-test. Results Median scores were significantly higher in the immediate post-training test and seven days post-training test (online) compared to baseline pretest scores in the overall participant group and in individual sub-groups. There was no significant difference in immediate versus seven-day post-training test scores overall and in all subgroups. In the sub-group comparisons, median improvement in score was significantly better in the non-anesthesia group and in the resident group. It was observed that team performance in terms of role clarity, closed-loop communication, and idea acceptance improved substantially during the subsequent scenarios. Conclusion Simulation-based training was effective in improving knowledge and team dynamics amongst health care workers regarding airway management in COVID-19 patients, with retention of up to one week. Similar future research can be planned for the affective and psychomotor domains. Copyright © 2021, Kabi et al.},

   journal = {Royal Society open science},
   volume = {7},
   number = {9},
   pages = {201095},
   abstract = {The unprecedented global spread of COVID-19 has prompted dramatic public-health measures like strict stay-at-home orders and economic shutdowns. Some governments have resisted such measures in the hope that naturally acquired shield immunity could slow the spread of the virus. In the absence of empirical data about the effectiveness of these measures, policymakers must turn to epidemiological modelling to evaluate options for responding to the pandemic. This paper combines compartmental epidemiological models with the concept of behavioural dynamics from evolutionary game theory (EGT). This innovation allows us to model how compliance with an economic lockdown might wane over time, as individuals weigh the risk of infection against the certainty of the economic cost of staying at home. Governments can, however, increase spending on social programmes to mitigate the cost of a shutdown. Numerical analysis of our model suggests that emergency-relief funds spent at the individual level are effective in reducing the duration and overall economic cost of a pandemic. We also find that shield immunity takes hold in a population most easily when a lockdown is enacted with relatively low costs to the individual. Our qualitative analysis of a complex model provides evidence that the effects of shield immunity and economic shutdowns are complementary, such that governments should pursue them in tandem.

   abstract = {Background: The African continent is known for high entrepreneurial activity, especially in the agricultural sector. Despite this, the continent's economic development is below expectations, due to numerous factors constraining the growth and sustainability of agricultural SMEs. These constraints have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to understand the pathways through which the pandemic affected agri-SMEs, with specific focus on assessing the differentiated effects arising from the size of the agri-SME and the gender of the owner-manager., Methods: Data was collected from over 100 agri-SMEs, ranging in size from sole proprietorships with one employee to agri-SMEs employing up to 100 people, in six African countries. Mixed methods were used to analyse the data with changes in business operations arising from changing market access, regimented health and safety guidelines and constrained labour supply assessed using visualisations and descriptive statistics. Logistic regression modelling was employed to determine the set of variables contributing to agri-SME business downturn during the COVID-19 pandemic., Results: All surveyed agri-SMEs were negatively affected by COVID-19-associated restrictions with the size of the firm and gender of the owner-managers resulting in differentiated impacts. The smallest agri-SMEs, mainly owner-managed by women, were more likely to experience disruptions in marketing their goods and maintaining their labour supply. Larger agri-SMEs made changes to their business operations to comply with government guidelines during the pandemic and made investments to manage their labour supply, thus sustaining their business operations. In addition, logistic regression modelling results show that financing prior to the pandemic, engaging in primary agricultural production, and being further from urban centres significantly influenced the likelihood of a firm incurring business losses., Conclusions: These findings necessitate engendered multi-faceted agri-SME support packages that are tailored for smaller-sized agri-SMEs. Any such support package should include support for agri-SMEs to develop sustainable marketing strategies and help them secure flexible financing that considers payment deferrals and debt moratorium during bona fide market shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

   abstract = {Public health practitioners require measures to evaluate how vulnerable populations are to diseases, especially for zoonoses (i.e. diseases transmitted from animals to humans) given their pandemic potential. These measures would be valuable to support strategic and operational decision making and allocation of resources. Although vulnerability is well defined for natural hazards, for public health threats the concept remains undetermined. Here, we develop new methodologies to: (i) quantify the impact of zoonotic diseases and the capacity of countries to cope with these diseases, and (ii) combine these two measures (impact and capacity) into one overall vulnerability indicator. The adaptive capacity is calculated from estimations of disease mortality, although the method can be adapted for diseases with no or low mortality but high morbidity. As an example, we focused on the vulnerability of Nigeria and Sierra Leone to Lassa Fever and Ebola. We develop a simple analytical form that can be used to estimate vulnerability scores for different spatial units of interest, e.g. countries or regions. We show how some populations can be highly vulnerable despite low impact threats. We finally outline future research to more comprehensively inform vulnerability with the incorporation of relevant factors depicting local heterogeneities (e.g. bio-physical and socio-economic factors).

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%-30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed.},

   pages = {110547},
   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected all countries in the world. The aim of this study is to examine the potential advantages of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19, which are the three main variables of interest. This paper contributes to the literature on forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in several ways. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to calculate the optimal parameters of SSA including window length and the number of leading components. Secondly, the results of two forecasting approaches in the SSA, namely vector and recurrent forecasting, are compared to those from other commonly used time series forecasting techniques. These include Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Fractional ARIMA (ARFIMA), Exponential Smoothing, TBATS, and Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR). Thirdly, the best forecasting model is chosen based on the accuracy measure Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and it is applied to forecast 40 days ahead. These forecasts can help us to predict the future behaviour of this disease and make better decisions. The dataset of Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University is adopted to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for top ten affected countries until October 29, 2020. The findings of this investigation show that no single model can provide the best model for any of the countries and forecasting horizons considered here. However, the SSA technique is found to be viable option for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19 based on the number of times that it outperforms the competing models.

   abstract = {Background: Infectious diseases are disorders caused by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They are normally harmless or even helpful. However under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease. Infectious diseases are also called contagious diseases due to the fact that they can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by insects or other animals. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has "pervaded" the whole world during the last three years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern., Methods: In this paper, we will study the outbreak of this pandemic in Albania based on some mathematical models, such as SIR, SIRD, and SEIRD. We will present a detailed analysis of these models and also demonstrate how they can be used to predict the spread of infectious diseases. More precisely, we will see the spread of COVID-19 in our country, Albania. Software such as MATLAB and RStudio will be used to do this. The data that we will use when working with these programs is taken from the Institute of Public Health, Tirana, Albania., Results: We've developed an application utilizing actual data to estimate SEIRD model parameters. It's able to compute the basic reproduction number and, more significantly, provides forecasts on the disease's progression., Conclusions: Our aim is to calculate the Basic Reproduction Number, using the Next Generation Matrix, and use it to see the future of the disease. This is the average number of new infections generated by an infected individual. A large value indicates that the infection is transmitted very quickly. We will try to calculate what the values of Basic Number Reproduction have been over different time periods.},

Since the discovery of ebolavirus in 1976, the 2014-2016 epidemics have been the worst with significant case fatality rates and socioeconomic impact in the affected countries. This review looks at important health determinants that directly accounted for the spatial events of rapid spread and severity of EVD in West Africa, with consequent high fatality rates.

   abstract = {Rationale: Conspiracy endorsement is a public health challenge for the successful containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. While usually considered a societal phenomenon, little is known about the equally important developmental backdrops and personality characteristics like mistrust that render an individual prone to conspiracy endorsement. There is a growing body of evidence implying a detrimental role of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) - a highly prevalent developmental burden - in the development of epistemic trust and personality functioning. This study aimed to investigate the association between ACEs and conspiracy endorsement in the general population, specifically questioning a mediating role of epistemic trust and personality functioning. Method(s): Based on cross-sectional data from a representative German survey collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 2501), we conducted structural equation modelling (SEM) where personality functioning (OPD-SQS) and epistemic trust (ETMCQ) were included as mediators of the association between ACEs and conspiracy endorsement. Bootstrapped confidence intervals (5000 samples, 95%-CI) are presented for all paths. Result(s): ACEs were significantly associated with conspiracy endorsement (beta = 0.25, p < 0.001) and explained 6% of its variance. Adding epistemic trust and personality functioning as mediators increased the explained variance of conspiracy endorsement to 19% while the direct association between ACEs and conspiracy endorsement was diminished (beta = 0.12, p < 0.001), indicating an indirect effect of personality functioning and epistemic trust in the association between ACEs and conspiracy endorsement. Fit indices confirmed good model fit. Conclusion(s): Establishing an association between ACEs and conspiracy endorsement further increases the evidence for early childhood adversities' far-reaching and detrimental effects. By including epistemic trust and personality functioning, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the way that ACEs may be associated with conspiracy endorsement.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

Method(s): This descriptive, online cross-sectional study was conducted on medical students of Combined Military Hospital Lahore Medical College & Institute of Dentistry, Lahore Pakistan for 6 months from 1st June to 30th November, 2021. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used as the study tool. Data was analyzed by using statistical software SPSS - 23. Frequencies and percentages were used for descriptive variables. A univariate analysis was utilized to identify the noticeable associations between traits of sample and the anxiety level in current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic. Finally multivariate logistic regression analyses, odds ratio (OR), and Spearman's correlation coefficient, r, was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19-related stressors and anxiety level. Result(s): Of the 324 respondents, majority were females residing in urban areas with their parents. Severe anxiety was experienced by 23.8% of students. Female respondents were found to have more anxiety as compared to males (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.173 - 2.815). Moreover, respondents having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 reported to have more anxiety (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 - 3.804). Conclusion(s): A significant number of students are experiencing anxiety in the post COVID-19 phase, especially those that had an acquaintance infected with COVID-19. There is a need to look after student's mental health and to implement appropriate psychological strategies and interventions to deal with this level of psychological distress in the students at this phase of pandemic for optimum training of future health professionals.Copyright © 2022 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

This work is focused on predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in its early stage in India based on an estimation of R0. The developed model will help policymakers to take active measures prior to the further spread of COVID-19. Data on daily newly infected cases in India from March 2, 2020 to April 2, 2020 were to estimate R0 using the earlyR package. The maximum-likelihood approach was used to analyze the distribution of R0 values, and the bootstrap strategy was applied for resampling to identify the most likely R0 value. We estimated the median value of R0 to be 1.471 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.351 to 1.592) and predicted that the new case count may reach 39,382 (95% CI, 34,300 to 47,351) in 30 days.},

   abstract = {Emissions of black carbon (BC) particles from anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to climate change and human health impacts. Therefore, they need to be accurately quantified to develop an effective mitigation strategy. Although the spread of the emission flux estimates for China have recently narrowed under the constraints of atmospheric observations, consensus has not been reached regarding the dominant emission sector. Here, we quantified the contribution of the residential sector, as 64% (44-82%) in 2019, using the response of the observed atmospheric concentration in the outflowing air during Feb-Mar 2020, with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic and restricted human activities over China. In detail, the BC emission fluxes, estimated after removing effects from meteorological variability, dropped only slightly (- 18%) during Feb-Mar 2020 from the levels in the previous year for selected air masses of Chinese origin, suggesting the contributions from the transport and industry sectors (36%) were smaller than the rest from the residential sector (64%). Carbon monoxide (CO) behaved differently, with larger emission reductions (- 35%) in the period Feb-Mar 2020, suggesting dominance of non-residential (i.e., transport and industry) sectors, which contributed 70% (48-100%) emission during 2019. The estimated BC/CO emission ratio for these sectors will help to further constrain bottom-up emission inventories. We comprehensively provide a clear scientific evidence supporting mitigation policies targeting reduction in residential BC emissions from China by demonstrating the economic feasibility using marginal abatement cost curves.

   abstract = {In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, public fear or social scaring of urban living was observed, which caused people to change their daily routines. This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affected residential choice and perceptions of urban living. We analyzed self-reported survey data collected from 2000 participants in Seoul, Daegu, and Kyeongbuk in South Korea between 3-6 August 2020, targeting the relatively controlled period after the first COVID-19 outbreak. Logistic regression models were used to examine concerns of urban living and residence relocation consideration. Those who were aged 30 or older, regularly commuting, not feeling healthy, with a household size of two, and living in a low-rise condominium were more likely to be concerned with urban living. Those who were aged 40 or older and living in a townhouse or a single-detached house were more likely to consider moving to a less dense area. People perceived that their daily routine changed substantially after the pandemic. Certain participant groups showed concerns of urban living and relocation consideration, suggesting housing policy implications.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Containment measures slowed the spread of COVID-19 but led to a global economic crisis. We establish a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that balances disease control and economic activities. METHOD(S): To train the RL agent, we design an RL environment with 4 semi-connected regions to represent the COVID-19 epidemic in Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa, and Hokkaido, Japan. Every region is governed by a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Removed (SEIQR) model and has a transport hub to connect with other regions. The allocation of the synthetic population and inter-regional traveling is determined by population-weighted density. The agent learns the best policy from interacting with the RL environment, which involves obtaining daily observations, performing actions on individual movement and screening, and receiving feedback from the reward function. After training, we implement the agent into RL environments describing the actual epidemic waves of the four regions to observe the agent's performance. RESULT(S): For all epidemic waves covered by our study, the trained agent reduces the peak number of infectious cases and shortens the epidemics (from 165 to 35 cases and 148 to 131 days for the 5th wave). The agent is generally strict on screening but easy on movement, except for Okinawa, where the agent is easy on both actions. Action timing analyses indicate that restriction on movement is elevated when the number of exposed or infectious cases remains high or infectious cases increase rapidly, and stringency on screening is eased when the number of exposed or infectious cases drops quickly or to a regional low. For Okinawa, action on screening is tightened when the number of exposed or infectious cases increases rapidly. CONCLUSION(S): Our experiments exhibit the potential of the RL in assisting policy-making and how the semi-connected SEIQR models establish an interactive environment for imitating cross-regional human flows.Copyright © 2024.

   abstract = {Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R0 = 2.4 +/- 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rattled global public health, with researchers struggling to find specific therapeutic solutions. In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski's rule of five and Veber's rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them. The present results promise to provide new avenues to further evaluate the potential of the phytocompound taraxerol in vitro and in vivo towards its successful deployment as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor and combat the catastrophic COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

   abstract = {I construct a dynamic social-network model of the COVID-19 epidemic which embeds the SIR epidemiological model onto a graph of person-to-person interactions. The standard SIR framework assumes uniform mixing of infectious persons in the population. This abstracts from important elements of realism and locality: (i) people are more likely to interact with members of their social networks and (ii) health and economic policies can affect differentially the rate of viral transmission via a person's social network vs. the population as a whole. The proposed network-augmented (NSIR) model allows the evaluation, via simulations, of (i) health and economic policies and outcomes for all or subset of the population: lockdown/distancing, herd immunity, testing, contact tracing; (ii) behavioral responses and/ or imposing or lifting policies at specific times or conditional on observed states. I find that viral transmission over a network-connected population can proceed slower and reach lower peak than transmission via uniform mixing. Network connections introduce uncertainty and path dependence in the epidemic dynamics, with a significant role for bridge links and superspreaders. Testing and contact tracing are more effective in the network model. If lifted early, distancing policies mostly shift the infection peak into the future, with associated economic costs. Delayed or intermittent interventions or endogenous behavioral responses generate a multi-peaked infection curve, a form of 'curve flattening', but may have costlier economic consequences by prolonging the epidemic duration.Copyright © 2020 Alexander Karaivanov.

   abstract = {Influenza has a negative sense, single-stranded, and segmented RNA. In the context of pandemic influenza research, most studies have focused on variations in the surface proteins (Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase). However, new findings suggest that all internal and external proteins of influenza viruses can contribute in pandemic emergence, pathogenicity and increasing host range. The occurrence of the 2009 influenza pandemic and the availability of many external and internal segments of pandemic and non-pandemic sequences offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in discrimination of pandemic from seasonal sequences using mutation positions in all segments. In this study, we hypothesized that identifying mutation positions in all segments (proteins) encoded by the influenza genome would enable pandemic and seasonal strains to be more reliably distinguished. In a large scale study, we applied a range of data mining techniques to all segments of influenza for rule discovery and discrimination of pandemic from seasonal strains. CBA (classification based on association rule mining), Ripper and Decision tree algorithms were utilized to extract association rules among mutations. CBA outperformed the other models. Our approach could discriminate pandemic sequences from seasonal ones with more than 95% accuracy for PA and NP, 99.33% accuracy for NA and 100% accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity (recall) for M1, M2, PB1, NS1, and NS2. The values of precision, specificity, and sensitivity were more than 90% for other segments except PB2. If sequences of all segments of one strain were available, the accuracy of discrimination of pandemic strains was 100%. General rules extracted by rule base classification approaches, such as M1-V147I, NP-N334H, NS1-V112I, and PB1-L364I, were able to detect pandemic sequences with high accuracy. We observed that mutations on internal proteins of influenza can contribute in distinguishing the pandemic viruses, similar to the external ones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Model-based forecasts of population size, deaths, and age distribution of people with HIV (PWH) are helpful for public health and clinical services planning but are influenced by subgroup-specific heterogeneities and changes in mortality rates. Method(s): Using an agent-based simulation of PWH in the United States, we examined the impact of distinct approaches to parametrizing mortality rates on forecasted epidemiology of PWH on antiretroviral treatment (ART). We first estimated mortality rates among (1) all PWH, (2) sex-specific, (3) sex-and-race/ethnicity-specific, and (4) sex-race/ethnicity-and-HIV-acquisition-risk-specific subgroups. We then assessed each scenario by (1) allowing unrestricted reductions in age-specific mortality rates over time and (2) restricting the mortality rates among PWH to subgroup-specific mortality thresholds from the general population. Result(s): Among the eight scenarios examined, those lacking subgroup-specific heterogeneities and those allowing unrestricted reductions in future mortality rates forecasted the lowest number of deaths among all PWH and 9 of the 15 subgroups through 2030. The forecasted overall number and age distribution of people with a history of injection drug use were sensitive to inclusion of subgroup-specific mortality rates. Conclusion(s): Our results underscore the potential risk of underestimating future deaths by models lacking subgroup-specific heterogeneities in mortality rates, and those allowing unrestricted reductions in future mortality rates.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

The main goal of this article is, applying the UTAUT 2 (the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), to verify the factors determining the implementation of business intelligence tools in business processes, especially decision-making, and their subsequent optimal use in business practice. The researched scheme was modified according to the specifics of business intelligence tools and was supplemented by user behaviour in decision-making. The verification was performed using a questionnaire survey based on UTAUT 2 theory and 152 respondents were included in the analysis. According to the results, the most important variable of influence on both the behavioural intention and the users' behaviour itself in decision-making was the factor of habit. And surprisingly, some previously recognised links were not confirmed, especially the factors influencing the intention of behaviour (effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions). So, there is room after almost 10 years and experience gained during the Covid-19 pandemic to modify the latest version of a model.

   abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, well known as COVID-19 has become the current health distress to the entire world. In the pandemic scenario the research on the rapid development of new drug molecules is highly risky and tedious process. The current COVID-19 emergency demands an urgent development of possible strategies to protect people at high risk of infection and hence the drug repurposing became an emerging approach to fight COVID-19. This review summarizes an update on various therapeutic strategies with special attention on repurposing of drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes is one line of scientific research followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) that have been believed to be safe through testing on early phase clinical trials have been hyped as good drug repurposing candidates. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin, Umifenovir were advised for COVID-19 treatment. Some antibiotics may be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments such as teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, monensin and azithromycin. Ivermectin an antiparasitic is recently repurposed. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, having immunomodulating effect on humans, have been shown to have antiviral activity at starting and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a need for global health emergency to call for a courageous, global response at the political and governmental levels. Therefore, the regulatory agencies must act swiftly to lessen any financial obstacles involving private companies and update guidelines for drug licenses by repurposing if necessary.Copyright © 2020 iGlobal Research and Publishing Foundation.

   volume = {16},
   number = {8 August},
   pages = {e0256179},
   abstract = {Conspiracy theories in social networks are considered to have adverse effects on individuals' compliance with public health measures in the context of a pandemic situation. A deeper understanding of how conspiracy theories propagate through social networks is critical for the development of countermeasures. The present work focuses on a novel approach to characterize the propagation of conspiracy theories through social networks by applying epidemiological models to Twitter data. A Twitter dataset was searched for tweets containing hashtags indicating belief in the "5GCoronavirus" conspiracy theory, which states that the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of, or enhanced by, the enrollment of the 5G mobile network. Despite the absence of any scientific evidence, the "5GCoronavirus" conspiracy theory propagated rapidly through Twitter, beginning at the end of January, followed by a peak at the beginning of April, and ceasing/disappearing approximately at the end of June 2020. An epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model was fitted to this time series with acceptable model fit, indicating parallels between the propagation of conspiracy theories in social networks and infectious diseases. Extended SIR models were used to simulate the effects that two specific countermeasures, fact-checking and tweet-deletion, could have had on the propagation of the conspiracy theory. Our simulations indicate that fact-checking is an effective mechanism in an early stage of conspiracy theory diffusion, while tweet-deletion shows only moderate efficacy but is less time-sensitive. More generally, an early response is critical to gain control over the spread of conspiracy theories through social networks. We conclude that an early response combined with strong fact-checking and a moderate level of deletion of problematic posts is a promising strategy to fight conspiracy theories in social networks. Results are discussed with respect to their theoretical validity and generalizability.Copyright © 2021 Kauk et al.

Result(s): Between May 2020 and May 2021, over half of respondents in Arizona (57%), 38% in Iowa, and 30% in Wisconsin indicated that they were either unable to access or delayed accessing SRH care or a contraceptive method due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Arizona and Wisconsin, in multivariable models, respondents who had experienced financial instability due to being out of work, having fallen behind on key life payments, or because of a job reduction or loss due to COVID-19 had increased odds of experiencing COVID-19-related SRH care delays (Arizona adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.6, p = 0.01 and Wisconsin aOR = 6.0, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Access to contraception was curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who experienced employment and financial instability. Individuals' and clinics' ability to mitigate these effects were likely dependent on state context and response to the pandemic, among other factors.Copyright © 2022 Megan L. Kavanaugh et al.

   abstract = {COVID-19 evolution imposes significant challenges for the European healthcare system. The heterogeneous spread of the pandemic within EU regions elicited a wide range of policies, such as school closure, transport restrictions, etc. However, the implementation of these interventions is not accompanied by the implementation of quantitative methods, which would indicate their effectiveness. As a result, the efficacy of such policies on reducing the spread of the virus varies significantly. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using deep learning paradigms to accurately model the spread of COVID-19. The deep learning approaches proposed in this paper are able to effectively map the temporal evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak, while simultaneously taking into account policy interventions directly into the modelling process. Thus, our approach facilitates data-driven decision making by utilizing previous knowledge to train models that predict not only the spread of COVID-19, but also the effect of specific policy measures on minimizing this spread. Global models at the EU level are proposed, which can be successfully applied at the national level. These models use various inputs in order to successfully model the spatio-temporal variability of the phenomenon and obtain generalization abilities. The proposed models are compared against the traditional epidemiological and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intervention measures have been implemented around the world to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the dynamics of the disease spread and the effectiveness of the interventions is essential in predicting its future evolution., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of different social distancing interventions and investigate whether their timing and stringency can lead to multiple waves (subepidemics), which can provide a better fit to the wavy behavior observed in the infected population curve in the majority of countries., METHODS: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance., RESULTS: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes. We also provided an estimate of how much lower the number of infections could have been if early and strict intervention measures had been taken to stop the spread at the first wave, as actually happened for a handful of countries. A novel index, the Pandemic Response Index, was constructed, and based on the model's results, an index value was assigned to each country, quantifying in an objective manner the country's response to the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic can be successfully modeled as a series of epidemic waves (subepidemics) and that it is possible to infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures can slow the spread of the disease.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for policy makers to receive timely and ongoing scientific guidance in response to this recently emerged human infectious disease. Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provide a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the effective reproduction number, (Formula presented.), has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control ((Formula presented.)). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks. Here, focusing on the dynamics of the first wave (March-June 2020), we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the time course of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.},

   journal = {Epidemics},
   volume = {37},
   pages = {100526},
   abstract = {COVID-19 in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days. The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed. From August 2020, infections, hospitalisations and deaths began rising once more and various NPIs were applied locally throughout the UK in response. Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Typically, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These "precautionary breaks" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their societal impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the UK SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths caused by COVID-19 disease. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures to regain control.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Efforts to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have seen non-pharmaceutical interventions being invoked. The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a "stay at home" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.Copyright © 2021 Keeling et al.

   abstract = {By mid-May 2020, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1 June 2020. Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

   abstract = {Sexual health communication warrants greater attention as it may help to reduce the rates of HIV incidence among youth. A growing body of literature suggests that conversations about sexual health among Black and Latino youth may serve as a potential strategy for HIV prevention. The current study investigates whether sexual health communication-in particular, conversations about sexual health and HIV-influences Black and Latino youth's personal agency regarding their role in achieving an HIV-free generation. For this secondary data analysis, we used the National Survey of Teens and Young Adults on attitudes towards HIV/AIDS (n = 701). Participants included youth between the ages 15 and 24, and the average was 20 years. We used a multiple regression analysis to examine whether sexual health communication contributed to youth knowledge and awareness of (1) the national plan for EHE, and (2) their role in ending the epidemic". (1) knowledge and awareness of the national plan for EHE, and (2) role in ending the epidemic. The final multiple regression model was statistically significant [R2 = 0.16 F (12, 701) = 001, p < 0.001] for both outcomes. Study results found that sexual health communication was positively related to Black and Latino youth's awareness of efforts to end the HIV epidemic (EHE) and their belief that they could play a role in achieving EHE. In addition, HIV stigma influenced personal agency and whether youth were aware of efforts to achieve EHE. Our results demonstrated that openly communicating about sexual health and HIV may contribute to a sense of personal agency among Black and Latino youth. In addition, understanding whether sexual health communication contributes to a sense of personal agency among youth may inform HIV prevention efforts to achieve the goals set forth by the national EHE plan for the U.S.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   volume = {32},

   pages = {720-726},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses show a strong seasonal spreading in temperate regions. Several studies indicated that changes in indoor humidity could be one of the key factors explaining this. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study is to quantify the association between relevant epidemiological metrics and humidity in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic periods. METHOD(S): The atmospheric dew point temperature serves as a proxy for indoor relative humidity. This study considered the weekly mortality rate in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2019 to determine the correlation between the dew point and the spread of influenza. During influenza epidemic periods in the Netherlands, governmental restrictions were absent; therefore, there is no need to control this confounder. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governmental restrictions strongly varied over time. To control this effect, periods with a relatively constant governmental intervention level were selected to analyze the reproduction rate. We also examine SARS-CoV-2 deaths in the nursing home setting, where health policy and social factors were less variable. Viral transmissibility was measured by computing the ratio between the estimated daily number of infectious persons in the Netherlands and the lagged mortality figures in the nursing homes. RESULT(S): For both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, a significant correlation was found between the dew point temperature and the aforementioned epidemiological metrics. The findings are consistent with the anticipated mechanisms related to droplet evaporation, stability of virus in the indoor environment, and impairment of the natural defenses of the respiratory tract in dry air. SIGNIFICANCE: This information is helpful to understand the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses and motivate further study to what extent it is possible to alter the seasonal pattern by actively intervening in the adverse role of low humidity during fall and winter in temperate regions. IMPACT: A solid understanding and quantification of the role of humidity on the transmission of respiratory viruses is imperative for epidemiological modeling and the installation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The results of this study indicate that improving the indoor humidity by humidifiers could be a promising technology for reducing the spread of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 during winter and fall in the temperate zone. The identification of this potential should be seen as a strong motivation to invest in further prospective testing of this non-pharmaceutical intervention.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, mental health professionals have been called upon to cope with various challenges, including the shift to telehealth without prior training, overload in the workplace, increased risk of infection, and personal stressors relating to the pandemic. This article presents the qualitative findings of a larger international mixed-method study that explored the experiences of creative arts therapists around the globe during the first year of the pandemic (Feniger-Schaal et al., 2022). Twenty creative arts therapists were interviewed between July 2020 and March 2021. Transcriptions of the interviews were qualitatively analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Three main themes were identified: an experience of processing the losses caused by the pandemic, a restorative orientation that focused on adaptations the therapists made, and innovations that lead to personal and professional growth. Artistic engagement and creativity were found to be a resource when coping with losses and helped therapists adapt to the shift to tele-creative arts therapies (tele-CAT). Although this shift can lead to advances in the field of creative arts therapies, it requires further consideration, including the need for ethical guidelines, specific training, the development of digital methods that support the creative process, and dedicated supervision for therapists. The findings also point to the importance of psychological support to mitigate the burden therapists experience during stressful events.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   title = {COVID-19, trade collapse and GVC linkages: European experience},
   journal = {The World economy},
   abstract = {This paper highlights the role of supply chain linkages for the transmission of COVID-19-induced shocks based on the monthly trade of the European Union Member States during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the framework of the gravity model, we find an overall decline of over 20% in trade among EU countries following the COVID-19 outbreak. Both supply and demand shocks are shown to contribute to this trade decline associated with COVID-19 in the origin and destination country proxied by either infection rate or policy stringency index. While import demand shocks have an immediate effect on trade decline, the trade becomes increasingly sensitive to the COVID-19 situation in the origin country over time. Moreover, the results confirm that forward global value chain (GVC) linkages act as a channel for the transmission of (demand) shocks in supply chain trade. Indeed, an increase in the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the destination country leads to a larger decrease in domestic exports of intermediate goods in those destination countries with which a country has stronger forward linkages, that is in partners positioned further downstream. We also find the 'China effect', with the transmission of the COVID-19 shock from the partner country amplified when the share of supply chain trade with China is higher. On the other hand, we fail to find robust evidence for the transmission of COVID-19-induced shocks via backward linkages. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 has been greatly impacted by regulatory policies and behavior patterns that vary across counties, states, and countries. Population-level dynamics of COVID-19 can generally be described using a set of ordinary differential equations, but these deterministic equations are insufficient for modeling the observed case rates, which can vary due to local testing and case reporting policies and nonhomogeneous behavior among individuals. To assess the impact of population mobility on the spread of COVID-19, we have developed a novel Bayesian time-varying coefficient state-space model for infectious disease transmission. The foundation of this model is a time-varying coefficient compartment model to recapitulate the dynamics among susceptible, exposed, undetected infectious, detected infectious, undetected removed, hospitalized, detected recovered, and detected deceased individuals. The infectiousness and detection parameters are modeled to vary by time, and the infectiousness component in the model incorporates information on multiple sources of population mobility. Along with this compartment model, a multiplicative process model is introduced to allow for deviation from the deterministic dynamics. We apply this model to observed COVID-19 cases and deaths in several U.S. states and Colorado counties. We find that population mobility measures are highly correlated with transmission rates and can explain complicated temporal variation in infectiousness in these regions. Additionally, the inferred connections between mobility and epidemiological parameters, varying across locations, have revealed the heterogeneous effects of different policies on the dynamics of COVID-19.

Moreover, these approaches may also be used in evaluating the performance of public health surveillance systems. We provide theoretical arguments for why the empirical laws should hold in the early stages of an epidemic, along with preliminary empirical evidence in support of these claims. Based on data published by the World Health Organization and various national governments, we find empirical evidence that suggests that both Benford's law and Zipf's law largely hold across countries, and deviations can be readily explained. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to present a practical application of Zipf's law to fraud detection.},

   abstract = {We estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the United Kingdom economy, including direct disease effects, preventive public actions and associated policies. A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of 39.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is 308bn (13.5% of GDP); 66bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and 201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to 668bn (29.2% of GDP), where 166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: After a COVID-19 diagnosis, vulnerable populations face considerable logistical and financial challenges to isolate and quarantine. We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach ('Test-to-Care' Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households., METHODS: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team, which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs., RESULTS: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time-this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement., CONCLUSIONS: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations.},

   abstract = {The Gateway Belief Model (GBM) places perception of a scientific consensus as a key "gateway cognition" with cascading effects on personal beliefs, concern, and ultimately support for public policies. However, few studies seeking to evaluate and extend the model have followed the specification and design of the GBM as originally outlined. We present a more complete test of the theoretical model in a novel domain: the COVID-19 pandemic. In a large multi-country correlational study (N = 7,206) we report that, as hypothesized by the model, perceptions of scientific consensus regarding the threat of COVID-19 predict personal attitudes toward threat and worry over the virus, which are in turn positively associated with support for mitigation policies. We also find causal support for the model in a large pre-registered survey experiment (N = 1,856): experimentally induced increases in perceived consensus have an indirect effect on changes in policy support mediated via changes in personal agreement with the consensus. Implications for the role of expert consensus in science communication are discussed. Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

   abstract = {Disease modelling has had considerable policy impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it is increasingly acknowledged that combining multiple models can improve the reliability of outputs. Here we report insights from ten weeks of collaborative short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland (12 October-19 December 2020). The study period covers the onset of the second wave in both countries, with tightening non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequently a decay (Poland) or plateau and renewed increase (Germany) in reported cases. Thirteen independent teams provided probabilistic real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These were reported for lead times of one to four weeks, with evaluation focused on one- and two-week horizons, which are less affected by changing NPIs. Heterogeneity between forecasts was considerable both in terms of point predictions and forecast spread. Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance, in particular in terms of coverage, but did not clearly dominate single-model predictions. The study was preregistered and will be followed up in future phases of the pandemic.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The epidemic situation may cause severe social and economic impacts on a country. So, there is a need for a trustworthy prediction model that can offer better prediction results. The forecasting result will help in making the prevention policies and remedial action in time, and thus, we can reduce the overall social and economic impacts on the country. This article introduces a CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning prediction model, which can correctly forecast the COVID-19 epidemic across India. The proposed model uses convolutional layers, to extract meaningful information and learn from a given time series dataset. It is also enriched with the LSTM layer's capability, which means it can identify long-term and short-term dependencies. The experimental evaluation has been performed to gauge the performance and suitability of our proposed model among the other well-established time series forecasting models. From the empirical analysis, it is also clear that the use of extra convolutional layers with the LSTM layer may increase the forecasting model's performance. Apart from this, the deep insides of the current situation of medical resource availability across India have been discussed.

   abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 has induced a worldwide pandemic and subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the spread of the virus. As in many countries, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany has led to a consecutive roll-out of different NPIs. As these NPIs have (largely unknown) adverse effects, targeting them precisely and monitoring their effectiveness are essential. We developed a compartmental infection dynamics model with specific features of SARS-CoV-2 that allows daily estimation of a time-varying reproduction number and published this information openly since the beginning of April 2020. Here, we present the transmission dynamics in Germany over time to understand the effect of NPIs and allow adaptive forecasts of the epidemic progression. Method(s): We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states using our model. Using parameter estimates from literature and, alternatively, with parameters derived from a fit to the initial phase of COVID-19 spread in different regions of Italy, the model was optimized to fit data from the Robert Koch Institute. Result(s): The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) in Germany decreased to <1 in early April 2020, 2-3 weeks after the implementation of NPIs. Partial release of NPIs both nationally and on federal state level correlated with moderate increases in Rt until August 2020. Implications of state-specific Rt on other states and on national level are characterized. Retrospective evaluation of the model shows excellent agreement with the data and usage of inpatient facilities well within the healthcare limit. While short-term predictions may work for a few weeks, long-term projections are complicated by unpredictable structural changes. Conclusion(s): The estimated fraction of immunized population by August 2020 warns of a renewed outbreak upon release of measures. A low detection rate prolongs the delay reaching a low case incidence number upon release, showing the importance of an effective testing-quarantine strategy. We show that real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics is important to evaluate the extent of the outbreak, short-term projections for the burden on the healthcare system, and their response to policy changes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic spread rapidly throughout India, with 34,587,822 confirmed cases and 468,980 deaths as of November 30, 2021. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have implemented to mitigate the outbreak and prevent the persistence of the COVID-19 in human-to-human transmission in India and worldwide. Hence, the mathematical study of the disease transmission becomes essential to illuminate the real nature of the transmission behavior and control of the diseases. We proposed a compartmental model that stratify into nine stages of infection. The incidence data of the SRAS-CoV-2 outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve and we estimated the parameters from the best fitted curve. Based on the estimated model parameters, we performed a short-term prediction of our model. We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to R0 and obtained that the disease transmission rate has an impact in reducing the spread of diseases. Furthermore, considering the non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention policies as control functions, an optimal control problem is implemented to reduce the disease fatality. To mitigate the infected individuals and to minimize the cost of the controls, an objective functional has been formulated and solved with the aid of Pontryagin's maximum principle. This study suggest that the implementation of optimal control strategy at the start of a pandemic tends to decrease the intensity of epidemic peaks, spreading the maximal impact of an epidemic over an extended time period. Our numerical simulations exhibit that the combination of two controls is more effective when compared with the combination of single control as well as no control.

   abstract = {Background and objective: As a response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several prediction models in the existing literature were rapidly developed, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidance. However, none of these COVID-19 prediction models have been found to be reliable. Models are commonly assessed to have a risk of bias, often due to insufficient reporting, use of non-representative data, and lack of large-scale external validation. In this paper, we present the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modeling as a standardized approach for rapid yet reliable development and validation of prediction models. We demonstrate how our analytics pipeline and open-source software tools can be used to answer important prediction questions while limiting potential causes of bias (e.g., by validating phenotypes, specifying the target population, performing large-scale external validation, and publicly providing all analytical source code). Method(s): We show step-by-step how to implement the analytics pipeline for the question: 'In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, what is the risk of death 0 to 30 days after hospitalization?'. We develop models using six different machine learning methods in a USA claims database containing over 20,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and externally validate the models using data containing over 45,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations from South Korea, Spain, and the USA. Result(s): Our open-source software tools enabled us to efficiently go end-to-end from problem design to reliable Model Development and evaluation. When predicting death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, AdaBoost, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree yielded similar or lower internal and external validation discrimination performance compared to L1-regularized logistic regression, whereas the MLP neural network consistently resulted in lower discrimination. L1-regularized logistic regression models were well calibrated. Conclusion(s): Our results show that following the OHDSI analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modelling can enable the rapid development towards reliable prediction models. The OHDSI software tools and pipeline are open source and available to researchers from all around the world.Copyright © 2021},

Method(s): 148 national HIV estimates files were used to project the HIV epidemic to 2050. Numbers of people living with HIV and new HIV infections were projected by sex and five-year age group. Along with demographic data, projections were based on three key assumptions: future trends in HIV incidence, antiretroviral treatment coverage, and coverage of antiretrovirals for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Results represent nine geographic regions. Result(s): While the number of adolescents and young people is projected to increase by 10% from 2010-2050, those living with HIV is projected to decrease by 61%. In Eastern and Southern Africa, which hosts the largest HIV epidemic, new HIV infections among adolescents and young people are projected to decline by 84% from 2010-2050. In West and Central Africa, which hosts the second-largest HIV epidemic, new infections are projected to decline by 35%. Conclusion(s): While adolescents and young people living with HIV are living longer and ageing into adulthood, if current trends continue, the number of new HIV infections is not projected to decline fast enough to end AIDS as a health threat in this age group. Regional variations suggest that while progress in Eastern and Southern Africa could reduce the size of the epidemic by 2050, other regions exhibit slower rates of decline among adolescents and young people.},

   abstract = {The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 has imposed clinical and financial burdens on hospitals and governments attempting to provide patients with medical care and implement disease-controlling policies. The transmissibility of the disease was shown to be correlated with the patient's viral load, which can be measured during testing using the cycle threshold (Ct). Previous models have utilized Ct to forecast the trajectory of the spread, which can provide valuable information to better allocate resources and change policies. However, these models combined other variables specific to medical institutions or came in the form of compartmental models that rely on epidemiological assumptions, all of which could impose prediction uncertainties. In this study, we overcome these limitations using data-driven modeling that utilizes Ct and previous number of cases, two institution-independent variables. We collected three groups of patients (n = 6296, n = 3228, and n = 12,096) from different time periods to train, validate, and independently validate the models. We used three machine learning algorithms and three deep learning algorithms that can model the temporal dynamic behavior of the number of cases. The endpoint was 7-week forward number of cases, and the prediction was evaluated using mean square error (MSE). The sequence-to-sequence model showed the best prediction during validation (MSE = 0.025), while polynomial regression (OLS) and support vector machine regression (SVR) had better performance during independent validation (MSE = 0.1596, and MSE = 0.16754, respectively), which exhibited better generalizability of the latter. The OLS and SVR models were used on a dataset from an external institution and showed promise in predicting COVID-19 incidences across institutions. These models may support clinical and logistic decision-making after prospective validation.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {The ongoing global pandemic has sharply increased the amount of data available to researchers in epidemiology and public health. Unfortunately, few existing analysis tools are capable of exploiting all of the information contained in a pandemic-scale data set, resulting in missed opportunities for improved surveillance and contact tracing. In this paper, we develop the variational Bayesian skyline (VBSKY), a method for fitting Bayesian phylodynamic models to very large pathogen genetic data sets. By combining recent advances in phylodynamic modeling, scalable Bayesian inference and differentiable programming, along with a few tailored heuristics, VBSKY is capable of analyzing thousands of genomes in a few minutes, providing accurate estimates of epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the effective reproduction number and overall sampling effort through time. We illustrate the utility of our method by performing a rapid analysis of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and demonstrate that the resulting estimates closely track those derived from alternative sources of public health data.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the impact of the COVID-19 stay-at-home order on gun violence in Buffalo, New York: fatal shootings, all non-fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings with injury, and non-fatal shootings without injury. It also estimated its impact on gang and non-gang related shootings., METHODS: Weekly crime data are analyzed at the city level using ARIMA and poisson models. Forecasting is used to verify the validity of both ARIMA and poisson models., RESULTS: The effect of the pandemic was conditional upon the types of gun violence and impact models of intervention. The pandemic caused a temporary increase in fatal shootings while leading to a long-term increase in all non-fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings with injury, non-fatal shootings without injury, and gang related shootings., CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed the volume of gun violence possibly due to increased strain and/or changed routine activities. This study not only promotes further research but also has policy implications for public health and safety. From a public policy perspective, criminal justice agencies should focus more attention and resources on gun violence resulting from a sense of strain and fear among individuals during the pandemic.

   abstract = {Responses to COVID-19 altered environmental exposures and health behaviours associated with non-communicable diseases. We aimed to (1) quantify changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), noise, physical activity, and greenspace visits associated with COVID-19 policies in the spring of 2020 in Barcelona (Spain), Vienna (Austria), and Stockholm (Sweden), and (2) estimated the number of additional and prevented diagnoses of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, depression, and anxiety based on these changes. We calculated differences in NO2, noise, physical activity, and greenspace visits between pre-pandemic (baseline) and pandemic (counterfactual) levels. With two counterfactual scenarios, we distinguished between Acute Period (March 15th - April 26th, 2020) and Deconfinement Period (May 2nd - June 30th, 2020) assuming counterfactual scenarios were extended for 12 months. Relative risks for each exposure difference were estimated with exposure-risk functions. In the Acute Period, reductions in NO2 (range of change from -16.9 mug/m3 to -1.1 mug/m3), noise (from -5 dB(A) to -2 dB(A)), physical activity (from -659 MET*min/wk to -183 MET*min/wk) and greenspace visits (from -20.2 h/m to 1.1 h/m) were largest in Barcelona and smallest in Stockholm. In the Deconfinement Period, NO2 (from -13.9 mug/m3 to -3.1 mug/m3), noise (from -3 dB(A) to -1 dB(A)), and physical activity levels (from -524 MET*min/wk to -83 MET*min/wk) remained below pre-pandemic levels in all cities. Greatest impacts were caused by physical activity reductions. If physical activity levels in Barcelona remained at Acute Period levels, increases in annual diagnoses for MI (mean: 572 (95% CI: 224, 943)), stroke (585 (6, 1156)), depression (7903 (5202, 10,936)), and anxiety (16,677 (926, 27,002)) would be anticipated. To decrease cardiovascular and mental health impacts, reductions in NO2 and noise from the first COVID-19 surge should be sustained, but without reducing physical activity. Focusing on cities' connectivity that promotes active transportation and reduces motor vehicle use assists in achieving this goal.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   journal = {American Journal of Emergency Medicine},
   volume = {60},
   pages = {9-14},
   abstract = {Introduction: Some guidelines had recommended "thrombolysis first" in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The impact of COVID-19 solely on STEMI thrombolysis is lacking as most studies reported outcomes related to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) setting. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STEMI thrombolysis outcomes and the Emergency Department's performance in a non-PCI capable centre. Method(s): This single-centre retrospective study analysed data on consecutive STEMI patients who received thrombolytic therapy from May 2019 to December 2020 (20 months) in a non-PCI capable tertiary hospital. Total population sampling was used in this study. We compared all patients' characteristics and outcomes ten months before and during the pandemic. Regression models were used to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on door-to-needle time (DNT), mortality, bleeding events, and the number of overnight stays. Results and discussion: We analysed 323 patients with a mean age of 52.9 +/- 12.9 years and were predominantly male (n = 280, 88.9%). There was a 12.5% reduction in thrombolysis performed during the pandemic. No significant difference in timing from symptoms onset to thrombolysis and DNT was observed. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.02-4.00, p = 0.044). Bleeding events post thrombolysis remained stable and there was no significant difference in the number of overnight stays during the pandemic. Conclusion(s): STEMI thrombolysis cases were reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an inverse increase in mortality despite the preserved Emergency Department performance in timely thrombolysis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

   title = {Household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal health behaviors in the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak},
   journal = {Women's Health},
   volume = {17},
   abstract = {Objectives: Household chaos, including disorder, noise, and crowding within the home, is a risk factor for poor mental and physical health. Household chaos may act upon maternal behaviors of physical activity and sleep, potentially via higher stress. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal physical activity and sleep, and identify barriers to home organization during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A cross-sectional study using an online survey of 1721 mothers of preschoolers (ages = 3.0-5.9 years) in the United States was conducted in May 2020 during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, stress, physical activity and sleep, and barriers to home organization during the outbreak. Mediation models were conducted among household chaos, stress, and physical activity and sleep with adjustment for covariates. Result(s): About half of mothers were middle income (48.2%), employed full-time prior to the outbreak (59.1%), and met the physical activity (47.7%), and sleep guideline (49.7%, 7-9 h/day). Household chaos and stress were both negatively related to physical activity and sleep. For every 1 unit increase in mother's current stress, mothers were 11% (95% confidence interval = 6% to 16%) less likely to meet the physical activity guideline and 19% (95% confidence interval = 14% to 23%) less likely to meet the sleep guideline. Household chaos was positively related to stress. Stress partially mediated the relationship between household chaos and physical activity and sleep. Virus concerns, occupational changes (i.e. teleworking), and lack of childcare were barriers to home organization. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 outbreak, many mothers had poor sleep and physical activity, which was associated with household chaos and stress. Opportunities to promote order at the individual, household, and community level may result in beneficial mental and physical health in mothers of young children during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.},

   abstract = {Background: Individuals with low income experience worse HIV treatment outcomes. Although such disparities may be due to financial barriers in accessing HIV care, stigma related to poverty may be another mechanism linking socioeconomic disadvantage to poor HIV-related health outcomes. We examined whether experienced poverty stigma was associated with worseHIV care and treatment outcomes and whether depression mediates these relationships. Method(s): We analyzed cross-sectional data from 436 women living with HIV enrolled in the Women's Adherence and Visit Engagement (WAVE) sub-study of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), conducted in San Francisco, CA, Atlanta, GA, Birmingham, AL and Jackson, MS. The exposure was experienced poverty stigma, measured using 4 items from the Perceived Stigma of Poverty Scale. Outcomes were viral suppression, CD4 >= 350 cells/mm3, self-reported >= 95% adherence, and no missed HIV care visits in the past 6 months. The mediator was depression, measured by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for income, age, race/ethnicity, education, non-prescribed drug use, and months taking ART. We tested whether the association of poverty stigma with the outcomes was mediated by depression scores, using indirect effects analysis with bootstrapping. Result(s): Each unit increase in mean experienced poverty stigma score was associated with lower adjusted odds (aOR) of viral suppression (aOR:0.79, 95% CI:0.64, 0.98), having a CD4 count >= 350 cells/mm3 (aOR:0.69, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.89), >= 95% ART adherence (aOR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.93), and no missed HIV care visits (aOR:0.71, 95% CI:0.53, 0.95). Depression significantly mediated the negative relationship between experienced poverty stigma and having a CD4 count >= 350 cells/mm3 (indirect effect:-0.09, 95% CI:-0.16,-0.04; direct effect:-0.27, 95% CI:-0.31, 0.05), as well as experienced poverty stigma and >= 95% ART adherence (indirect effect:-0.11, 95% CI:-0.18,-0.04; direct effect:-0.17, 95% CI:-0.26, 0.04). Conclusion(s): Experienced poverty stigma was associated with worse HIV health outcomes, even after adjusting for income, and depression was a significant pathway for some of these relationships. Longitudinal research should assess these relationships over time. Findings support interventions and policies that seek to both reduce poverty stigma and address depression among people living with HIV.},

   volume = {58},
   number = {6},
   abstract = {Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a major threat to nurses' health. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting nurses' health promotion behaviors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): The participants were clinical nurses who had direct contact with patients at a university hospital in G province, Korea. Data were collected from March 16 to April 16, 2021, and the final analysis included data from 162 nurses. The general and lifestyle characteristics of the participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the effect on health promotion behavior was analyzed using multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 21.0. Result(s): The results showed that the factors influencing nurses' health promotion behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic were social support (beta = 0.40, p < 0.001), self-efficacy (beta = 0.27, p = 0.014), being married (beta = 0.18, p = 0.018), having good health (beta = 0.31, p < 0.001), and not skipping meals (beta = 0.20, p = 0.001). The explanatory power of the variables was 51.4%. Therefore, health promotion programs to promote social support and self-efficacy are needed to improve nurses' health promotion behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the development of additional management strategies for health promotion among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic is necessary. It is necessary to prepare organizational policies and manage self-care to improve nurses' irregular eating habits during the ongoing pandemic.},

   abstract = {Background: Individuals are at an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the impact on mental health outcomes that were induced by national-level policies, which may influence an individual at the community level, exploring the comprehensive relations between individual and environmental factors are needed. The aim is to examine socio-ecological factors associated with mental health outcomes, including depressive and anxiety symptoms, with the perspective of support to provide interventions that help the community during future disease outbreaks., Method: From 5 November to 20 November 2020, a cross-sectional and population-based study was conducted to assess the socio-ecological factors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,000 participants, aged 20-69 years, in Chungnam Region, South Korea, were included in this study. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the association between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. The primary outcomes were individuals' mental health outcomes which are measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores., Results: Of the 1,000 participants, the average PHQ-9 was 4.39, and GAD-7 was 3.21 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the participants with moderate or severe levels of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were 12.6 and 6.8%, respectively. Higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with participants who were single, reported a lower household income, had decreased support from friends or family, and increased stress from the workplace or home. In subgroup analyses by age, gender, and household income, a similar trend was reported in individual and interpersonal-level factors. There were significant associations between regional-level factors, including gross regional domestic product (GRDP), mental health institutions, psychiatrists, nurse-to-population ratios, and individuals' mental health outcomes., Conclusion: The management of depressive and anxiety symptoms of individuals during the pandemic was better explained by individual and interpersonal characteristics rather than regional-level factors, highlighting the need for more policies aimed at these lower levels.

   abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, loneliness has increased in the general population due to government measures to contain the spread of the disease. In Latin America (LA), caregiving is most often delivered informally by family members Family caregivers often face mental health challenges linked to their caregiving role and their social context. Pandemic-related social restrictions have been especially detrimental for older people with dementia or other brain health challenges, as well as their family caregivers. We aimed to investigate the associations of loneliness, social isolation and care burden in these family caregivers. Method(s): We undertook a cross-sectional survey of over 300 informal caregivers of people with dementia or enduring mental health problems living in 4 Latin American countries, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. We categorized loneliness into 3 groups 'low', 'moderate' and 'severe loneliness'. Here, we analyzed factors related to changes in the prevalence of moderate and severe loneliness before and during the pandemic using a longitudinal multinomial logistic regression model. Result(s): During the pandemic, there was a significant increase in loneliness prevalence (p<.001) among caregivers in Latin America, with more people having moderate (6.25% pre-pandemic; 17.67% mid-pandemic) and severe loneliness (2.78% pre-pandemic; 15.19% mid-pandemic). Gender differences in the prevalence of loneliness or higher levels of loneliness among dementia caregivers compared to caregivers of other conditions were not seen. The regression model revealed that the increment in risk for moderate loneliness during the pandemic was related to caregivers' age, level of education, and social contact/isolation. Increased risk for severe loneliness was related to caregivers' social contact during the pandemic and perceived mental health. Conclusion(s): Public health interventions regarding COVID-19 pandemic should consider increased loneliness in Latin-American caregivers. This population will need both, short and long-term mental health and practical support. Next steps include gathering more evidence on specific risk factors for loneliness and its impact on caregivers' physical and mental health.Copyright © 2022 the Alzheimer's Association.},

   abstract = {Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for managing to contain, mitigate, and limit of the COVID-19. However, it is more essential to highlight the urgency and importance of evaluating social functioning and mental health status during the pandemic. College students have experienced serious problems and have had to overcome many negative situations brought about by the pandemic. Accordingly, the present study intended to use Chinese college students as sample to examine the positive adoption and changes during the ongoing COVID-19. Guided by literatures in this filed, we explored the internal mechanism of post-traumatic growth affecting psychological resilience, and considered about mediation roles of positive coping styles and cognitive reappraisal. A total of 463 college students from universities in China effectively completed online questionnaires. The result indicated that these four variables were positively correlated with each other (ps < 0.001). More importantly, our findings proved a direct and positive effect on psychological resilience. Positive coping styles and cognitive reappraisal, respectively, mediated the relationship between post-traumatic growth and psychological resilience. Over all, the hypothesized serial model conclusively fits the data: students with high-level post-traumatic growth tended to report increased use of positive coping strategies, which further facilitated their cognitive reappraisal, and subsequently, promoted their psychological resilience. The findings obtained in this study will provide a theoretical basis and possible viable strategies for both targeted crisis intervention and psychological trauma recovery plans.Copyright © 2022 Li and Hu.},

   abstract = {Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco County (SFC) had to shift many nonemergency health care resources to COVID-19, reducing HIV control resources. We sought to quantify COVID-19 effects on HIV burden among men who have sex with men (MSM) as SFC returns to pre-COVID service levels and progresses toward the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) goals. Setting(s): Microsimulation model of MSM in SFC tracking HIV progression and treatment. Method(s): Scenario analysis where services affected by COVID-19 [testing, care engagement, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake, and retention] return to pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 or 2025, compared against a counterfactual where COVID-19 changes never occurred. We also examined scenarios where resources are prioritized to reach new patients or retain of existing patients from 2023 to 2025 before all services return to pre-COVID levels. Result(s): The annual number of MSM prescribed PrEP, newly acquired HIV, newly diagnosed, and achieving viral load suppression (VLS) rebound quickly after HIV care returns to pre-COVID levels. However, COVID-19 service disruptions result in measurable reductions in cumulative PrEP use, VLS person-years, incidence, and an increase in deaths over the 2020-2035 period. The burden is statistically significantly larger if these effects end in 2025 instead of 2022. Prioritizing HIV care/prevention initiation over retention results in more person-years of PrEP but less VLS person-years and more deaths, influencing EHE PrEP outcomes. Conclusion(s): Earlier HIV care return to pre-COVID levels results in lower cumulative HIV burdens. Resource prioritization decisions may differentially affect different EHE goals.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {A question central to the Covid-19 pandemic is why the Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in Covid-19 mortality. Covid-19 mortality rate was calculated as number of deaths per 100 Covid-19 cases. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries. We retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases. Covid-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with Covid-19 test number per 100 people (RR = 0.92, P = 0.001), government effectiveness score (RR = 0.96, P = 0.017), and number of hospital beds (RR = 0.85, P < 0.001). Covid-19 mortality rate was positively associated with proportion of population aged 65 or older (RR = 1.12, P < 0.001) and transport infrastructure quality score (RR = 1.08, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the negative association between Covid-19 mortality and test number was stronger among low-income countries and countries with lower government effectiveness scores, younger populations and fewer hospital beds. Predicted mortality rates were highly associated with observed mortality rates (r = 0.77; P < 0.001). Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the interrelations between joy at work, vocational identity, and COVID-19-related latent variables. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was adopted to survey 253 registered nurses through nursing organizations and social networking sites during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Structural Equation Modeling through Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) was employed to accurately analyze and estimate relationships among joy at work, vocational identity, and COVID-19-related constructs in compliance with published standards and guidelines. RESULT(S): Thirty-one items received convergent validity measures to represent the five study constructs related to joy at work, vocational identity, and Work life Impact of COVID-19 pandemic: Meaning, Engagement, and Growth (MEG), Compassion, Sensitivity, and Respect (CSR), Trust, Support, and Flexibility (TSF), Vocational Identity Questionnaire (VIQ), and Work life Impact of COVID-19 pandemic (CI). The generated model exhibited good model fit and consistent quality indices. The data fit statistically with the model: (Average Path Coefficient = 0.195, p<0.000); Average R-Squared = 0.156, p<0.003; Average Adjusted R-Squared = 0.151, p<0.004; Average Variance Inflation Factor = 2.193 (within the ideal range); Average Full collinearity VIF = 2.388 (within the ideal range), and Tenenhaus Goodness of Fit (GoF) = 0.329. The perceived Work life Impact of COVID-19 pandemic (CI) was a significant predictor of joy at work constructs (MEG, CSR, and TSF) and VIQ with direct effects. It also exerted a negative influence over MEG and TSF, but positively on CSR and VIQ. Notably, joy at work constructs significantly mediated the effects of CI on VIQ. CONCLUSION(S): A structural model was developed that offers insights and a parsimonious explanation for the interrelations of COVID-19, joy at work, and vocational identity variables. The pandemic unquestionably influences the nurses' perceived joy, sense of calling, and meaning in life's work, and joy at work enhances nurses' work-life worth during challenging times. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An increased understanding of nurses' joy at work during challenging times can potentially influence work culture, informs individual nurses, nurse leaders, and healthcare systems in all professional domains of practice and provides the foundational information to identify barriers to joy and strategies that enhance joy.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {In December 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The epidemic quickly broke out and spread throughout the country. Now it becomes a pandemic that affects the whole world. In this study, three models were used to fit and predict the epidemic situation in China: a modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) dynamic model, a neural network method LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and a GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model reflecting spatial heterogeneity. Overall, all the three models performed well with great accuracy. The dynamic SEIRD prediction APE (absolute percent error) of China had been * 1.0% since Mid-February. The LSTM model showed comparable accuracy. The GWR model took into account the influence of geographical differences, with R2 = 99.98% in fitting and 97.95% in prediction. Wilcoxon test showed that none of the three models outperformed the other two at the significance level of 0.05. The parametric analysis of the infectious rate and recovery rate demonstrated that China's national policies had effectively slowed down the spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the models in this study provided a wide range of implications for other countries to predict the short-term and long-term trend of COVID-19, and to evaluate the intensity and effect of their interventions.Copyright: © 2020 Liu et al.

   abstract = {Deep neural networks have been integrated into the whole clinical decision procedure which can improve the efficiency of diagnosis and alleviate the heavy workload of physicians. Since most neural networks are supervised, their performance heavily depends on the volume and quality of available labels. However, few such labels exist for rare diseases (e.g., new pandemics). Here we report a medical multimodal large language model (Med-MLLM) for radiograph representation learning, which can learn broad medical knowledge (e.g., image understanding, text semantics, and clinical phenotypes) from unlabelled data. As a result, when encountering a rare disease, our Med-MLLM can be rapidly deployed and easily adapted to them with limited labels. Furthermore, our model supports medical data across visual modality (e.g., chest X-ray and CT) and textual modality (e.g., medical report and free-text clinical note); therefore, it can be used for clinical tasks that involve both visual and textual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Med-MLLM by showing how it would perform using the COVID-19 pandemic "in replay". In the retrospective setting, we test the model on the early COVID-19 datasets; and in the prospective setting, we test the model on the new variant COVID-19-Omicron. The experiments are conducted on 1) three kinds of input data; 2) three kinds of downstream tasks, including disease reporting, diagnosis, and prognosis; 3) five COVID-19 datasets; and 4) three different languages, including English, Chinese, and Spanish. All experiments show that our model can make accurate and robust COVID-19 decision-support with little labelled data.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the seminal events since 2019 has been the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Countries have adopted various policies to deal with it, but they also differ in their socio-geographical characteristics and public health care facilities. Our study aimed to investigate differences between epidemiological parameters across countries. METHOD(S): The analysed data represents SARS-CoV-2 repository provided by the Johns Hopkins University. Separately for each country, we estimated recovery and mortality rates using the SIRD model applied to the first 30, 60, 150, and 300 days of the pandemic. Moreover, a mixture of normal distributions was fitted to the number of confirmed cases and deaths during the first 300 days. The estimates of peaks' means and variances were used to identify countries with outlying parameters. RESULT(S): For 300 days Belgium, Cyprus, France, the Netherlands, Serbia, and the UK were classified as outliers by all three outlier detection methods. Yemen was classified as an outlier for each of the four considered timeframes, due to high mortality rates. During the first 300 days of the pandemic, the majority of countries underwent three peaks in the number of confirmed cases, except Australia and Kazakhstan with two peaks. CONCLUSION(S): Considering recovery and mortality rates we observed heterogeneity between countries. Liechtenstein was the "positive" outlier with low mortality rates and high recovery rates, at the opposite, Yemen represented a "negative" outlier with high mortality for all four considered periods and low recovery for 30 and 60 days.Copyright © 2023.

In addition, we coupled the epidemic model with the Logistic growth model to simplify the process of setting model parameters. The model was assessed through experiments and comparisons. Simulation results were analyzed to explore the main factors affecting the spread of the epidemic, and statistical analysis that was applied to assess the model's accuracy. The results are consistent well with epidemic data from Shanghai, China in 2022.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pneumonia that began to spread in 2019 is still raging and has placed a burden on medical systems and governments in various countries. For policymaking and medical resource decisions, a good prediction model is necessary to monitor and evaluate the trends of the epidemic. We used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the improved hybrid model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to predict COVID-19 trends; Methods: The data were collected from the Harvard Dataverse. Epidemic data from 21 January 2020 to 25 April 2021 for California, the most severely affected state in the United States, were used to develop an LSTM model and an EEMD-LSTM hybrid model, which is an LSTM model combined with ensemble empirical mode decomposition. In this study, ninety percent of the data were adopted to fit the models as a training set, while the subsequent 10% were used to test the prediction effect of the models. The mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error were used to evaluate the prediction performances of the models; Results: The results indicated that the number of confirmed cases in California was increasing as of 25 April 2021, with no obvious evidence of a sharp decline. On 25 April 2021, the LSTM model predicted 3666418 confirmed cases, whereas the EEMD-LSTM predicted 3681150. The mean absolute percentage errors for the LSTM and EEMD-LSTM models were 0.0151 and 0.0051, respectively. The mean absolute and root mean square errors were 5.58 x 104 and 5.63 x 104 for the LSTM model and 1.9 x 104 and 2.43 x 104 for the EEMD-LSTM model, respectively; Conclusion(s): The results showed the advantage of an EEMD-LSTM model over a single LSTM model, and the established EEMD-LSTM model may be suitable for monitoring and evaluating the epidemic situation and providing quantitative analysis evidence for epidemic prevention and control.},

The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolution of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop a structure-preserving approximation technique to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.

   abstract = {Performance of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in the early stage of a novel epidemic may be hindered by data availability. Additionally, the traditional SIR model may oversimplify the disease progress, and knowledge about the virus and transmission is limited early in the epidemic, resulting in a greater uncertainty of such modelling. We aimed to investigate the impact of model inputs on the early-stage SIR projection using COVID-19 as an illustration to evaluate the application of early infection models. We constructed a modified SIR model using discrete-time Markov chain to simulate daily epidemic dynamics and estimate the number of beds needed in Wuhan in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic. We compared eight scenarios of SIR projection to the real-world data (RWD) and used root mean square error (RMSE) to assess model performance. According to the National Health Commission, the number of beds occupied in isolation wards and ICUs due to COVID-19 in Wuhan peaked at 37,746. In our model, as the epidemic developed, we observed an increasing daily new case rate, and decreasing daily removal rate and ICU rate. This change in rates contributed to the growth in the needs of bed in both isolation wards and ICUs. Assuming a 50% diagnosis rate and 70% public health efficacy, the model based on parameters estimated using data from the day reaching 3200 to the day reaching 6400 cases returned a lowest RMSE. This model predicted 22,613 beds needed in isolation ward and ICU as on the day of RWD peak. Very early SIR model predictions based on early cumulative case data initially underestimated the number of beds needed, but the RMSEs tended to decline as more updated data were used. Very-early-stage SIR model, although simple but convenient and relatively accurate, is a useful tool to provide decisive information for the public health system and predict the trend of an epidemic of novel infectious disease in the very early stage, thus, avoiding the issue of delay-decision and extra deaths.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Influenza activity is subject to environmental factors. Accurate forecasting of influenza epidemics would permit timely and effective implementation of public health interventions, but it remains challenging. In this study, we aimed to develop random forest (RF) regression models including meterological factors to predict seasonal influenza activity in Jiangsu pro-vine, China. Coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed to evaluate the models' performance. Three RF models with optimum parameters were constructed to predict influenza like illness (ILI) activity, influenza A and B (Flu-A and Flu-B) positive rates in Jiangsu. The models for Flu-B and ILI presented excellent performance with MAPEs <10%. The predicted values of the Flu-A model also matched the real trend very well, although its MAPE reached to 19.49% in the test set. The lagged dependent variables were vital predictors in each model. Seasonality was more pronounced in the models for ILI and Flu-A. The modification effects of the meteorological factors and their lagged terms on the prediction accuracy differed across the three models, while temperature always played an important role. Notably, atmospheric pressure made a major contribution to ILI and Flu-B forecasting. In brief, RF models performed well in influenza activity prediction. Impacts of meteorological factors on the predictive models for influenza activity are type-specific.Copyright © Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2019.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Here, the dynamics of this epidemic is studied by using a generalized logistic function model and extended compartmental models with and without delays. For a chosen population, it is shown as to how forecasting may be done on the spreading of the infection by using a generalized logistic function model, which can be interpreted as a basic compartmental model. In an extended compartmental model, which is a modified form of the SEIQR model, the population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and removed (recovered or dead) compartments, and a set of delay integral equations is used to describe the system dynamics. Time-varying infection rates are allowed in the model to capture the responses to control measures taken, and distributed delay distributions are used to capture variability in individual responses to an infection. The constructed extended compartmental model is a nonlinear dynamical system with distributed delays and time-varying parameters. The critical role of data is elucidated, and it is discussed as to how the compartmental model can be used to capture responses to various measures including quarantining. Data for different parts of the world are considered, and comparisons are also made in terms of the reproductive number. The obtained results can be useful for furthering the understanding of disease dynamics as well as for planning purposes. Copyright © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.},

   abstract = {Measuring the spread of disease during a pandemic is critically important for accurately and promptly applying various lockdown strategies, so to prevent the collapse of the medical system. The latest pandemic of COVID-19 that hits the world death tolls and economy loss very hard, is more complex and contagious than its precedent diseases. The complexity comes mostly from the emergence of asymptomatic patients and relapse of the recovered patients which were not commonly seen during SARS outbreaks. These new characteristics pertaining to COVID-19 were only discovered lately, adding a level of uncertainty to the traditional SEIR models. The contribution of this paper is that for the COVID-19 epidemic, which is infectious in both the incubation period and the onset period, we use neural networks to learn from the actual data of the epidemic to obtain optimal parameters, thereby establishing a nonlinear, self-adaptive dynamic coefficient infectious disease prediction model. On the basis of prediction, we considered control measures and simulated the effects of different control measures and different strengths of the control measures. The epidemic control is predicted as a continuous change process, and the epidemic development and control are integrated to simulate and forecast. Decision-making departments make optimal choices. The improved model is applied to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States, and by comparing the prediction results with the traditional SEIR model, SEAIRD model and adaptive SEAIRD model, it is found that the adaptive SEAIRD model's prediction results of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic data are in good agreement with the actual epidemic curve. For example, from the prediction effect of these 3 different models on accumulative confirmed cases, in terms of goodness of fit, adaptive SEAIRD model (0.99997) = SEAIRD model (0.98548) > Classical SEIR model (0.66837); in terms of error value: adaptive SEAIRD model (198.6563) < < SEAIRD model(4739.8577) < < Classical SEIR model (22,652.796); The objective of this contribution is mainly on extending the current spread prediction model. It incorporates extra compartments accounting for the new features of COVID-19, and fine-tunes the new model with neural network, in a bid of achieving a higher level of prediction accuracy. Based on the SEIR model of disease transmission, an adaptive model called SEAIRD with internal source and isolation intervention is proposed. It simulates the effects of the changing behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. Neural network is applied to achieve a better fit in SEAIRD. Unlike the SEIR model, the adaptive SEAIRD model embraces multi-group dynamics which lead to different evolutionary trends during the epidemic. Through the risk assessment indicators of the adaptive SEAIRD model, it is convenient to measure the severity of the epidemic situation for consideration of different preventive measures. Future scenarios are projected from the trends of various indicators by running the adaptive SEAIRD model. Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.},

   abstract = {The conversion rate between asymptomatic infections and reported/unreported symptomatic infections is a very sensitive parameter for model variables that spread COVID-19. This is important information for follow-up use in screening, prediction, prognostics, contact tracing, and drug development for the COVID-19 pandemic. The model described here suggests that there may not be enough researchers to solve all of these problems thoroughly and effectively, and it requires careful selection of what we are doing and rapid sharing of results and models and optimizing modeling simulations with value to reduce the impact of COVID-19. Exploring simulation modeling will help decision makers make the most informed decisions. In order to fight against the "Delta" virus, the establishment of a line of defense through all-people testing (APT) is not only an effective method summarized from past experience but also one of the best means to effectively cut the chain of epidemic transmission. The effect of large-scale testing has been fully verified in the international community. We developed a practical dynamic infectious disease model-SETPG (A + I) RD + APT by considering the effects of the all-people test (APT). The model is useful for studying effects of screening measures and providing a more realistic modelling with all-people-test strategies, which require everybody in a population to be tested for infection. In prior work, a total of 370 epidemic cases were collected. We collected three kinds of known cases: the cumulative number of daily incidences, daily cumulative recovery, and daily cumulative deaths in Hong Kong and the United States between 22 January 2020 and 13 November 2020 were simulated. In two essential strategies of the integrated SETPG (A + I) RD + APT model, comparing the cumulative number of screenings in derivative experiments based on daily detection capability and tracking system application rate, we evaluated the performance of the timespan required for the basic regeneration number (R0) and real-time regeneration number (R0t) to reach 1; the optimal policy of each experiment is available, and the screening effect is evaluated by screening performance indicators. with the binary encoding screening method, the number of screenings for the target population is 8667 in HK and 1,803,400 in the U.S., including 6067 asymptomatic cases in HK and 1,262,380 in the U.S. as well as 2599 cases of mild symptoms in HK and 541,020 in the U.S.; there were also 8.25 days of screening timespan in HK and 9.25 days of screening timespan required in the U.S. and a daily detectability of 625,000 cases in HK and 6,050,000 cases in the U.S. Using precise tracking technology, number of screenings for the target population is 6060 cases in HK and 1,766,420 cases in the U.S., including 4242 asymptomatic cases in HK and 1,236,494 cases in the U.S. as well as 1818 cases of mild symptoms in HK and 529,926 cases in the U.S. Total screening timespan (TS) is 8.25~9.25 days. According to the proposed infectious dynamics model that adapts to the all-people test, all of the epidemic cases were reported for fitting, and the result seemed more reasonable, and epidemic prediction became more accurate. It adapted to densely populated metropolises for APT on prevention.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   title = {Evaluating Effects of Dynamic Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Guangdong, China},

   abstract = {The emergence of different virus variants, the rapidly changing epidemic, and demands for economic recovery all require continual adjustment and optimization of COVID-19 intervention policies. For the purpose, it is both important and necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of different policies already in-place, which is the basis for optimization. Although some scholars have used epidemiological models, such as susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR), to perform evaluation, they might be inaccurate because those models often ignore the time-varying nature of transmission rate. This study proposes a new scheme to evaluate the efficiency of dynamic COVID-19 interventions using a new model named as iLSEIR-DRAM. First, we improved the traditional LSEIR model by adopting a five-parameter logistic function (Formula presented.) to depict the key parameter of transmission rate. Then, we estimated the parameters by using an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which combines delayed rejection and adaptive metropolis samplers (DRAM). Finally, we developed a new quantitative indicator to evaluate the efficiency of COVID-19 interventions, which is based on parameters in (Formula presented.) and considers both the decreasing degree of the transmission rate and the emerging time of the epidemic inflection point. This scheme was applied to seven cities in Guangdong Province. We found that the iLSEIR-DRAM model can retrace the COVID-19 transmission quite well, with the simulation accuracy being over 95% in all cities. The proposed indicator succeeds in evaluating the historical intervention efficiency and makes the efficiency comparable among different cities. The comparison results showed that the intervention policies implemented in Guangzhou is the most efficient, which is consistent with public awareness. The proposed scheme for efficiency evaluation in this study is easy to implement and may promote precise prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become an urgent and serious global public health crisis. Community engagement is the first line of defense in the fight against infectious diseases, and general practitioners (GPs) play an important role in it. GPs are facing unique challenges from disasters and pandemics in delivering health care. However, there is still no suitable mobile management system that can help GPs collect data, dynamically assess risks, and effectively triage or follow-up with patients with COVID-19. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to design, develop, and deploy a mobile-based decision support system for COVID-19 (DDC19) to assist GPs in collecting data, assessing risk, triaging, managing, and following up with patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): Based on the actual scenarios and the process of patients using health care, we analyzed the key issues that need to be solved and designed the main business flowchart of DDC19. We then constructed a COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model with high recall and clinical interpretability, which was based on a multiclass logistic regression algorithm. Finally, through a 10-fold cross-validation to quantitatively evaluate the risk stratification ability of the model, a total of 2243 clinical data consisting of 36 dimension clinical features from fever clinics were used for training and evaluation of the model. Result(s): DDC19 is composed of three parts: mobile terminal apps for the patient-end and GP-end, and the database system. All mobile terminal devices were wirelessly connected to the back end data center to implement request sending and data transmission. We used low risk, moderate risk, and high risk as labels, and adopted a 10-fold cross-validation method to evaluate and test the COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model in different scenarios (different dimensions of personal clinical data accessible at an earlier stage). The data set dimensions were (2243, 15) when only using the data of patients' demographic information, clinical symptoms, and contact history; (2243, 35) when the results of blood tests were added; and (2243, 36) after obtaining the computed tomography imaging results of the patient. The average value of the three classification results of the macro-area under the curve were all above 0.71 in each scenario. Conclusion(s): DCC19 is a mobile decision support system designed and developed to assist GPs in providing dynamic risk assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 during the outbreak, and the model had a good ability to predict risk levels in any scenario it covered.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

   abstract = {Background: The sudden and unpredictable changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are a serious threat to the occupational stress and mental health of referees worldwide, which has not attracted widespread attention. The mental health of football referees has a certain influence on their job satisfaction or the accuracy of judgments. Method(s): This study constructed a moderated mediation model to explore the buffer factors between occupational stress and mental health in Chinese soccer referees in the early stage of reopening soccer matches during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Data from 317 Chinese soccer referees (aged 19-45) were collected through an online questionnaire in September-October 2022. Occupational stress, mental health, job burnout and perceived social support were measured, and moderated mediation model was analyzed. Result(s): The results of this study showed that occupational stress was negatively correlated with mental health through the mediating effect of job burnout and the moderated effect of perceived social support after controlling for demographic variables. Specifically, the association between occupational stress and mental health was weaker when perceived social support was higher and stronger. Conclusion(s): The results demonstrate that job burnout and perceived social support played important roles in buffering the negative effects of occupational stress on the mental health of Chinese soccer referees in the early stage of reopening soccer matches during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The findings provide implications for mental health interventions in soccer referees during the public health crises.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background & objective: Mathematical modeling is the most scientific technique to understand the evolution of natural phenomena, including the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, these modeling tools have been widely used in epidemiology for predicting risks and decision-making processes. The purpose of this paper is to provide an effective mathematical model for predicting the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Method(s): Our mathematical model is performed according to a SIDR model for infectious diseases. Epidemiological data from four countries; Belgium, Morocco, Netherlands and Russia, are used to validate this model. Also, we have evaluated the efficiency of Morocco's Covid-19 countermeasures and simulated the different relaxation plans in order to predict the effects of relaxation countermeasures. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): In this paper, we developed and validated a new way of data aggregation, modeling and interpretation to predict the spread of Covid-19, evaluate the efficiency of countermeasures and suggest potential scenarios. Our results will be used to keep the spread of Covid-19 under control in the world.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on medical students' mental health in Italy using a repeated cross-sectional survey with a nested longitudinal subsample (first timepoint: 2018; second: 2020/2021). Three research questions (RQs) were investigated. Study 1 (longitudinal sub-sample) explored whether medical students had higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic compared with a pre-pandemic period (RQ1) and what variables were associated with these conditions during the pandemic adjusting for baseline levels (RQ2). Study 2 (repeated cross-sectional data) aimed to examine whether medical students had higher levels of these conditions during the pandemic compared with their same-year peers during a pre-pandemic period (RQ3). In Study 1, higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress were shown during the pandemic (RQ1). Multivariable models highlighted associations between poor mental health and worsening of the judgment of medical school choice, worsened psychological condition due to the pandemic, economic repercussions due to the pandemic, and baseline levels of symptoms (RQ2). In Study 2, our findings reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic, also adjusting for other variables (RQ3). In conclusion, depressive symptoms and stress were greater during the pandemic. The most relevant variables were pandemic-related items and medical school choice judgment.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Recently, various countries from across the globe have been facing the second wave of COVID-19 infections. In order to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease, much effort has been made in terms of mathematical modeling. In this scenario, compartmental models are widely used to simulate epidemics under various conditions. In general, there are uncertainties associated with the reported data, which must be considered when estimating the parameters of the model. In this work, we propose an effective methodology for estimating parameters of compartmental models in multiple wave scenarios by means of a dynamic data segmentation approach. This robust technique allows the description of the dynamics of the disease without arbitrary choices for the end of the first wave and the start of the second. Furthermore, we adopt a time-dependent function to describe the probability of transmission by contact for each wave. We also assess the uncertainties of the parameters and their influence on the simulations using a stochastic strategy. In order to obtain realistic results in terms of the basic reproduction number, a constraint is incorporated into the problem. We adopt data from Germany and Italy, two of the first countries to experience the second wave of infections. Using the proposed methodology, the end of the first wave (and also the start of the second wave) occurred on 166 and 187 days from the beginning of the epidemic, for Germany and Italy, respectively. The estimated effective reproduction number for the first wave is close to that obtained by other approaches, for both countries. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to find good estimates for all parameters. In relation to uncertainties, we show that slight variations in the design variables can give rise to significant changes in the value of the effective reproduction number. The results provide information on the characteristics of the epidemic for each country, as well as elements for decision-making in the economic and governmental spheres.

   abstract = {Modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 remains an open problem for several reasons. One of these concerns the difficulty to model a complex system at a high resolution (fine-grained) level at which the spread can be simulated by taking into account individual features. Agent-based modeling usually needs to find an optimal trade-off between the resolution of the simulation and the population size. Indeed, modeling single individuals usually leads to simulations of smaller populations or the use of meta-populations. In this article, we propose a solution to efficiently model the Covid-19 spread in Lombardy, themost populated Italian region with about ten million people. In particular, the model described in this paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt in literature to model a large population at the single-individual level. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework that implements: i. a scale-free model of the social contacts combining a sociability rate, demographic information, and geographical assumptions; ii. a multi-agent system relying on the actor model and the High-Performance Computing technology to efficiently implement ten million concurrent agents. We simulated the epidemic scenario from January to April 2020 and from August to December 2020, modeling the government's lockdown policies and people's mask-wearing habits. The social modeling approach we propose could be rapidly adapted for modeling future epidemics at their early stage in scenarios where little prior knowledge is available.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 made many countries impose restrictions in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. These restrictions classify the population into the states of a flow network where people are coming and going according to pandemic evolution. A new dynamical model based on flow networks is proposed. The model fits well with the well-known SIR family model and add a new perspective of the evolution of the infected people among the states. This perspective allows to model different scenarios and illustrates the evolution and trends of the pandemic because it is based on the open data daily provided by the governments. To measure the severity of the pandemic along the time, a danger index (DI) is proposed in addition to the well-known R0 index. This index is a function of infected cases, number of deaths and recover cases while the transmission index R0 depends only on the infected cases. These two indexes are compared in relation to data from Spain and the Netherlands and additionally, it is shown the relation of the danger index with the policy applied by the governments.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting COVID-19 trends to support planning and response was a priority for scientists and decision makers alike. In the United States, COVID-19 forecasting was coordinated by a large group of universities, companies, and government entities led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org). We evaluated approximately 9.7 million forecasts of weekly state-level COVID-19 cases for predictions 1-4 weeks into the future submitted by 24 teams from August 2020 to December 2021. We assessed coverage of central prediction intervals and weighted interval scores (WIS), adjusting for missing forecasts relative to a baseline forecast, and used a Gaussian generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate differences in skill across epidemic phases that were defined by the effective reproduction number. Overall, we found high variation in skill across individual models, with ensemble-based forecasts outperforming other approaches. Forecast skill relative to the baseline was generally higher for larger jurisdictions (e.g., states compared to counties). Over time, forecasts generally performed worst in periods of rapid changes in reported cases (either in increasing or decreasing epidemic phases) with 95% prediction interval coverage dropping below 50% during the growth phases of the winter 2020, Delta, and Omicron waves. Ideally, case forecasts could serve as a leading indicator of changes in transmission dynamics. However, while most COVID-19 case forecasts outperformed a naive baseline model, even the most accurate case forecasts were unreliable in key phases. Further research could improve forecasts of leading indicators, like COVID-19 cases, by leveraging additional real-time data, addressing performance across phases, improving the characterization of forecast confidence, and ensuring that forecasts were coherent across spatial scales. In the meantime, it is critical for forecast users to appreciate current limitations and use a broad set of indicators to inform pandemic-related decision making.Copyright © 2024 Public Library of Science.

   journal = {Epidemiology and infection},
   volume = {149},
   pages = {e102},
   abstract = {Estimating the lengths-of-stay (LoS) of hospitalised COVID-19 patients is key for predicting the hospital beds' demand and planning mitigation strategies, as overwhelming the healthcare systems has critical consequences for disease mortality. However, accurately mapping the time-to-event of hospital outcomes, such as the LoS in the intensive care unit (ICU), requires understanding patient trajectories while adjusting for covariates and observation bias, such as incomplete data. Standard methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients' hospitalised, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a non-parametric mixture cure model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward (HW)/ICU LoS to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and HW LoS estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We provided evidence that adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models, together with age is key for accurately forecasting HW and ICU occupancy, as well as discharge or death outcomes.},

   abstract = {Accurate prediction of flu activity enables health officials to plan disease prevention and allocate treatment resources. A promising forecasting approach is to adapt the well-established endemic-epidemic modeling framework to time series of infectious disease proportions. Using U.S. influenza-like illness surveillance data over 18 seasons, we assessed probabilistic forecasts of this new beta autoregressive model with proper scoring rules. Other readily available forecasting tools were used for comparison, including Prophet, (S)ARIMA and kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE). Short-term flu activity was equally well predicted up to four weeks ahead by the beta model with four autoregressive lags and by KCDE; however, the beta model runs much faster. Non-dynamic Prophet scored worst. Relative performance differed for seasonal peak prediction. Prophet produced the best peak intensity forecasts in seasons with standard epidemic curves; otherwise, KCDE outperformed all other methods. Peak timing was best predicted by SARIMA, KCDE or the beta model, depending on the season. The best overall performance when predicting peak timing and intensity was achieved by KCDE. Only KCDE and naive historical forecasts consistently outperformed the equal-bin reference approach for all test seasons. We conclude that the endemic-epidemic beta model is a performant and easy-to-implement tool to forecast flu activity a few weeks ahead. Real-time forecasting of the seasonal peak, however, should consider outputs of multiple models simultaneously, weighing their usefulness as the season progresses.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

We focus on data of the early pandemic progression in Italy and the United States (the U.S.). We perform the analysis for both cases of correlated and uncorrelated inputs.

   abstract = {The world at large has been confronted with several disease outbreak which has posed and still posing a serious menace to public health globally. Recently, COVID-19 a new kind of coronavirus emerge from Wuhan city in China and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. There has been a reported case of about 8622985 with global death of 457,355 as of 15.05 GMT, June 19, 2020. South-Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Ghana are the most affected African countries with this outbreak. Thus, there is a need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence in this region for effective control and management. Different statistical tools and time series model such as the linear regression model and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been applied for disease prevalence/incidence prediction in different diseases outbreak. However, in this study, we adopted the ARIMA model to forecast the trend of COVID-19 prevalence in the aforementioned African countries. The datasets examined in this analysis spanned from February 21, 2020, to June 16, 2020, and was extracted from the World Health Organization website. ARIMA models with minimum Akaike information criterion correction (AICc) and statistically significant parameters were selected as the best models. Accordingly, the ARIMA (0,2,3), ARIMA (0,1,1), ARIMA (3,1,0) and ARIMA (0,1,2) models were chosen as the best models for SA, Nigeria, and Ghana and Egypt, respectively. Forecasting was made based on the best models. It is noteworthy to claim that the ARIMA models are appropriate for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19. We noticed a form of exponential growth in the trend of this virus in Africa in the days to come. Thus, the government and health authorities should pay attention to the pattern of COVID-19 in Africa. Necessary plans and precautions should be put in place to curb this pandemic in Africa.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

   journal = {JMIR public health and surveillance},
   volume = {8},
   number = {6},
   pages = {e37377},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than prior variants of concern (VOCs). It has caused the largest outbreaks in the pandemic, with increases in mortality and hospitalizations. Early data on the spread of Omicron were captured in countries with relatively low case counts, so it was unclear how the arrival of Omicron would impact the trajectory of the pandemic in countries already experiencing high levels of community transmission of Delta. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study is to quantify and explain the impact of Omicron on pandemic trajectories and how they differ between countries that were or were not in a Delta outbreak at the time Omicron occurred. METHOD(S): We used SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and genetic sequence data to classify countries into 2 groups: those that were in a Delta outbreak (defined by at least 10 novel daily transmissions per 100,000 population) when Omicron was first sequenced in the country and those that were not. We used trend analysis, survival curves, and dynamic panel regression models to compare outbreaks in the 2 groups over the period from November 1, 2021, to February 11, 2022. We summarized the outbreaks in terms of their peak rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the duration of time the outbreaks took to reach the peak rate. RESULT(S): Countries that were already in an outbreak with predominantly Delta lineages when Omicron arrived took longer to reach their peak rate and saw greater than a twofold increase (2.04) in the average apex of the Omicron outbreak compared to countries that were not yet in an outbreak. CONCLUSION(S): These results suggest that high community transmission of Delta at the time of the first detection of Omicron was not protective, but rather preluded larger outbreaks in those countries. Outbreak status may reflect a generally susceptible population, due to overlapping factors, including climate, policy, and individual behavior. In the absence of strong mitigation measures, arrival of a new, more transmissible variant in these countries is therefore more likely to lead to larger outbreaks. Alternately, countries with enhanced surveillance programs and incentives may be more likely to both exist in an outbreak status and detect more cases during an outbreak, resulting in a spurious relationship. Either way, these data argue against herd immunity mitigating future outbreaks with variants that have undergone significant antigenic shifts.Copyright ©Alexander L Lundberg, Ramon Lorenzo-Redondo, Judd F Hultquist, Claudia A Hawkins, Egon A Ozer, Sarah B Welch, P V Vara Prasad, Chad J Achenbach, Janine I White, James F Oehmke, Robert L Murphy, Robert J Havey, Lori A Post.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health behavior was conducive to control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. This study aimed to determine the differences in health behaviors and related factors among rural and urban residents in China. METHOD(S): From February 14 to 22, 2020, during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, a total of 2449 participants (1783 (72.81%) urban residents and 666 (27.19%) rural residents) were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and QQ social platforms, both owned by Tencent. Data were collected through the Web-questionnaire guided by an information-motivation-behavioral skills model. The multiple-group structural equation model was applied to analyze the factors. RESULT(S): Rural residents had lower health behavior scores than urban residents, even after adjusting demographic characteristics (33.86 vs 34.29, P = 0.042; total score was 40). Motivational, behavioral skills, and stress had direct positive and negative influences on health behaviors of urban and rural residents. Information and positive perception of interventions had direct effects on health behaviors in rural residents, but not in urban residents. All the factors were mediated by behavioral skills in rural and urban residents. CONCLUSION(S): This study suggests that the government should pay attention to substantial rural and urban disparities and implement different COVID-19 prevention and intervention policies for health behaviors targeting rural and urban residents.},

   abstract = {Objectives: This study explored the factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Method(s): The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. Result(s): Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range: 8-40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62 +/- 4.44. The term 'health risk stress' refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health, and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all seven questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. Conclusion(s): In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {In emergencies similar to virus spreading in an epidemic model, panic can spread in groups, which brings serious bad effects to society. To explore the transmission mechanism and decision-making behavior of panic, a government strategy was proposed in this paper to control the spread of panic. First, based on the SEIR epidemiological model, considering the delay effect between susceptible and exposed individuals and taking the infection rate of panic as a time-varying variable, a SEIR delayed panic spread model was established and the basic regeneration number of the proposed model was calculated. Second, the control strategy was expressed as a state delayed feedback and solved using the exact linearization method of nonlinear control system; the control law for the system was determined, and its stability was proven. The aim was to eradicate panic from the group so that the recovered group tracks the whole group asymptotically. Finally, we simulated the proposed strategy of controlling the spread of panic to illustrate our theoretical results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient surges beyond hospital capacity during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized a need for clinical laboratories to prepare test processes to support future patient care. The objective of this study was to determine if current instrumentation in local hospital laboratories can accommodate the anticipated workload from COVID-19 infected patients in hospitals and a proposed field hospital in addition to testing for non-infected patients. METHOD(S): Simulation models predicted instrument throughput and turn-around-time for chemistry, ion-selective-electrode, and immunoassay tests using vendor-developed software with different workload scenarios. The expanded workload included tests from anticipated COVID patients in 2 local hospitals and a proposed field hospital with a COVID-specific test menu in addition to the pre-pandemic workload. RESULT(S): Instrumentation throughput and turn-around time at each site was predicted. With additional COVID-patient beds in each hospital, the maximum throughput was approached with no impact on turnaround time. Addition of the field hospital workload led to significantly increased test turnaround times at each site. CONCLUSION(S): Simulation models depicted the analytic capacity and turn-around times for laboratory tests at each site and identified the laboratory best suited for field hospital laboratory support during the pandemic.Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

   abstract = {Timely detection of the seasonal influenza epidemic is important for public health action. We introduce FluHMM, a simple but flexible Bayesian algorithm to detect and monitor the seasonal epidemic on sentinel surveillance data. No comparable historical data are required for its use. FluHMM segments a typical influenza surveillance season into five distinct phases with clear interpretation (pre-epidemic, epidemic growth, epidemic plateau, epidemic decline and post-epidemic) and provides the posterior probability of being at each phase for every week in the period under surveillance, given the available data. An alert can be raised when the probability that the epidemic has started exceeds a given threshold. An accompanying R package facilitates the application of this method in public health practice. We apply FluHMM on 12 seasons of sentinel surveillance data from Greece, and show that it achieves very good sensitivity, timeliness and perfect specificity, thereby demonstrating its usefulness. We further discuss advantages and limitations of the method, providing suggestions on how to apply it and highlighting potential future extensions such as with integrating multiple surveillance data streams.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic continues, severe seasonal Influenza (flu) may happen alongside COVID-19. This could cause a "twindemic", in which there are additional burdens on health care resources and public safety compared to those occurring in the presence of a single infection. Amidst the raising trend of co-infections of the two diseases, forecasting both Influenza-like Illness (ILI) outbreaks and COVID-19 waves in a reliable and timely manner becomes more urgent than ever. Accurate and real-time joint prediction of the twindemic aids public health organizations and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. However, in the current pandemic, existing ILI and COVID-19 forecasting models face shortcomings under complex inter-disease dynamics, particularly due to the similarities in symptoms and healthcare-seeking patterns of the two diseases., METHODS: Inspired by the interconnection between ILI and COVID-19 activities, we combine related internet search and bi-disease time series information for the U.S. national level and state level forecasts. Our proposed ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble adopts a new ensemble framework that integrates ILI and COVID-19 disease forecasting models to pool the information between the two diseases and provide joint multi-resolution and multi-target predictions. Through a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion, our framework is able to adaptively select the most predictive COVID-19 or ILI signals., RESULTS: In the retrospective evaluation, our model steadily outperforms alternative benchmark methods, and remains competitive with other publicly available models in both point estimates and probabilistic predictions (including intervals)., CONCLUSIONS: The success of our approach illustrates that pooling information between the ILI and COVID-19 leads to improved forecasting models than individual models for either of the disease.

   title = {Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic by a two-side fractional-order compartmental model},
   journal = {ISA transactions},
   abstract = {Global efforts are focused on discussing effective measures for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on global community. It is clear that the ongoing pandemic of this virus caused an immense threat to public health and economic development. Mathematical models with real data simulations are powerful tools that can identify key factors of pandemic and improve control or mitigation strategies. Compared with integer-order and left-hand side fractional models, two-side fractional models can better capture the state of pandemic spreading. In this paper, two-side fractional models are first proposed to qualitative and quantitative analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. A basic framework are given for the prediction and analysis of infectious diseases by these types of models. By means of asymptotic stability analysis of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, basic reproduction number R0 can be obtained, which is helpful for estimating the severity of an outbreak qualitatively. Sensitivity analysis of R0 is performed to identify and rank key epidemiological parameters. Based on the real data of the United States, numerical tests reveal that the model with both left-hand side fractional derivative and right-hand side fractional integral terms has a better forecast ability for the epidemic trend in the next ten days. Our extensive computational results also quantitatively reveal that non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation, stay at home, strict control of social distancing, and rapid testing can play an important role in preventing the pandemic of the disease. Thus, the two-side fractional models are proposed in this paper can successfully capture the change rule of COVID-19, which provide a strong tool for understanding and analyzing the trend of the outbreak.Copyright © 2022 ISA.

   abstract = {Background: The Delta variant of SARS-COV-2 has replaced previously circulating strains around the world in 2021. Sporadic outbreaks of the Delta variant in China have posed a concern about how to properly respond to the battle against evolving COVID-19. Here, we analyzed the "hierarchical and classified prevention and control (HCPC)" measures strategy deployed during the recent Guangzhou outbreak. Method(s): A modified susceptible-exposed-pre-symptomatic-infectious-recovered (SEPIR) model was developed and applied to study a range of different scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of policy deployment. We simulated severe different scenarios to understand policy implementation and timing of implementation. Two outcomes were measured: magnitude of transmission and duration of transmission. The outcomes of scenario evaluations were presented relative to the reality case (i.e., 368 cases in 34 days) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Result(s): Based on our simulation, the outbreak would become out of control with 7 million estimated infections under the assumption of the absence of any interventions than the 153 reported cases in reality in Guangzhou. The simulation on delayed implementation of interventions showed that the total case numbers would also increase by 166.67%-813.07% if the interventions were delayed by 3 days or 7 days. Conclusion(s): It may be concluded that timely and more precise interventions including mass testing and graded community management are effective measures for Delta variant containment in China.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {It's urgently needed to assess the COVID-19 epidemic under the "dynamic zero-COVID policy" in China, which provides a scientific basis for evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy in COVID-19 control. Here, we developed a time-dependent susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infected-quarantined-removed (SEAIQR) model with stage-specific interventions based on recent Shanghai epidemic data, considering a large number of asymptomatic infectious, the changing parameters, and control procedures. The data collected from March 1st, 2022 to April 15th, 2022 were used to fit the model, and the data of subsequent 7 days and 14 days were used to evaluate the model performance of forecasting. We then calculated the effective regeneration number (Rt) and analyzed the sensitivity of different measures scenarios. Asymptomatic infectious accounts for the vast majority of the outbreaks in Shanghai, and Pudong is the district with the most positive cases. The peak of newly confirmed cases and newly asymptomatic infectious predicted by the SEAIQR model would appear on April 13th, 2022, with 1963 and 28,502 cases, respectively, and zero community transmission may be achieved in early to mid-May. The prediction errors for newly confirmed cases were considered to be reasonable, and newly asymptomatic infectious were considered to be good between April 16th to 22nd and reasonable between April 16th to 29th. The final ranges of cumulative confirmed cases and cumulative asymptomatic infectious predicted in this round of the epidemic were 26,477 ~ 47,749 and 402,254 ~ 730,176, respectively. At the beginning of the outbreak, Rt was 6.69. Since the implementation of comprehensive control, Rt showed a gradual downward trend, dropping to below 1.0 on April 15th, 2022. With the early implementation of control measures and the improvement of quarantine rate, recovery rate, and immunity threshold, the peak number of infections will continue to decrease, whereas the earlier the control is implemented, the earlier the turning point of the epidemic will arrive. The proposed time-dependent SEAIQR dynamic model fits and forecasts the epidemic well, which can provide a reference for decision making of the "dynamic zero-COVID policy".Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {Predicting the outbreak risks and/or the inflection (turning or tipping) points of COVID-19 can be rather challenging. Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID-19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor's power-law) and Ma's population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell's neutral theory, and Ma's diversity-time relationship adapted for the infection-time relationship. Fisher-Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter (b > 2), being significantly higher than the b-values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID-19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold (M0) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak-stage), space (region) and public-health interventions. Exceeding M0, local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections. (iv) The inflection (turning) points, pair of maximal infection number and corresponding time, are successfully predicted in more than 80% of Chinese provinces and 68 countries worldwide, with a precision >80% generally.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as a new threat to humans and spread around the world, leaving a large death toll. As of January 2023, Brazil is among the countries with the highest number of registered deaths. Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions have been heterogeneously implemented in the country, which, associated with large socioeconomic differences between the country regions, has led to distinct virus spread dynamics. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the Pernambuco state (Northeast Brazil) throughout the distinct epidemiological scenarios that unfolded in the first 2 years of the pandemic. We generated a total of 1,389 new SARS-CoV-2 genomes from June 2020 to August 2021. This sampling captured the arrival, communitary transmission, and the circulation of the B1.1, B.1.1.28, and B.1.1.33 lineages; the emergence of the former variant of interest P.2; and the emergence and fast replacement of all previous variants by the more transmissible variant of concern P.1 (Gamma). Based on the incidence and lineage spread pattern, we observed an East-to-West to inner state pattern of transmission, which is in agreement with the transmission of more populous metropolitan areas to medium- and small-size country-side cities in the state. Such transmission patterns may be partially explained by the main routes of traffic across municipalities in the state. Our results highlight that the fine-grained intrastate analysis of lineages and incidence spread can provide actionable insights for planning future nonpharmacological intervention for air-borne transmissible human pathogens.IMPORTANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil was one of the most affected countries, mainly due its continental-size, socioeconomic differences among regions, and heterogeneous implementation of intervention methods. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the state of Pernambuco, we conducted a spatiotemporal dispersion study, covering the period from June 2020 to August 2021, to comprehend the dynamics of viral transmission during the first 2 years of the pandemic. Throughout this study, we were able to track three significant epidemiological waves of transmission caused by B1.1, B.1.1.28, B.1.1.33, P.2, and P.1 lineages. These analyses provided valuable insights into the evolution of the epidemiological landscape, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of virus transmission during the early years of the pandemic in the state of Pernambuco.},

   abstract = {Introduction The reaction between susceptible and infected subjects has been studied under the well-mixed hypothesis for almost a century. Here, we present a consistent analysis for a not well-mixed system using fractal kinetics' principles. Methods We analyzed COVID-19 data to get insights on the disease spreading in absence/presence of preventive measures. We derived a three-parameter model and show that the 'fractal' exponent h of time larger than unity can capture the impact of preventive measures affecting population mobility. Results The h=1 case, which is a power of time model, accurately describes the situation without such measures in line with a herd immunity policy. The pandemic spread in four model countries (France, Greece, Italy and Spain) for the first 10 months has gone through four stages: stages 1 and 3 with limited to no measures, stages 2 and 4 with varying lockdown conditions. For each stage and country two or three model parameters have been determined using appropriate fitting procedures. The fractal kinetics model was found to be more akin to real life. Conclusion Model predictions and their implications lead to the conclusion that the fractal kinetics model can be used as a prototype for the analysis of all contagious airborne pandemics.Copyright © 2021 Macheras P et al.},

   abstract = {Pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has affected to world in several aspects: high number of confirmed cases, high number of deaths, low economic growth, among others. Understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of the virus is helpful and necessary for decision making, for instance to decide where, whether and how, non-pharmaceutical intervention policies are to be applied. This point has not been properly addressed in literature since typical strategies do not consider marked differences on the epidemic spread across country or large territory. Those strategies assume similarities and apply similar interventions instead. This work is focused on posing a methodology where spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics is captured by means of dividing a territory in time-varying epidemic regions, according to geographical closeness and infection level. In addition, a novel Lagrangian-SEIR-based model is posed for describing the dynamic within and between those regions. The capabilities of this methodology for identifying local outbreaks and reproducing the epidemic curve are discussed for the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Jalisco state (Mexico). The contagions from July 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021 are analyzed, with monthly adjustments, and the estimates obtained at the level of the epidemic regions present satisfactory results since Relative Root Mean Squared Error RRMSE is below 15% in most of regions, and at the level of the whole state outstanding with RRMSE below 5%.},

   abstract = {The effectiveness of control measures against the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic is grounded on the assumption that people are prepared and disposed to cooperate. From a strategic decision point of view, cooperation is the unreachable strategy of the prisoner's dilemma game, where the temptation to exploit the others and the fear to be betrayed by them drives the people behavior, which eventually results fully defective. In this work, we integrate the SIRS epidemic model with the replicator equation of evolutionary games in order to study the interplay between the infection spreading and the propensity of people to become cooperative under the pressure of the epidemic. We find that the developed model possesses several steady states, including fully or partially cooperative ones and that the presence of such states allows to take the disease under control. Moreover, assuming a seasonal variation of the infection rate, the system presents rich dynamics, including chaotic behavior and epidemic extinction.

   abstract = {Background: Epidemics can significantly deplete a country's health and financial resources. Risk modeling approaches that quantify the estimated frequency and severity of potential epidemics can inform epidemic preparedness, response, and financing strategies. These methods can aid countries in decision-making for strategic investments of limited resources and identify locations and populations at greatest risk to focus investments where they are most needed. However, such approaches typically have not been available for low- and middle-income countries, where they can have a significant impact. Methods and materials: As part of an innovative outbreak response financing initiative, we created a novel system for quantifying Ebola virus disease epidemic risk in Guinea and Uganda. We developed a risk modeling approach leveraging computational epidemiology, catastrophe modeling, and actuarial methods to construct a synthetic dataset containing nearly 40,000 scientifically-plausible, simulated epidemics. The model incorporates emergence locations, transmission parameters, human population density and mobility, and subnational-resolution epidemic preparedness measures into a stochastic, metapopulation, compartment model that simulates disease spread. The synthetic outbreak data is analyzed to create an exceedance probability (EP) curve, which provides the estimated probability of an event of a given size (e.g., numbers of deaths) or greater occurring in any given year. Result(s): The risk modeling estimates indicate that the annual EP of an Ebola epidemic causing at least 100 deaths in Uganda is near 2.00%. In Guinea, the annual EP of an Ebola epidemic causing at least 2500 deaths (similar to the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic) is 0.64%. The EP curve is most influenced by emergence probability, emergence location, and transmission rate. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, country-specific, modeled metrics of Ebola frequency and severity have not previously been published, pointing to the innovation of our methods. Our approach allows countries to assess whether their internal capacities are sufficient to respond to epidemics of different sizes. Countries can also use our approach to quantify the epidemic size at which internal capacity is likely to be exceeded and external assistance would be needed. This information can enable policymakers to optimize resource allocation and investments in health workforce, surveillance systems, and contingent financing to protect against health security threats.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {The propagation of the new pandemic COVID-19 is more likely linked to human social relations and activities. A social network can be used to describe these human relationships and activities. Understanding the dynamic properties of disease dissemination through diverse social networks is critical for effective and efficient infection prevention and control. With the frequent emergence and spread of infectious diseases and their impact on large areas of the population, there is growing interest in modelling these complex epidemic behaviour. Such an approach could provide a stronger decision-making method to tackle and control disease. In this paper, a transmission network is developed using the South Korean data, and the study of the network is carried out using graph energy centrality. This measure of centrality allows us to recognise the primary cause of the spread of the virus within the established network by ranking the nodes of the network based on graph energy. The identified primary cause can then be isolated, which can prevent further spread of infection. We have also considered the Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset from Johns Hopkins University to analyse epidemiological data around the world.Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

   volume = {156},
   pages = {111785},
   abstract = {Phenomenological and deterministic models are often used for the estimation of transmission parameters in an epidemic and for the prediction of its growth trajectory. Such analyses are usually based on single peak outbreak dynamics. In light of the present COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to better understand observed epidemic growth with multiple peak structures, preferably using first-principles methods. Along the lines of our previous work [Physica A 574, 126014 (2021)], here we apply 2D random-walk Monte Carlo calculations to better understand COVID-19 spread through contact interactions. Lockdown scenarios and all other control interventions are imposed through mobility restrictions and a regulation of the infection rate within the stochastically interacting population. The susceptible, infected and recovered populations are tracked over time, with daily infection rates obtained without recourse to the solution of differential equations. The simulations were carried out for population densities corresponding to four countries, India, Serbia, South Africa and USA. In all cases our results capture the observed infection growth rates. More importantly, the simulation model is shown to predict secondary and tertiary waves of infections with reasonable accuracy. This predictive nature of multiple wave structures provides a simple and effective tool that may be useful in planning mitigation strategies during the present pandemic.

This study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from patients' day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO2, age, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for various medical assignments and patient triage.},

   abstract = {Infectious disease models can be of great use for understanding the underlying mechanisms that influence the spread of diseases and predicting future disease progression. Modeling has been increasingly used to evaluate the potential impact of different control measures and to guide public health policy decisions. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in developing spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and an example of such recent developments is the discrete-time individual-level models (ILMs). These models are well developed and provide a common framework for modeling many disease systems; however, they assume the probability of disease transmission between two individuals depends only on their spatial separation and not on their spatial locations. In cases where spatial location itself is important for understanding the spread of emerging infectious diseases and identifying their causes, it would be beneficial to incorporate the effect of spatial location in the model. In this study, we thus generalize the ILMs to a new class of geographically dependent ILMs, to allow for the evaluation of the effect of spatially varying risk factors (e.g., education, social deprivation, environmental), as well as unobserved spatial structure, upon the transmission of infectious disease. Specifically, we consider a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to capture the effects of unobserved spatially structured latent covariates or measurement error. This results in flexible infectious disease models that can be used for formulating etiological hypotheses and identifying geographical regions of unusually high risk to formulate preventive action. The reliability of these models is investigated on a combination of simulated epidemic data and Alberta seasonal influenza outbreak data ($2009$). This new class of models is fitted to data within a Bayesian statistical framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.Copyright © Crown copyright 2020.

   abstract = {The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting with an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

   abstract = {In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of epidemiological modelling approaches were used to predict the effective reproduction number, R(t), and other COVID-19-related measures such as the daily rate of exponential growth, r(t). These candidate models use different modelling approaches or differing assumptions about spatial or age-mixing, and some capture genuine uncertainty in scientific understanding of disease dynamics. Combining estimates using appropriate statistical methodology from multiple candidate models is important to better understand the variation of these outcome measures to help inform decision-making. In this paper, we combine estimates for specific UK nations/regions using random-effects meta-analyses techniques, utilising the restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) method to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, and two approaches to calculate the confidence interval for the combined estimate: the standard Wald-type and the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. As estimates in this setting are derived using model predictions, each with varying degrees of uncertainty, equal-weighting is favoured over the standard inverse-variance weighting to avoid potential up-weighting of models providing estimates with lower levels of uncertainty that are not fully accounting for inherent uncertainties. Both equally-weighted models using REML alone and REML+KNHA approaches were found to provide similar variation for R(t) and r(t), with both approaches providing wider, and therefore more conservative, confidence intervals around the combined estimate compared to the standard inverse-variance weighting approach. Utilising these meta-analysis techniques has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for key COVID-19 outcome measures. This in turn allows timely and informed decision-making based on all available information.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.},

   abstract = {Since December 2019, the world has witnessed the stringent effect of an unprecedented global pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of January 29,2021, there have been 100,819,363 confirmed cases and 2,176,159 deaths reported. Among the countries affected severely by COVID-19, the United States tops the list. Research has been conducted to discuss the causal associations between explanatory factors and COVID-19 transmission in the contiguous United States. However, most of these studies focus more on spatial associations of the estimated parameters, yet exploring the time-varying dimension in spatial econometric modeling appears to be utmost essential. This research adopts various relevant approaches to explore the potential effects of driving factors on COVID-19 counts in the contiguous United States. A total of three global spatial regression models and two local spatial regression models, the latter including geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR), are performed at the county scale to take into account the scale effects. For COVID-19 cases, ethnicity, crime, and income factors are found to be the strongest covariates and explain most of the variance of the modeling estimation. For COVID-19 deaths, migration (domestic and international) and income factors play a critical role in explaining spatial differences of COVID-19 deaths across counties. Such associations also exhibit temporal variations from March to July, as supported by better performance of MGWR than GWR. Both global and local associations among the parameters vary highly over space and change across time. Therefore, time dimension should be paid more attention to in the spatial epidemiological analysis. Among the two local spatial regression models, MGWR performs more accurately, as it has slightly higher Adj. R2 values (for cases, R2=0.961; for deaths, R2=0.962), compared to GWR's Adj. R2 values (for cases, R2=0.954; for deaths, R2=0.954). To inform policy-makers at the nation and state levels, understanding the place-based characteristics of the explanatory forces and related spatial patterns of the driving factors is of paramount importance. Since it is not the first time humans are facing public health emergency, the findings of the present research on COVID-19 therefore can be used as a reference for policy designing and effective decision making.

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {809877},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 has wreaked havoc upon the world with over 248 million confirmed cases and a death toll of over 5 million. It is alarming that the United States contributes over 18% of these confirmed cases and 14% of the deaths. Researchers have proposed many forecasting models to predict the spread of COVID-19 at the national, state, and county levels. However, due to the large variety in the mitigation policies adopted by various state and local governments; and unpredictable social events during the pandemic, it is incredibly challenging to develop models that can provide accurate long-term forecasting for disease spread. In this paper, to address such a challenge, we introduce a new multi-period curve fitting model to give a short-term prediction of the COVID-19 spread in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) within the United States. Since most counties/cities within a single MSA usually adopt similar mitigation strategies, this allows us to substantially diminish the variety in adopted mitigation strategies within an MSA. At the same time, the multi-period framework enables us to incorporate the impact of significant social events and mitigation strategies in the model. We also propose a simple heuristic to estimate the COVID-19 fatality based on our spread prediction. Numerical experiments show that the proposed multi-period curve model achieves reasonably high accuracy in the prediction of the confirmed cases and fatality.Copyright © 2022 Majeed, Li, Peng and Lin.},

   abstract = {A pandemic is a disease that spreads across a large area like multiple continents or worldwide. More than 211 nations are already affected by Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 declared Covid19 a pandemic. There are more than 1,282,931 cases of the coronavirus illness over 211 countries and territories around the world. Currently coronavirus has no proper treatment in Medical Science, increasing the number of affected people day by day with the number of cases worldwide of novel coronavirus surpassing 1,282,931, with some 72,616 deaths approximately. That is why the main objective of the present investigation is to identify the significant risk factor. Also, in this study we are continuously monitoring the spread of coronavirus. In this study we use a new TOPSIS MCDM approach and GMDH apply to select the significant risk factor and continuous monitoring of death due to Covid-19. Result indicates that "contamination due to contact with the infected person" is the main responsible factor behind the pandemic COVID-19. Also, in this investigation we get an optimal model by which we can monitor the death from Coronavirus within the affected person continuously.Copyright © 2020 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum Ltd., UK.},

   journal = {Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {26-33},
   abstract = {Background: Ever since the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in China, there has been several attempts to predict the epidemic across the world with varying degrees of accuracy and reliability. This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and selected high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models. Method(s): We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions. Result(s): The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020. As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of about 149 daily new cases after the lock down period, which is statistically not significant. Conclusion(s): The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems. The study also suggests that there is no evidence to conclude that there is a positive impact of lockdown in terms of reduction in new cases.Copyright © 2020 INDIACLEN.

   abstract = {Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses from the Coronaviridae family affecting neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory systems. In late 2019 a new member of this family belonging to the Betacoronavirus genera (referred to as COVID-19) originated and spread quickly across the world calling for strict containment plans and policies. In most countries in the world, the outbreak of the disease has been serious and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased daily, while, fortunately the recovered COVID-19 cases have also increased. Clearly, forecasting the "confirmed" and "recovered" COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models. In this paper, we use this family of models to analyze the real world time series data of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 remains a complex disease in terms of its trajectory and the diversity of outcomes rendering disease management and clinical resource allocation challenging. Varying symptomatology in older patients as well as limitation of clinical scoring systems have created the need for more objective and consistent methods to aid clinical decision making. In this regard, machine learning methods have been shown to enhance prognostication, while improving consistency. However, current machine learning approaches have been limited by lack of generalisation to diverse patient populations, between patients admitted at different waves and small sample sizes., OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether machine learning models, derived on routinely collected clinical data, can generalise well i) between European countries, ii) between European patients admitted at different COVID-19 waves, and iii) between geographically diverse patients, namely whether a model derived on the European patient cohort can be used to predict outcomes of patients admitted to Asian, African and American ICUs., METHODS: We compare Logistic Regression, Feed Forward Neural Network and XGBoost algorithms to analyse data from 3,933 older patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in predicting three outcomes, namely: ICU mortality, 30-day mortality and patients at low risk of deterioration. The patients were admitted to ICUs located in 37 countries, between January 11, 2020, and April 27, 2021., RESULTS: The XGBoost model derived on the European cohort and externally validated in cohorts of Asian, African, and American patients, achieved AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.89-0.89) in predicting ICU mortality, AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.86-0.86) for 30-day mortality prediction and AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.86-0.86) in predicting low-risk patients. Similar AUC performance was achieved also when predicting outcomes between European countries and between pandemic waves, while the models showed high calibration quality. Furthermore, saliency analysis showed that FiO2 values of up to 40% do not appear to increase the predicted risk of ICU and 30-day mortality, while PaO2 values of 75 mmHg or lower are associated with a sharp increase in the predicted risk of ICU and 30-day mortality. Lastly, increase in SOFA scores also increase the predicted risk, but only up to a value of 8. Beyond these scores the predicted risk remains consistently high., CONCLUSION: The models captured both the dynamic course of the disease as well as similarities and differences between the diverse patient cohorts, enabling prediction of disease severity, identification of low-risk patients and potentially supporting effective planning of essential clinical resources., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04321265.

   abstract = {Mauritius stands as one of the few countries in the world to have controlled the current pandemic, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) to a significant extent in a relatively short lapse of time. Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors. Such findings will subsequently encourage the policymakers to implement strict precautionary measures in terms of constant upgrading of the current health care and wellness system and re-enforcement of sanitary obligations.},

   journal = {One Health},
   volume = {15},
   pages = {100427},
   abstract = {The burden of arbovirus diseases in Brazil has increased within the past decade due to the emergence of chikungunya and Zika and endemic circulation of all four dengue serotypes. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns may alter conditions to favor vector-host transmission and allow for cyclic re-emergence of disease. We sought to determine the impact of climate conditions on arbovirus co-circulation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We assessed the spatial and temporal distributions of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika cases from Brazil's national notifiable disease information system (SINAN) and created autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) to predict arbovirus incidence accounting for the lagged effect of temperature and rainfall. Each year, we estimate that the combined arboviruses were associated with an average of 8429 to 10,047 lost Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). After controlling for temperature and precipitation, our model predicted a three cycle pattern where large arbovirus outbreaks appear to be primed by a smaller scale surge and followed by a lull of cases. These dynamic arbovirus patterns in Rio de Janeiro support a mechanism of susceptibility enhancement until the theoretical threshold of population immunity allows for temporary cross protection among certain arboviruses. This suspected synergy presents a major public health challenge due to overlapping locations and seasonality of arbovirus diseases, which may perpetuate disease burden and overwhelm the health system.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {The ongoing highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has now become a global public health problem. Using publicly available data from the COVID-19 data repository of Our World in Data, we aimed to in-vestigate the influences of spatial socio-economic vulnerabilities and neighbourliness on the COVID-19 burden in African countries. We analyzed the first wave (January-September 2020) and second wave (October 2020 to May 2021) of the COVID-19 pandemic using spatial statistics regression models. As of 31 May 2021, there was a total of 4,748,948 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with an average, median, and range per country of 101,041, 26,963, and 2191 to 1,665,617, respectively. We found that COVID-19 prevalence in an Africa country was highly dependent on those of neighbour-ing Africa countries as well as its economic wealth, transparency, and proportion of the population aged 65 or older (p-value < 0.05). Our finding regarding the high COVID-19 burden in countries with better transparency and higher economic wealth is surprising and counterintuitive. We believe this is a reflection on the differences in COVID-19 testing capacity, which is mostly higher in more developed countries, or data modification by less transparent governments. Country-wide inte-grated COVID suppression strategies such as limiting human mobility from more urbanized to less urbanized countries, as well as an understanding of a county's social-economic characteristics, could prepare a country to promptly and effectively respond to future outbreaks of highly contagious viral infections such as COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   journal = {Mathematical Biosciences},
   volume = {329},
   pages = {108466},
   abstract = {In the paper, we propose a semiparametric framework for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic. The stochastic part of the framework is based on Bayesian inference. The model is informed by the actual COVID-19 data and the current epidemiological findings about the disease. The framework combines many available data sources (number of positive cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, etc.) to make outputs as accurate as possible and incorporates the times of non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions which were adopted worldwide to slow-down the pandemic. The model estimates the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the number of infected individuals and the number of patients in different disease progression states in time. It can be used for estimating current infection fatality rate, proportion of individuals not detected and short term forecasting of important indicators for monitoring the state of the healthcare system. With the prediction of the number of patients in hospitals and intensive care units, policy makers could make data driven decisions to potentially avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system. The model is applied to Slovene COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of the adopted interventions for controlling the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that the proportion of infected people in Slovenia was among the lowest in Europe (0.350%, 90% CI [0.245-0.573]%), that infection fatality rate in Slovenia until the end of first wave was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94-2.21]%) and the proportion of unidentified cases was 88% (90% CI [83-93]%). The proposed framework can be extended to more countries/regions, thus allowing for comparison between them. One such modification is exhibited on data for Slovene hospitals.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {Background COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we predict the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity. Methods The infection fatality ratios (IFR) were predicted by adjusting reported IFR for China, accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions and increases in health system capacity. Findings The predicted population-level IFR in Malawi, adjusted for age and comorbidity prevalence, is lower than that estimated for China (0.26%, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12%-0.69%, compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% to 1.3% in China); however, the health system constraints increase the predicted IFR to 0.83%, 95% UI 0.49%-1.39%. The interventions implemented in January 2021 could potentially avert 54 400 deaths (95% UI 26 900-97 300) over the course of the epidemic compared with an unmitigated outbreak. Enhanced shielding of people aged >=60 years could avert 40 200 further deaths (95% UI 25 300-69 700) and halve intensive care unit admissions at the peak of the outbreak. A novel therapeutic agent which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases, respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity, could reduce projected mortality to 2.5 deaths per 1000 population (95% UI 1.9-3.6). Conclusion We find the interventions currently used in Malawi are unlikely to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission but will have a significant impact on mortality. Increases in health system capacity and the introduction of novel therapeutics are likely to further reduce the projected numbers of deaths.Copyright ©},

   abstract = {As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in different parts of India, a reliable forecast for the cumulative confirmed cases and the number of deaths can be helpful for policymakers in making the decisions for utilizing available resources in the country. Recently, various mathematical models have been used to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide and also in India. In this article we use exponential, logistic, Gompertz growth and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India after the announcement of various unlock phases. The mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error comparative measures were used to check the goodness-of-fit of the growth models and Akaike information criterion for ARIMA model selection. Using COVID-19 pandemic data up to 20 December 2020 from India and its five most affected states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala), we report 15-days-ahead forecasts for cumulative confirmed cases and the number of deaths. Based on available data, we found that the ARIMA model is the best-fitting model for COVID-19 cases in India and its most affected states.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maps of the temporal evolution of the regional distribution of a health-related measure enable public health-relevant assessments of health outcomes., OBJECTIVES: The paper introduces the concept of standardized case fatality rate (sCFR). It describes the ratio of the regional variation in mortality to the regional variation in the documented infection process. The regional sCFR values are presented in maps and the time-varying regional heterogeneity observed in them is interpreted., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The regional sCFR is the quotient of the regional standardized mortality and case rate. It is estimated using a bivariate model. The sCFR values presented in maps are based on SARS-CoV-2 reporting data from Bavaria since the beginning of April 2020 until the end of March 2021. Four quarters (Q2/20, Q3/20, Q4/20, and Q1/21) are considered., RESULTS: In the quarters considered, the naive CFR values in Bavaria are 5.0%, 0.5%, 2.5%, and 2.8%. In Q2/20, regional sCFR values are irregularly distributed across the state. This heterogeneity weakens in the second wave of the epidemic. In Q1/21, only isolated regions with elevated sCFR (>1.25) appear in southern Bavaria. Clusters of regions with sCFR >1.25 form in northern Bavaria, with Oberallgau being the region with the lowest sCFR (0.39, 95% credibility interval: 0.25-0.55)., CONCLUSIONS: In Bavaria, heterogeneous regional SARS-CoV-2-specific sCFR values are shown to change over time. They estimate the relative risk of dying from or with COVID-19 as a documented case. Strong small-scale variability in sCFR suggests a preference for regional over higher-level measures to manage the incidence of infection. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-income working-age US adults disproportionately experienced health care disruptions at the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Little is known about how health care access and cardiovascular risk factor management changed as the pandemic went on or if patterns differed by state Medicaid expansion status. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional data from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system were used to compare self-reported measures of health care access and cardiovascular risk factor management among US adults aged 18 to 64 years in 2021 (pandemic) to 2019 (prepandemic) using multivariable Poisson regression models. We assessed differential changes between low-income (<138% federal poverty level) and high-income (>400% federal poverty level) working-age adults by including an interaction term for income group and year. We then evaluated changes among low-income adults in Medicaid expansion versus nonexpansion states using a similar approach. RESULT(S): The unweighted study population included 80 767 low-income and 184 136 high-income adults. Low-income adults experienced improvements in insurance coverage (relative risk [RR], 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08-1.12]), access to a provider (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.09-1.14]), and ability to afford care (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.09]) in 2021 compared with 2019. While these measures also improved for high-income adults, gains in coverage and ability to afford care were more pronounced among low-income adults. However, routine visits (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]) and cholesterol testing (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.96]) decreased for low-income adults, while diabetes screening (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.95-1.08]) remained stable. Treatment for hypertension (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]) increased, and diabetes-focused visits and insulin use remained stable. These patterns were similar for high-income adults. Across most outcomes, there were no differential changes between low-income adults residing in Medicaid expansion versus nonexpansion states. CONCLUSION(S): In this national study of working-age adults in the United States, measures of health care access improved for low- and high-income adults in 2021. However, routine outpatient visits and cardiovascular risk factor screening did not return to prepandemic levels, while risk factor treatment remained stable. As many coronavirus disease-era safety net policies come to an end, targeted strategies are needed to protect health care access and improve cardiovascular risk factor screening for working-age adults.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

   journal = {One Health},
   volume = {13},
   pages = {100355},
   abstract = {Understanding variations in the severity of infectious diseases is essential for planning proper mitigation strategies. Determinants of COVID-19 clinical severity are commonly assessed by transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility, as more infected also lead to more deaths. Instead, we use epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure that accounts for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of population-averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r), is independent of the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number), and has a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic, medical, meteorological, and environmental factors associated with the disease severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component Analysis, followed by univariate, and multivariate analyses based on machine learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. The usefulness of the introduced severity measure and the validity of the approach are confirmed by the fact that, without using prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover the main significant predictors known to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously hypothesized) significant predictors. The proposed measure is applicable for inferring severity determinants not only of COVID-19 but also of other infectious diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of the present and future epidemics. Our holistic, systematic investigation of disease severity at the human-environment intersection by epidemiological dynamical modeling and machine learning ecological regressions is aligned with the One Health approach. The obtained results emphasize a syndemic nature of COVID-19 risks.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {There are currently intensified efforts by the scientific community world-wide to analyze the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to predict key epidemiological effects and assist the proper planning for its clinical management, as well as guide sociopolitical decision-making regarding proper mitigation measures. Most efforts follow variants of the established SIR methodological framework that divides a population into "Susceptible", "Infectious" and "Recovered/Removed" fractions and defines their dynamic inter-relationships with first-order differential equations., GOAL: This paper proposes a novel approach based on data-guided detection and concatenation of infection waves - each of them described by a Riccati equation with adaptively estimated parameters., METHODS: This approach was applied to Covid-19 daily time-series data of US confirmed cases, resulting in the decomposition of the epidemic time-course into five "Riccati modules" representing major infection waves to date (June 18th)., RESULTS: Four waves have passed the time-point of peak infection rate, with the fifth expected to peak on July 20th. The obtained parameter estimates indicate gradual reduction of infectivity rate, although the latest wave is expected to be the largest., CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that, if no new waves of infection emerge, the Covid-19 epidemic will be controlled in the US (<5000 new daily cases) by September 26th, and the maximum of confirmed cases will reach 4,160,000. Importantly, this approach can be used to detect (via rigorous statistical methods) the emergence of possible new waves of infections in the future. Analysis of data from individual states or countries may quantify the distinct effects of different mitigation measures.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed barriers to a healthy lifestyle, especially for older adults who are considered to be at a high-risk of infection. This study examined the associations between negative changes and the self-classification to COVID-19 risk level among physically active older adults who are members of a nationwide health club chain. A cross-sectional digital survey was sent to 19,160 older adults (age >= 65). The data collected included information on the subjects' self-classification to the COVID-19 high-risk group (HRG) and changes in physical activity (PA), body weight, and smoking habits since the outbreak. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between the dependent variables of 'experienced a negative change' and the independent variables. Of the 1670 survey respondents, 78.3% classified themselves as COVID-19 HRG. Over half of the respondents reported a reduction in PA hours, 26.6% reported weight gain, and 17.7% of smokers increased their amount of smoking. A self-classification to the HRG was associated with 1.46 (95%CI 1.10-1.93, p < 0.009) and 1.67 (95%CI 1.21-2.31, p < 0.002) greater odds for reduced hours of exercise and weight gain compared to the not high-risk group, respectively. Decision makers should consider how policies may cause barriers to a healthy lifestyle and develop risk communication strategies to encourage positive health-related behaviors, even during a pandemic.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Background:In anticipation of a demand surge for hospital beds attributed to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) many US states have mandated that hospitals postpone elective admissions. Objective(s):To estimate excess demand for hospital beds due to COVID-19, the net financial impact of eliminating elective admissions in order to meet demand, and to explore the scenario when demand remains below capacity.Research Design:An economic simulation to estimate the net financial impact of halting elective admissions, combining epidemiological reports, the US Census, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the National Inpatient Sample. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored the results while varying assumptions for demand and capacity.Subjects:Inputs regarding disease prevalence and inpatient utilization were representative of the US population. Our base case relied on a hospital admission rate reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 137.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (378.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (207.4 per 100,000). On average, elective admissions accounted for 20% of total hospital admissions, and the average rate of unoccupied beds across hospitals was 30%.Measures:Net financial impact of halting elective admissions. Result(s):On average, hospitals COVID-19 demand for hospital bed-days fell well short of hospital capacity, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net financial impact of a 90-day COVID surge on a hospital was only favorable under a narrow circumstance when capacity was filled by a high proportion of COVID-19 cases among hospitals with low rates of elective admissions. Conclusion(s):Hospitals that restricted elective care took on a substantial financial risk, potentially threatening viability. A sustainable public policy should therefore consider support to hospitals that responsibly served their communities through the crisis.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

   abstract = {Predicting the magnitude of the annual seasonal peak in influenza-like illness (ILI)-related emergency department (ED) visit volumes can inform the decision to open influenza care clinics (ICCs), which can mitigate pressure at the ED. Using ILI-related ED visit data from the Alberta Real Time Syndromic Surveillance Net for Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, we developed (training data, 1 August 2004-31 July 2008) and tested (testing data, 1 August 2008-19 February 2014) spatio-temporal statistical prediction models of daily ILI-related ED visits to estimate high visit volumes 3 days in advance. Our Main Model, based on a generalised linear mixed model with random intercept, incorporated prediction residuals over 14 days and captured increases in observed volume ahead of peaks. During seasonal influenza periods, our Main Model predicted volumes within +/-30% of observed volumes for 67%-82% of high-volume days and within 0.3%-21% of observed seasonal peak volumes. Model predictions were not as successful during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our model can provide early warning of increases in ILI-related ED visit volumes during seasonal influenza periods of differing intensities. These predictions may be used to support public health decisions, such as if and when to open ICCs, during seasonal influenza epidemics.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Introduction: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) encompasses a wide spectrum of symptoms, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematological, and dermatological manifestations. The virus interaction with cells located in the respiratory tract causes the release of inflammatory mediators, whose involvement could be exacerbated by co-existing obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. Objectives: the objective of this research was to analyze the clinically metabolic status in patients who have suffered COVID-19 disease in order to predict the outcome. Methods: this research is a retrospective study based on a cohort of 165 consecutively admitted patients with criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia according to WHO guidelines at the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro between March and April 2020. Recorded variables included demographic and epidemiological data plus diagnoses as well as morbid complications during hospitalization. The Biochemistry Unit Laboratory carried out laboratory analyses according to validated operational procedures. The statistical tests included univariate and multivariate models adjusted for baseline characteristics and clinically relevant features. Results: the most frequent comorbidity in our cohort was arterial hypertension (44.0 %), followed by dyslipidemia (32.1 %), obesity (30.9 %), and diabetes mellitus (20.0 %). The association between admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with body mass index (BMI) in a multivariate model was statistically significant, evidencing that obese subjects (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) have a 19 % higher risk of requiring ICU care. The univariate model revealed a statistically significant association between obesity and ICU admission and length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The relationship between baseline blood glucose and in-hospital mortality was also statistically significant (p = 0.03), as well as with total cholesterol and ICU admission (p = 0.007). Conclusions : obesity is related to a longer time of hospitalization and a higher rate of admissions to the ICU. Low total cholesterol levels and abnormal baseline blood glucose were risk factors for ICU requirement and in-hospital mortality. Patient categorization based on obesity could be valuable in the development of a precision medicine model within the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {The emergence of COVID-19 requires new effective tools for epidemiological surveillance. Spatio-temporal disease mapping models, which allow dealing with small units of analysis, are a priority in this context. These models provide geographically detailed and temporally updated overviews of the current state of the pandemic, making public health interventions more effective. These models also allow estimating epidemiological indicators highly demanded for COVID-19 surveillance, such as the instantaneous reproduction number Rt , even for small areas. In this paper, we propose a new spatio-temporal spline model particularly suited for COVID-19 surveillance, which allows estimating and monitoring Rt for small areas. We illustrate our proposal on the study of the disease pandemic in two Spanish regions. As a result, we show how tourism flows have shaped the spatial distribution of the disease in these regions. In these case studies, we also develop new epidemiological tools to be used by regional public health services for small area surveillance. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in early 2020. A comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of this virus is crucial to limit its spreading. Therefore, this research applies artificial intelligence-based models to predict the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. These models are long short-term memory network (LSTM), convolutional neural network, and multilayer perceptron neural network. They are trained and validated using the dataset records from 14 February 2020 to 15 August 2020. The results of the models are evaluated using the determination coefficient and root mean square error. The LSTM model exhibits the best performance in forecasting the cumulative infections for one week and one month ahead. Finally, the LSTM model with the optimal parameter values is applied to forecast the spread of this epidemic for one month ahead using the data from 14 February 2020 to 30 June 2021. The total size of infections, recoveries, and deaths is estimated to be 285,939, 234,747, and 17,251 cases on 31 July 2021.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new multi-organ disease causing considerable worldwide morbidity and mortality. While many recognized pathophysiological mechanisms are involved, their exact causal relationships remain opaque. Better understanding is needed for predicting their progression, targeting therapeutic approaches, and improving patient outcomes. While many mathematical causal models describe COVID-19 epidemiology, none have described its pathophysiology. METHOD(S): In early 2020, we began developing such causal models. The SARS-CoV-2 virus's rapid and extensive spread made this particularly difficult: no large patient datasets were publicly available; the medical literature was flooded with sometimes conflicting pre-review reports; and clinicians in many countries had little time for academic consultations. We used Bayesian network (BN) models, which provide powerful calculation tools and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as comprehensible causal maps. Hence, they can incorporate both expert opinion and numerical data, and produce explainable, updatable results. To obtain the DAGs, we used extensive expert elicitation (exploiting Australia's exceptionally low COVID-19 burden) in structured online sessions. Groups of clinical and other specialists were enlisted to filter, interpret and discuss the literature and develop a current consensus. We encouraged inclusion of theoretically salient latent (unobservable) variables, likely mechanisms by extrapolation from other diseases, and documented supporting literature while noting controversies. Our method was iterative and incremental: systematically refining and validating the group output using one-on-one follow-up meetings with original and new experts. 35 experts contributed 126 hours face-to-face, and could review our products. RESULT(S): We present two key models, for the initial infection of the respiratory tract and the possible progression to complications, as causal DAGs and BNs with corresponding verbal descriptions, dictionaries and sources. These are the first published causal models of COVID-19 pathophysiology. CONCLUSION(S): Our method demonstrates an improved procedure for developing BNs via expert elicitation, which other teams can implement to model emergent complex phenomena. Our results have three anticipated applications: (i) freely disseminating updatable expert knowledge; (ii) guiding design and analysis of observational and clinical studies; (iii) developing and validating automated tools for causal reasoning and decision support. We are developing such tools for the initial diagnosis, resource management, and prognosis of COVID-19, parameterized using the ISARIC and LEOSS databases.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Projects such as the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub publish forecasts on the national level for new deaths, new cases, and hospital admissions, but not direct measurements of hospital strain like critical care bed occupancy at the sub-national level, which is of particular interest to health professionals for planning purposes. We present a sub-national French framework for forecasting hospital strain based on a non-Markovian compartmental model, its associated online visualisation tool and a retrospective evaluation of the real-time forecasts it provided from January to December 2021 by comparing to three baselines derived from standard statistical forecasting methods (a naive model, auto-regression, and an ensemble of exponential smoothing and ARIMA). In terms of median absolute error for forecasting critical care unit occupancy at the two-week horizon, our model only outperformed the naive baseline for 4 out of 14 geographical units and underperformed compared to the ensemble baseline for 5 of them at the 90% confidence level (n = 38). However, for the same level at the 4 week horizon, our model was never statistically outperformed for any unit despite outperforming the baselines 10 times spanning 7 out of 14 geographical units. This implies modest forecasting utility for longer horizons which may justify the application of non-Markovian compartmental models in the context of hospital-strain surveillance for future pandemics.Copyright © 2024 Massey et al.

   journal = {Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine},
   volume = {211},
   pages = {106399},
   abstract = {Background and objectives: Epidemiological models of epidemic spread are an essential tool for optimizing decision-making. The current literature is very extensive and covers a wide variety of deterministic and stochastic models. However, with the increase in computing resources, new, more general, and flexible procedures based on simulation models can assess the effectiveness of measures and quantify the current state of the epidemic. This paper illustrates the potential of this approach to build a new dynamic probabilistic model to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different compartments. Method(s): We propose a new probabilistic model in which, for the first time in the epidemic literature, parameter learning is carried out using gradient-free stochastic black-box optimization techniques simulating multiple trajectories of the infection dynamics in a general way, solving an inverse problem that is defined employing the daily information from mortality records. Result(s): After the application of the new proposal in Spain in the first and successive waves, the result of the model confirms the accuracy to estimate the seroprevalence and allows us to know the real dynamics of the pandemic a posteriori to assess the impact of epidemiological measures by the Spanish government and to plan more efficiently the subsequent decisions with the prior knowledge obtained. Conclusion(s):The model results allow us to estimate the daily patterns of COVID-19 infections in Spain retrospectively and examine the population's exposure to the virus dynamically in contrast to seroprevalence surveys. Furthermore, given the flexibility of our simulation framework, we can model situations -even using non-parametric distributions between the different compartments in the model- that other models in the existing literature cannot. Our general optimization strategy remains valid in these cases, and we can easily create other non-standard simulation epidemic models that incorporate more complex and dynamic structures.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {The study of regional COVID-19 daily reported cases is used to understand pattern of spread and disease progression over time. These data are challenging to model due to noise that is present, which arises from failures in reporting, false positive tests, etc., and the spatial dependence between regions. In this work, we extend a recently developed Bayesian modeling framework for inference of functional data to jointly estimate and cluster daily reported cases data from US states, while accounting for spatial dependence between US states. Shape-restriction allows us to directly infer the number of extrema of a smooth infection rate curve that underlies noisy data. Other parameters in the model account for the relative timing of extrema, and the magnitude and severity of infection rates. We incorporate mobility behavior of each US state's population into an informative prior model to account for the spatial dependence between US states. Our model corroborates past work that shows that different US states have indeed experienced COVID-19 differently, but that there are regional patterns within the US. The modeling results can be used to assess severity of infection in individual US states and trends of neighboring US states to aid pandemic planning. Retrospectively, this model can be used to see which factors (governmental, behavioral, etc.) are associated with the varying shapes of infection rate curves, which is left as future work.

   abstract = {Objectives: To describe the monthly distribution of COVID-19 hospitalisations, deaths and case-fatality rates (CFR) in Lombardy (Italy) throughout 2020. Method(s): We analysed de-identified hospitalisation data comprising all COVID-19-related admissions from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020. The overall survival (OS) from time of first hospitalisation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. We estimated monthly CFRs and performed Cox regression models to measure the effects of potential predictors on OS. Result(s): Hospitalisation and death peaks occurred in March and November 2020. Patients aged >=70 years had an up to 180 times higher risk of dying compared to younger patients [70-80: HR 58.10 (39.14-86.22); 80-90: 106.68 (71.01-160.27); >=90: 180.96 (118.80-275.64)]. Risk of death was higher in patients with one or more comorbidities [1: HR 1.27 (95% CI 1.20-1.35); 2: 1.44 (1.33-1.55); >=3: 1.73 (1.58-1.90)] and in those with specific conditions (hypertension, diabetes). Conclusion(s): Our data sheds light on the Italian pandemic scenario, uncovering mechanisms and gaps at regional health system level and, on a larger scale, adding to the body of knowledge needed to inform effective health service planning, delivery, and preparedness in times of crisis.Copyright © 2022 Mauer, Chiecca, Carioli, Gianfredi, Iacoviello, Bertagnolio, Guerra, Odone and Signorelli.},

   abstract = {In the midst of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, examining reported case data could lead to biased speculations and conclusions. Indeed, estimation of unreported infections is crucial for a better understanding of the current emergency in China and in other countries. In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to the 23 January 2020 restrictions. To do this, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42-2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%-93.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%-92.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections. Once it has been tested on Chinese data, our model could be applied to other countries with different surveillance and testing policies.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   journal = {American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM},
   volume = {5},
   number = {6},
   pages = {100947},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus have increased over the last several decades.1,2 This has resulted in a higher number of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates.3 The US cesarean delivery rate has increased over the same period; LGA fetuses may be a contributing factor.4 This study aimed to establish whether birthweights in the United States have increased over time. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted using live birth data of singleton pregnancies from the US National Vital Statistics between January 1972 and December 2020. These data are deidentified and publicly available; therefore, the study was deemed exempt from our institutional review board. Singleton births between 37 0/7 and 42 6/7 weeks of gestation were included. Multiple pregnancies and deliveries which had unknown gestational age or birthweight, were excluded. The mean birthweight by each gestational age week for the years 1972-2020 was calculated at selected years (1972, 1982, 1992, 2002, 2012, 2018, and 2020). Of note, 2018 was included to account for differences in the dataset that might be due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using R statistical software, a linear model was fit for each gestational age week. A t test was performed to determine whether the slope was statistically different from zero (indicating whether there was a trend of rising or decreasing birthweights over time). RESULT(S): A total of 19,730,588 individuals met the inclusion criteria. However, <1% of the data were excluded because of missing data. Birthweight at 39, 40, 41, and 42 weeks of gestation showed a statistically significant increase over time (Figure). There was a significant decrease in birthweight at 37 weeks of gestation. Data on Hispanic ethnicity became available in 1992. After 1992, birthweight by race or ethnicity group was examined. Each race or ethnicity group echoes the overall trends observed. However, for 39, 40, 41, and 42 weeks of gestation, the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic groups have higher increases in birthweight than the non-Hispanic White group. There were fluctuations in the overall combined mean for 37 to 42 weeks of gestation (Table). CONCLUSION(S): Although the overall mean birthweight did not increase over the study period, it increased for each gestational age week at >=39 weeks of gestation. The birthweight at 37 weeks of gestation decreased. The reason for the decrease in birthweight is unclear. Contributing factors may include changes in guidelines on the timing of delivery and method of calculation of gestational age. Increases in the rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus could be contributing to the birthweight increase from 39 weeks of gestation.1,2 There was an increase in the rate of gestational diabetes mellitus from 3% to 8% in our study population from 1992 to 2020 and an increase in mean body mass index from 26.3 to 27.5 from 2012 to 2020. The publicly available birthweight data have limitations. Data collection evolved during the study period. The estimates for gestational age have become more accurate with first-trimester dating ultrasounds. Lastly, birthweight is increasing among those born from 39 to 42 weeks of gestation. These increasing birthweights may be a factor in persistently high cesarean delivery rates despite national campaigns.5 Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks., OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe., METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of "Coronavirus" were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom., RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases., CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in the beginning stages, it is essential to explore and combine new methods of disease surveillance to assist with the preparedness of health care systems at the regional level.

   abstract = {During the unprecedented situation that all countries around the globe are facing due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has also had severe socioeconomic consequences, it is imperative to explore novel approaches to monitoring and forecasting regional outbreaks as they happen or even before they do so. To that end, in this paper, the role of Google query data in the predictability of COVID-19 in the United States at both national and state level is presented. As a preliminary investigation, Pearson and Kendall rank correlations are examined to explore the relationship between Google Trends data and COVID-19 data on cases and deaths. Next, a COVID-19 predictability analysis is performed, with the employed model being a quantile regression that is bias corrected via bootstrap simulation, i.e., a robust regression analysis that is the appropriate statistical approach to taking against the presence of outliers in the sample while also mitigating small sample estimation bias. The results indicate that there are statistically significant correlations between Google Trends and COVID-19 data, while the estimated models exhibit strong COVID-19 predictability. In line with previous work that has suggested that online real-time data are valuable in the monitoring and forecasting of epidemics and outbreaks, it is evident that such infodemiology approaches can assist public health policy makers in addressing the most crucial issues: flattening the curve, allocating health resources, and increasing the effectiveness and preparedness of their respective health care systems.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is a powerful tool for the design of management policies and a fundamental part of the arsenal currently deployed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): We present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentina's parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere. RESULT(S): Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for complete lockdown, and Mendoza's healthcare system would not collapse. CONCLUSION(S): Our model and its analysis inform that the detection and isolation of all infected individuals, without leaving aside the asymptomatic group is the key to surpass this pandemic.},

   abstract = {Background: Our purpose is to assess epidemiological agent-based models-or ABMs-of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic methodologically. The rapid spread of the outbreak requires fast-paced decision-making regarding mitigation measures. However, the evidence for the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as imposed social distancing and school or workplace closures is scarce: few observational studies use quasi-experimental research designs, and conducting randomized controlled trials seems infeasible. Additionally, evidence from the previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS lacks external validity, given the significant differences in contagiousness of those pathogens relative to SARS-CoV-2. To address the pressing policy questions that have emerged as a result of COVID-19, epidemiologists have produced numerous models that range from simple compartmental models to highly advanced agent-based models. These models have been criticized for involving simplifications and lacking empirical support for their assumptions. Method(s): To address these voices and methodologically appraise epidemiological ABMs, we consider AceMod (the model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia) as a case study of the modelling practice. Result(s): Our example shows that, although epidemiological ABMs involve simplifications of various sorts, the key characteristics of social interactions and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are represented sufficiently accurately. This is the case because these modellers treat empirical results as inputs for constructing modelling assumptions and rules that the agents follow; and they use calibration to assert the adequacy to benchmark variables. Conclusion(s): Given this, we claim that the best epidemiological ABMs are models of actual mechanisms and deliver both mechanistic and difference-making evidence. Consequently, they may also adequately describe the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of ABMs and put forward policy recommendations.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

   pages = {370-380},
   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached Kenya in March 2020 with the initial cases reported in the capital city Nairobi and in the coastal area Mombasa. As reported by the World Health Organization, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the world, killed many, collapsed economies and changed the way people live since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in the end of 2019. As at the end of December 2020, it had led to over 2.8 million confirmed cases in Africa with over 67 thousand deaths. The trend poses a huge threat to global public health. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We employed a SEIHCRD mathematical transmission model with reported Kenyan data on cases of COVID-19 to estimate how transmission varies over time. The model is concise in structure, and successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the model to assess the factors driving the infection. The model illustrates the effect of mass testing on COVID-19 as well as individual self initiated behavioral change. The results have significant impact on the management of COVID-19 and implementation of prevention policies. The results from the model analysis shows that aggressive and effective mass testing as well as individual self initiated behaviour change play a big role in getting rid of the COVID-19 epidemic otherwise the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Seasonal influenza infects between 10 and 50 million people in the United States every year. Accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) have been named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics. Multi-model ensembles make accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza, but current operational ensemble forecasts are static: they require an abundance of past ILI data and assign fixed weights to component models at the beginning of a season, but do not update weights as new data on component model performance is collected. We propose an adaptive ensemble that (i) does not initially need data to combine forecasts and (ii) finds optimal weights which are updated week-by-week throughout the influenza season. We take a regularized likelihood approach and investigate this regularizer's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance. After finding an optimal regularization value, we compare our adaptive ensemble to an equal-weighted and static ensemble. Applied to forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level, our adaptive model outperforms an equal-weighted ensemble and has similar performance to the static ensemble using only a fraction of the data available to the static ensemble. Needing no data at the beginning of an epidemic, an adaptive ensemble can quickly train and forecast an outbreak, providing a practical tool to public health officials looking for a forecast to conform to unique features of a specific season.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {From February to May 2020, experts in the modeling of infectious disease provided quantitative predictions and estimates of trends in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in a series of 13 surveys. Data on existing transmission patterns were sparse when the pandemic began, but experts synthesized information available to them to provide quantitative, judgment-based assessments of the current and future state of the pandemic. We aggregated expert predictions into a single "linear pool" by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The linear pool approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a linear pool rarely provided the most accurate prediction. This work highlights the importance that an expert linear pool could play in flexibly assessing a wide array of risks early in future emerging outbreaks, especially in settings where available data cannot yet support data-driven computational modeling.Copyright © 2022 McAndrew, Reich.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. Method(s): An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. Result(s): Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. Conclusion(s): Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be required across the winter period 2020-2021.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

   abstract = {Background: Forecast models have been essential in understanding COVID-19 transmission and guiding public health responses throughout the pandemic. This study aims to assess the effect of weather variability and Google data on COVID-19 transmission and develop multivariable time series AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for improving traditional predictive modelling for informing public health policy., Methods: COVID-19 case notifications, meteorological factors and Google data were collected over the B.1.617.2 (Delta) outbreak in Melbourne, Australia from August to November 2021. Timeseries cross-correlation (TSCC) was used to evaluate the temporal correlation between weather factors, Google search trends, Google Mobility data and COVID-19 transmission. Multivariable time series ARIMA models were fitted to forecast COVID-19 incidence and Effective Reproductive Number (R eff ) in the Greater Melbourne region. Five models were fitted to compare and validate predictive models using moving three-day ahead forecasts to test the predictive accuracy for both COVID-19 incidence and R eff over the Melbourne Delta outbreak., Results: Case-only ARIMA model resulted in an R squared (R2) value of 0.942, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 141.59, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 23.19. The model including transit station mobility (TSM) and maximum temperature (Tmax) had greater predictive accuracy with R2 0.948, RMSE 137.57, and MAPE 21.26., Conclusion: Multivariable ARIMA modelling for COVID-19 cases and R eff was useful for predicting epidemic growth, with higher predictive accuracy for models including TSM and Tmax. These results suggest that TSM and Tmax would be useful for further exploration for developing weather-informed early warning models for future COVID-19 outbreaks with potential application for the inclusion of weather and Google data with disease surveillance in developing effective early warning systems for informing public health policy and epidemic response.

   abstract = {Short-term forecasts of traditional streams from public health reporting (such as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) are a key input to public health decision-making during a pandemic. Since early 2020, our research group has worked with data partners to collect, curate, and make publicly available numerous real-time COVID-19 indicators, providing multiple views of pandemic activity in the United States. This paper studies the utility of five such indicators-derived from deidentified medical insurance claims, self-reported symptoms from online surveys, and COVID-related Google search activity-from a forecasting perspective. For each indicator, we ask whether its inclusion in an autoregressive (AR) model leads to improved predictive accuracy relative to the same model excluding it. Such an AR model, without external features, is already competitive with many top COVID-19 forecasting models in use today. Our analysis reveals that 1) inclusion of each of these five indicators improves on the overall predictive accuracy of the AR model; 2) predictive gains are in general most pronounced during times in which COVID cases are trending in "flat" or "down" directions; and 3) one indicator, based on Google searches, seems to be particularly helpful during "up" trends.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed acute care providers in demanding situations in predicting disease given the clinical variability, desire to cohort patients, and high variance in testing availability. An approach to stratifying patients by likelihood of disease based on rapidly available emergency department (ED) clinical data would offer significant operational and clinical value. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a predictive model to aid in the discrimination of patients undergoing investigation for COVID-19., METHODS: All patients greater than 18 years presenting to a single academic ED who were tested for COVID-19 during this index ED evaluation were included. Outcome was defined as the result of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during the index visit or any positive result within the following 7 days. Variables included chest radiograph interpretation, disease-specific screening questions, and laboratory data. Three models were developed with a split-sample approach to predict outcome of the PCR test utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and gradient-boosted decision tree methods. Model discrimination was evaluated comparing area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and point statistics at a predefined threshold., RESULTS: A total of 1,026 patients were included in the study collected between March and April 2020. Overall, there was disease prevalence of 9.6% in the population under study during this time frame. The logistic regression model was found to have an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84 to 0.94) when including four features: exposure history, temperature, white blood cell count (WBC), and chest radiograph result. Random forest method resulted in AUC of 0.86 (95% CI = 0.79 to 0.92) and gradient boosting had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.79 to 0.91). With a consistently held negative predictive value, the logistic regression model had a positive predictive value of 0.29 (0.2-0.39) compared to 0.2 (0.14-0.28) for random forest and 0.22 (0.15-0.3) for the gradient-boosted method., CONCLUSION: The derived predictive models offer good discriminating capacity for COVID-19 disease and provide interpretable and usable methods for those providers caring for these patients at the important crossroads of the community and the health system. We found utilization of the logistic regression model utilizing exposure history, temperature, WBC, and chest X-ray result had the greatest discriminatory capacity with the most interpretable model. Integrating a predictive model-based approach to COVID-19 testing decisions and patient care pathways and locations could add efficiency and accuracy to decrease uncertainty.

   title = {Pandemic fatigue impact on COVID-19 spread: A mathematical modelling answer to the Italian scenario},
   journal = {Results in physics},
   volume = {31},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has generated, in addition to the dramatic sanitary consequences, severe psychological repercussions for the populations affected by the pandemic. Simultaneously, these consequences can have related effects on the spread of the virus. Pandemic fatigue occurs when stress rises beyond a threshold, leading a person to feel demotivated to follow recommended behaviours to protect themselves and others. In the present paper, we introduce a new susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered-dead (SIQRD) model in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The model considers the countermeasures taken by sanitary authorities and the effect of pandemic fatigue. The latter can be mitigated by fear of the disease's consequences modelled with the death rate in mind. The mathematical well-posedness of the model is proved. We show the numerical results to be consistent with the transmission dynamics data characterising the epidemic of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy in 2020. We provide a measure of the possible pandemic fatigue impact. The model can be used to evaluate the public health interventions and prevent with specific actions the possible damages resulting from the social phenomenon of relaxation concerning the observance of the preventive rules imposed.

   title = {First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast},
   journal = {Global health research and policy},
   volume = {5},
   pages = {43},
   abstract = {Background: The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people in the world. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Method(s): We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 30 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative log-logistic distribution. Result(s): A total of 101,739 infected individuals were confirmed until 30 March 2020, of which 14,620 recovered or discharged, and 11,591 deaths. Until the same date patients quarantined at home were 43,752, whereas hospitalized patients were 31,776, of which 3981 in intensive care. The active cases (i.e. the number of patients not yet recovered until that date) were 75,528. The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 234,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic of approximately 4months. Conclusion(s): One month after the first outbreaks there seemed to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic. The pandemic due to novel Coronavirus must be a warning for all countries worldwide, regarding a rapid and complete dissemination of information, surveillance, health organization, and cooperation among the states.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.},

   abstract = {Simulating the spread of infectious diseases in human communities is critical for predicting the trajectory of an epidemic and verifying various policies to control the devastating impacts of the outbreak. Many existing simulators are based on compartment models that divide people into a few subsets and simulate the dynamics among those subsets using hypothesized differential equations. However, these models lack the requisite granularity to study the effect of intelligent policies that influence every individual in a particular way. In this work, we introduce a simulator software capable of modeling a population structure and controlling the disease's propagation at an individualistic level. In order to estimate the confidence of the conclusions drawn from the simulator, we employ a comprehensive probabilistic approach where the entire population is constructed as a hierarchical random variable. This approach makes the inferred conclusions more robust against sampling artifacts and gives confidence bounds for decisions based on the simulation results. To showcase potential applications, the simulator parameters are set based on the formal statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcome of a wide range of control measures is investigated. Furthermore, the simulator is used as the environment of a reinforcement learning problem to find the optimal policies to control the pandemic. The obtained experimental results indicate the simulator's adaptability and capacity in making sound predictions and a successful policy derivation example based on real-world data. As an exemplary application, our results show that the proposed policy discovery method can lead to control measures that produce significantly fewer infected individuals in the population and protect the health system against saturation.Copyright © 2023 Mehrjou et al.

   pages = {e19446},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to quickly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread of this virus., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop county-level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data., METHODS: We estimated county-level COVID-19 occurrences for the period March 14 to 31, 2020, based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. We developed a three-stage model using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, to quantify the probability of COVID-19 occurrence and estimate the number of potential occurrences for unaffected counties. Finally, these results were combined to predict the county-level risk. This risk was then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county., RESULTS: The model predictions showed a sensitivity over 71% and specificity over 94% for models built using data from March 14 to 31, 2020. We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged >70 years, and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We observed a positive association at the county level between urbanicity and vulnerability to COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduce significant variation in reported cases, which produces a bias in the model.

   pages = {3564-3590},
   abstract = {The use of the SEIR model of compartmentalized population dynamics with an added fomite term is analysed as a means of statistically quantifying the contribution of contaminated fomites to the spread of a viral epidemic. It is shown that for normally expected lifetimes of a virus on fomites, the dynamics of the populations are nearly indistinguishable from the case without fomites. With additional information, such as the change in social contacts following a lockdown, however, it is shown that, under the assumption that the reproduction number for direct infection is proportional to the number of social contacts, the population dynamics may be used to place meaningful statistical constraints on the role of fomites that are not affected by the lockdown. The case of the Spring 2020 UK lockdown in response to COVID-19 is presented as an illustration. An upper limit is found on the transmission rate by contaminated fomites of fewer than 1 in 30 per day per infectious person (95% CL) when social contact information is taken into account. Applied to postal deliveries and food packaging, the upper limit on the contaminated fomite transmission rate corresponds to a probability below 1 in 70 (95% CL) that a contaminated fomite transmits the infection. The method presented here may be helpful for guiding health policy over the contribution of some fomites to the spread of infection in other epidemics until more complete risk assessments based on mechanistic modelling or epidemiological investigations may be completed.},

   journal = {Health care management science},
   volume = {24},

   pages = {356-374},
   abstract = {COVID-19 has disrupted healthcare operations and resulted in large-scale cancellations of elective surgery. Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke's hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic continues to emphasize the importance of epidemiological modelling in guiding timely and systematic responses to public health threats. Nonetheless, the predictive qualities of these models remain limited by their underlying assumptions of the factors and determinants shaping national and regional disease landscapes. Here, we introduce epidemiological feature detection, a novel latent variable mixture modelling approach to extracting and parameterizing distinct and localized features of real-world trends in daily COVID-19 cases and deaths. In this approach, we combine methods of peak deconvolution that are commonly used in spectroscopy with the susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased model of disease transmission. We analyze the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, Canada, and Germany and find that the lag time between reported cases and deaths, which we term case-death latency, is closely correlated with adjusted case fatality rates across these countries. Our findings illustrate the spatiotemporal variability of both these disease metrics within and between different disease landscapes. They also highlight the complex relationship between case-death latency, adjusted case fatality rate, and COVID-19 management across various degrees of decentralized governments and administrative structures, which provides a retrospective framework for responding to future pandemics and disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 death rate in Northeast Brazil is much higher when compared to the national average, demanding a study into the prognosis of the region for planning control measures and preventing the collapse of the health care system. We estimated the potential total cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the region for the next three months. Our study included all confirmed cases, from March 8 until April 28, 2020, collected from the official website that reports the situation of COVID-19 infections in Brazil. The Boltzmann function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding different states. The model data were well fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999. Up to April 28, 20,665 cases were confirmed in the region. The state of Ceara has the highest rate of accumulated cases per 100,000 inhabitants (75.75), followed by Pernambuco. We estimated that the states of Ceara, Sergipe and Paraiba will experience a dramatic increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 31. Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piaui showed a more discreet increase in the model. For Bahia and Alagoas, a 4.7 and 6.6-fold increase in the rate was estimated, respectively. We estimate a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the region within three months, especially for Ceara, Sergipe and Paraiba. The Boltzmann function proved to be a simple tool for epidemiological forecasting that can help planning the measures to contain COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Successive generalisations of the basic SEIR model have been proposed to accommodate the different needs of the organisations handling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. These generalisations have not been able until today to represent the potential of the epidemic to overwhelm hospital capacity until today. This work builds on previous generalisations, including a new compartment for hospital occupancy that allows accounting for the infected patients that need specialised medical attention. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the hospitalisations rate and probability as well as of the recovery rates for hospitalised and non-hospitalised individuals is achieved, offering new information and predictions of crucial importance for the planning of the health systems and global epidemic response. Additionally, a new methodology to calibrate epidemic flows between compartments is proposed. We conclude that the two-step calibration procedure is able to recalibrate non-error-free data and showed crucial to reconstruct the series in a specific situation characterised by significant errors over the official recovery cases. The performed modelling also allowed us to understand how effective the several interventions (lockdown or other mobility restriction measures) were, offering insight for helping public authorities to set the timing and intensity of the measures in order to avoid the implosion of the health systems.Copyright © 2021.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been evaluated using an algorithm based on the Bateman function in a modified SIR/SIZModel. Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A-No restrictions on the population; Scenario B-Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C-Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant (alpha) for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant (beta) for the fall in number of infectious persons.Copyright © 2020 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

   abstract = {Building realistically complex models of infectious disease transmission that are relevant for informing public health is conceptually challenging and requires knowledge of coding architecture that can implement key modeling conventions. For example, many of the models built to understand COVID-19 dynamics have included stochasticity, transmission dynamics that change throughout the epidemic due to changes in host behavior or public health interventions, and spatial structures that account for important spatio-temporal heterogeneities. Here we introduce an R package, SPARSEMODr, that allows users to simulate disease models that are stochastic and spatially explicit, including a model for COVID-19 that was useful in the early phases of the epidemic. SPARSEMOD stands for SPAtial Resolution-SEnsitive Models of Outbreak Dynamics, and our goal is to demonstrate particular conventions for rapidly simulating the dynamics of more complex, spatial models of infectious disease. In this report, we outline the features and workflows of our software package that allow for user-customized simulations. We believe the example models provided in our package will be useful in educational settings, as the coding conventions are adaptable, and will help new modelers to better understand important assumptions that were built into sophisticated COVID-19 models.

In this ecological study, we identified county-level variables associated with the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) using publicly available datasets and a negative binomial generalized linear model. Variables associated with decreased CFR included a greater number of hospitals per 10,000 people, banning religious gatherings, a higher percentage of people living in mobile homes, and a higher percentage of uninsured people. Variables associated with increased CFR included a higher percentage of the population over age 65, a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, a higher asthma prevalence, and a greater number of hospitals in a county. By identifying factors that are associated with COVID-19 CFR in US counties, we hope to help officials target public health interventions and healthcare resources to locations that are at increased risk of COVID-19 fatalities.},

   abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, so too has the recognition that cases and deaths have been underreported, perhaps vastly so. Here, we present an econometric strategy to estimate the true number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for 61 and 56 countries, respectively, from 1 January 2020 to 3 November 2020. Specifically, we estimate a 'structural' model based on the SIR epidemiological model extended to incorporate underreporting. The results indicate significant underreporting by magnitudes that align with existing research and conjectures by public health experts. While our approach requires some strong assumptions, these assumptions are very different from the equally strong assumptions required by other approaches addressing underreporting in the assessment of the extent of the pandemic. Thus, we view our approach as a complement to existing methods. Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques are a suite of model fitting methods which can be implemented without a using likelihood function. In order to use ABC in a time-efficient manner users must make several design decisions including how to code the ABC algorithm and the type of ABC algorithm to use. Furthermore, ABC relies on a number of user defined choices which can greatly effect the accuracy of estimation. Having a clear understanding of these factors in reducing computation time and improving accuracy allows users to make more informed decisions when planning analyses. In this paper, we present an introduction to ABC with a focus of application to infectious disease models. We present a tutorial on coding practice for ABC in R and three case studies to illustrate the application of ABC to infectious disease models.Copyright © 2019},

   abstract = {The worldwide pandemic situation of COVID-19 generates a situation in which healthcare resources such as diagnostic kits, drugs and basic healthcare infrastructure were on shortage throughout the period, along with negative impact on socio-economic system. Standardized public healthcare models were missing in pandemic situation, covering from hospitalized patient care to local resident's healthcare managements in terms of monitoring, assess to diagnosis and medicines. This exploratory and intervention-based study with the objective of proposing COVID-19 Care Management Model representing comprehensive care of society including patients (COVID-19 and other diseases) and healthy subjects under integrated framework of healthier management model. Shifting policy towards technology-oriented models with well-aligned infrastructure can achieve better outcomes in COVID-19 prevention and care. The planned development of technical healthcare models for prognosis and improved treatment outcomes that take into account not only genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, materials science perspectives but also the possible contribution of advanced digital technologies is best strategies for early diagnosis and infections control. In view of current pandemic, a Healthier Healthcare Management Model is proposed here as a source of standardized care having technology support, medical consultation, along with public health model of sanitization, distancing and contact less behaviours practices. Effective healthcare managements have been the main driver of healthier society where, positive action at identified research, technology and management segment more specifically public health, patient health, technology selection and political influence has great potential to enhanced the global response to COVID-19. The implementation of such practices will deliver effective diagnosis and control mechanism and make healthier society.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {Mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 comes with the evaluation of tradeoffs. However, the exact magnitude of the tradeoffs being made cannot be known ahead of time. There are three major concerns to balance: life, liberty, and economy. Here, we create a multi-attribute utility function including those three attributes and provide reasonable bounds on the weights of each. No one set of weights on the utility function can be considered "correct." Furthermore, the outcomes of each mitigation strategy are deeply uncertain. Not only do we need to take into account the characteristics of the disease, but we also need to take into account the efficacy of the mitigation strategies and how each outcome would be evaluated. To handle this, we use Robust Decision Making methods to simulate plausible outcomes for various strategies and evaluate those outcomes using different weights on the multi-attribute utility function. The simulation is done with a compartmental epidemiological model combined with a simple economic model and a model of liberty costs. Rather than trying to optimize likely outcomes for a particular version of the utility function, we find which strategies are robust across a wide range of plausible scenarios even when there is disagreement about how to weigh the competing values of life, liberty, and economy.

   abstract = {There are many cases within epidemiology where infections compete to persist within a population. In studying models for such cases, one of the goals is to determine which infections can invade a population and persist when other infections are already resident within the population. Invasion reproductive numbers (IRN), which are tied to the stability of boundary endemic equilibria, can address this question. By reinterpreting resident infections epidemiologically, this study extends methods for finding IRNs to periodic systems, and presents some examples which illustrate the often complex computations required. Results identify conditions under which a simple time-average can be used to derive IRNs, and apply the methods to examine how seasonal fluctuations in influenza incidence facilitate the year-round persistence of bacterial respiratory infections.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

During the early coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic period in January-February 2020, limited information was available, and it was too challenging to build detailed mechanistic models reflecting population behavior. This study compared the performance of phenomenological and mechanistic models for forecasting epidemics. For the former, we employed the Richards model and the approximate solution of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. For the latter, we examined the exponential growth (with lockdown) model and SIR model with lockdown. The phenomenological models yielded higher root mean square error (RMSE) values than the mechanistic models. When using the numbers from reported data for February 1 and 5, the Richards model had the highest RMSE, whereas when using the February 9 data, the SIR approximation model was the highest. The exponential model with a lockdown effect had the lowest RMSE, except when using the February 9 data. Once interventions or other factors that influence transmission patterns are identified, they should be additionally taken into account to improve forecasting.},

   abstract = {Passenger contact in public transit (PT) networks can be a key mediate in the spreading of infectious diseases. This paper proposes a time-varying weighted PT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the PT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also considered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We find that people's preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading of epidemics. Identifying "influential passengers" using the smart card data and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic spreading. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R0. Without self-isolation, when R0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.Copyright © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Coronavirus was flown in -December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei region in China. Currently, the situation is enlarged by the infection in more than 200 countries all over the world. In this situation it was rising into huge forms in Bangladesh too. Modulated with a public dataset delivered by the IEDCR health authority, we have produced a sustainable prognostic method of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh using a deep learning model. Throughout the research, we forecasted up to 30 days in which per day actual prediction was confirmed, death and recoveries number of people. Furthermore, we illustrated that long short-term memory (LSTM) demands the actual output trends among time series data analysis with a controversial study that exceeds random forest (RF) regression and support vector regression (SVR), which both are machine learning (ML) models. The current COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh has been considered in this paper. Here, a well-known recurrent neural network (RNN) model in order to referred by the LSTM network that has forecasted COVID-19 cases on per day infected scenario of Bangladesh from May 15th of 2020 till June 15th of 2020. Added with a comparative study that drives into the LSTM, SVR, RF regression which is processed by the RMSE transmission rate. In all respects, in Bangladesh the gravity of COVID-19 has become excessive nowadays so that depending on this situation public health sectors and common people need to be aware of this situation and also be able to get knowledge of how long self-lockdown will be maintained. So far, to the best of our knowledge LSTM based time series analysis forecasting infectious diseases is a well-done formula. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Background: This research aimed to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in Malaysia and develop a GUI-based model. Design and methods: The model is an improvement of the susceptible, infected, recovery, and death (SIRD) compartmental model. The epidemiological parameters of the infection, recovery, and death rates were formulated as time dependent piecewise functions by incorporating the control measures of lockdown, social distancing, quarantine, lockdown lifting time and the percentage of people who abide by the rules. An improved SIRD model was solved via the 4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method and 14 unknown parameters were estimated by using NelderMead algorithm and pattern-search technique. The publicly available data for COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia was used to validate the performance of the model. The GUI-based SIRD model was developed to simulate the number of active cases of COVID- 19 over time by considering movement control order (MCO) lifted date and the percentage of people who abide the rules. Result(s): The simulator showed that the improved SIRD model adequately fitted Malaysia COVID-19 data indicated by low values of root mean square error (RMSE) as compared to other existing models. The higher the percentage of people following the SOP, the lower the spread of disease. Another key point is that the later the lifting time after the lockdown, the lower the spread of disease. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of the society to obey the intervention measures in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 disease.Copyright © the Author(s), 2021.},

   abstract = {Italy was the first European country affected by the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, with the first autochthonous case identified on Feb 21st. Specific control measures restricting social contacts were introduced by the Italian government starting from the beginning of March. In the current study we analyzed public data from the four most affected Italian regions. We (i) estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt ), the average number of secondary cases that each infected individual would infect at time t, to monitor the positive impact of restriction measures; (ii) applied the generalized logistic and the modified Richards models to describe the epidemic pattern and obtain short-term forecasts. We observed a monotonic decrease of Rt over time in all regions, and the peak of incident cases ~2 weeks after the implementation of the first strict containment measures. Our results show that phenomenological approaches may be useful to monitor the epidemic growth in its initial phases and suggest that costly and disruptive public health controls might have had a positive impact in limiting the Sars-Cov-2 spread in Northern Italy.

   journal = {Scientific reports},
   volume = {11},
   number = {1},
   pages = {12426},
   abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a multi-method modeling approach to community-level spreading of COVID-19 disease. Our methodology was composed of interconnected age-stratified system dynamics models in an agent-based modeling framework that allowed for a granular examination of the scale and severity of disease spread, including metrics such as infection cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU usage. Model parameters were calibrated using an optimization technique with an objective function to minimize error associated with the cumulative cases of COVID-19 during a training period between March 15 and October 31, 2020. We outlined several case studies to demonstrate the model's state- and local-level projection capabilities. We further demonstrated how model outcomes could be used to evaluate perceived levels of COVID-19 risk across different localities using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework. The model's two, three, and four week out-of-sample projection errors varied on a state-by-state basis, and generally increased as the out-of-sample projection period was extended. Additionally, the prediction error in the state-level projections was generally due to an underestimation of cases and an overestimation of deaths. The proposed modeling approach can be used as a virtual laboratory to investigate a wide range of what-if scenarios and easily adapted to future high-consequence public health threats.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes pose a threat to the European Region. Emerging arboviroses (such as Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus) have acquired significant relevance in recent years. The favourable climatologically conditions, the presence of the transmitting vectors and the numerous international trips, make the Mediterranean a zone of high risk for the introduction of these diseases. Such theoretical framework has been overcome for the recent arboviroses outbreaks in the southern countries of Europe. Centralized surveillance systems and public health agencies with limited resources may not be sufficiently operational to provide an adequate response to a new threat of such type. Aim(s): We pretend to give an overview of the current epidemiological scenario in our region and to present at premiere an innovative initiative based on an integrated management platform for epidemiological surveillance with advanced applications of predictive models and citizen participation which will help to control these epidemics. The "PICAT" platform aims to integrate all the relevant information that can determine the emergence of autochthonous cases in our territory and create a network with the main agents involved (primary care, specialized centres, advanced research centres, public health agencies and civil society). By developing an innovative geo-localized data management system, they will help predict the potential risk of epidemics and the dynamics of infections, helping to optimize epidemiological control interventions.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has spread successfully worldwide in a matter of weeks. After the example of China, all the affected countries are taking hard-confinement measures to control the infection and to gain some time to reduce the significant amount of cases that arrive at the hospital. Although the measures in China reduced the percentages of new cases, this is not seen in other countries that have taken similar measures, such as Italy and Spain. After the first weeks, the worry was whether or not the healthcare system would collapse rather than its response to the patient's needs who are infected and require hospitalization. Using China as a mirror of what could happen in our countries and with the data available, we calculated a model that forecasts the peak of the curve of infection, hospitalization, and ICU bed numbers. We aimed to review the patterns of spread of the virus in the two countries and their regions, looking for similarities that reflect the existence of a typical path in this expansive virulence and the effects of the intervention of the authorities with drastic isolation measures, to contain the outbreak. A model based on Autorregressive and moving average models (ARMA) methodology and including Chinese disease pattern as a proxy, predicts the contagious pattern robustly. Based on the prediction, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were also calculated. Results suggest a reduction in the speed of contagion during April in both countries, earlier in Spain than in Italy. The forecast advanced a significant increase in the ICU needs for Spain surpassing 8,000 units by the end of April, but for Italy, ICU needs would decrease in the same period, according to the model. We present the following predictions to inform political leaders because they have the responsibility to maintain the national health systems away from collapsing. We are confident these data could help them into decision-taking and place the capitals (from hospital beds to human resources) into the right place.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To propose a health care model that integrates point-of-care technologies and artificial intelligence for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: A theoretical model was used in which one million people accessed the mobile application CoronApp-Colombia, which collects personal data, signs, symptoms and epidemiological links compatible with COVID-19. With the information from the app artificial intelligence techniques (data science) were applied in a virtual situation room., RESULTS: Users compatible with COVID-19 were prioritized and subjected to a rapid diagnostic test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Screening with the rapid diagnostic test would allow detection of sero-reactive individuals, for whom diagnostic confirmation would be carried out using molecular biology (PCR). Information from positive cases confirmed by PCR would be re-screened using artificial intelligence and spatial statistical techniques to identify geographical foci of infection. These foci could be actively searched for contacts with positive index cases and the diagnostic route would be followed again using the rapid diagnostic test and PCR., CONCLUSION: This model may be useful for countries in the region with weak or absent technological platforms for PCR diagnosis to maximize existing resources, estimate the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 (infection, morbidity, mortality and lethality) and implement containment, mitigation and control plans according to their needs.},

   volume = {11},

   abstract = {Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at a large scale to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. While recent studies show that non-pharmaceutical intervention measures such as lockdowns may have mitigated the spread of COVID-19, those measures also lead to substantial economic and social costs, and might limit exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicates the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. This observational study empirically outlines the protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by the ultraviolet index (UVI). Specifically, we examine whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role of UVB exposure. We use a log-linear fixed-effects model on a panel dataset of secondary data of 155 countries from 22 January 2020 until 7 October 2020 (n = 29,327). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with - 0.85 percentage points (p.p) and - 4.7 p.p decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. The change of UVI over time is typically large (e.g., on average, UVI in New York City increases up to 6 units between January until June), indicating that the protective role of UVI might be substantial. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (governmental recommendation to not leave the house) is associated with the mitigation of the protective role of UVI by 81% (0.76 p.p), which indicates a downside risk associated with its widespread use. We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find evidence that an increase in lockdown severity is associated with significant mitigation in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have even reduced the number of COVID-19 deaths more strongly than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 11% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure during the period people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns, and could inspire further clinical studies that may support policy decision-making in countries imposing such measures.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) which is responsible for the COVID-19 infection quickly became a global public health emergency due to its profound virulence and infectivity [1]. As of March 17, 2020, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine published recommendations with the intent to minimize virus transmission [2]. While many of these initial restrictions have been tempered, there is still much to learn about the COVID- 19 infection which likely impacts the utilization of fertility treatment. Vaughan et al found the stress of infertility to be significant and comparable to the pandemic itself [3]. To this end, it is important to examine the factors associated with greater perceived stress particularly among those with infertility during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study is to determine factors associated with greater perceived stress among infertile women during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pandemic Related Infertility Stress Scale was adapted from the Pandemic Related Pregnancy Stress Scale, a new instrument to assess multidimensional COVID-19 pandemic prenatal stress, to be administered in an infertile population [4]. This cross-sectional survey was administered to women who received care at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health between January 2019 and May 2020. Of the 441 respondents, women who were seeking treatment for a diagnosis of infertility (n=206) were asked to complete this questionnaire. Predictors of pandemic related stress investigated included income, employment status, and whether they were undergoing active treatment that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT(S): Of those seeking fertility treatment due to a diagnosis of infertility, most self-reported age between 35 and 40 years of age (46.5%), being married (76.6%), and White race/ethnicity (54.3%). In the univariate analysis, predictors of increased perceived stress of infertility included reported income less than $100,000 (p=0.0384) and working full or part-time (p=0.0244). Interestingly, infertile women who were expecting to undergo fertility treatment in March/April 2020 reported lower pandemic related stress. In the multivariate model, income less than $100,000 remained a significant predictor of increased stress among infertile women (aOR: 2.551, 95% CI: 1.073-6.065). CONCLUSION(S): As a well-established source of stress, individual morbidity of infertility is comparable to somatic diseases such as cancer and heart disease and has been deemed comparable to the stress related to the pandemic itself [3, 5]. This study revealed decreased income has a positive correlation with infertility related stress. As income has also been shown to be associated with decreased access to fertility care and severity of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not surprising that infertile women with lower reported income, disproportionately reported greater stress as compared to their counterparts [6]. This study underscores the importance of evaluating the psychological impact of this pandemic on women with infertility, particularly through this novel instrument. Furthermore, identification of income as a predictor of increased pandemic related stress should guide efforts among infertile women with additional barriers.},

   abstract = {Influenza affects millions of people every year. It causes a considerable amount of medical visits and hospitalisations as well as hundreds of thousands of deaths. Forecasting influenza prevalence with good accuracy can significantly help public health agencies to timely react to seasonal or novel strain epidemics. Although significant progress has been made, influenza forecasting remains a challenging modelling task. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework that improves over the state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy of influenza-like illness (ILI) rates in the United States. We achieve this by using Web search activity time series in conjunction with historical ILI rates as observations for training neural network (NN) architectures. The proposed models incorporate Bayesian layers to produce associated uncertainty intervals to their forecast estimates, positioning themselves as legitimate complementary solutions to more conventional approaches. The best performing NN, referred to as the iterative recurrent neural network (IRNN) architecture, reduces mean absolute error by 10.3% and improves skill by 17.1% on average in nowcasting and forecasting tasks across 4 consecutive flu seasons.Copyright: © 2023 Morris et al.

   abstract = {The emergence of many strains of the coronavirus, including the latest omicron strain, which is spreading at a very high speed, is leading to the World Health Organization's (WHO) concern about the creation of this new mutation. Therefore, there is a strong motivation for modeling and predicting COVID-19 to control the number of cases of the disease. The proposed system for predicting the number of cases of COVID-19 can help governments take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. In this paper, a statistical logistic growth model was employed to predict the spread of COVID-19 in Australia and Brazil. The datasets were collected from the surveillance systems in Australia and Brazil from March 13, 2020, to December 12, 2021, for 641 days. This proposed method used a tested logistic growth model for the complex spread of COVID-19 and forecasted future values within a time interval of six days. The results of the predicted, cumulative, confirmed cases indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed system, which was categorized by time-dependent dynamics. The coefficient of determination (R) metric was used to evaluate the model to predict COVID-19, and the proposed system scored the highest correlation (R2=99%). The proposed system has the potential to contribute to public health by making decisions about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 Sami A. Morsi and Mohammad Eid Alzahrani.},

   abstract = {Background: Healthcare workers are a key occupational group at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). We investigated the prevalence and correlates of STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak (March-July 2020). Method(s): Data come from the baseline assessment of a cohort of Spanish hospital workers (n = 5450), recruited from 10 hospitals just after the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (May 5-July 23, 2020). Web-based self-report surveys assessed 30-day STB, individual characteristics, and potentially modifiable contextual factors related to hospital workers' work and financial situation. Result(s): Thirty-day STB prevalence was estimated at 8.4% (4.9% passive ideation only, 3.5% active ideation with or without a plan or attempt). A total of n = 6 professionals attempted suicide in the past 30 days. In adjusted models, 30-day STB remained significantly associated with pre-pandemic lifetime mood (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92) and anxiety disorder (OR = 1.90). Significant modifiable factors included a perceived lack of coordination, communication, personnel, or supervision at work (population-attributable risk proportion [PARP] = 50.5%), and financial stress (PARP = 44.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: Thirty-day STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak was high. Hospital preparedness for virus outbreaks should be increased, and strong governmental policy response is needed to increase financial security among hospital workers.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

   abstract = {As of January 2021, Australia had effectively controlled local transmission of COVID-19 despite a steady influx of imported cases and several local, but contained, outbreaks in 2020. Throughout 2020, state and territory public health responses were informed by weekly situational reports that included an ensemble forecast of daily COVID-19 cases for each jurisdiction. We present here an analysis of one forecasting model included in this ensemble across the variety of scenarios experienced by each jurisdiction from May to October 2020. We examine how successfully the forecasts characterised future case incidence, subject to variations in data timeliness and completeness, showcase how we adapted these forecasts to support decisions of public health priority in rapidly-evolving situations, evaluate the impact of key model features on forecast skill, and demonstrate how to assess forecast skill in real-time before the ground truth is known. Conditioning the model on the most recent, but incomplete, data improved the forecast skill, emphasising the importance of developing strong quantitative models of surveillance system characteristics, such as ascertainment delay distributions. Forecast skill was highest when there were at least 10 reported cases per day, the circumstances in which authorities were most in need of forecasts to aid in planning and response.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {The ability of health systems to cope with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is of major concern. In preparation, we used clinical pathway models to estimate healthcare requirements for COVID-19 patients in the context of broader public health measures in Australia. An age- and risk-stratified transmission model of COVID-19 demonstrated that an unmitigated epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the health system of Australia over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone are insufficient to constrain healthcare needs within feasible levels of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions must be applied over the course of the epidemic to ensure systems do not become overwhelmed and essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed, along with ongoing strengthening of capacity.Copyright © 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In this paper, three stochastic mathematical models are developed for the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These models take into account the known special characteristics of this disease such as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different social and infectiousness conditions of infected people. In particular, they include a novel approach that considers the social structure, the fraction of detected cases over the real total infected cases, the influx of undetected infected people from outside the borders, as well as contact-tracing and quarantine period for travellers. Two of these models are discrete time-discrete state space models (one is simplified and the other is complete) while the third one is a continuous time-continuous state space stochastic integro-differential model obtained by a formal passing to the limit from the proposed simplified discrete model. From a numerical point of view, the particular case of Lebanon has been studied and its reported data have been used to estimate the complete discrete model parameters, which can be of interest in estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. The obtained simulation results have shown a good agreement with the reported data. Moreover, a parameters' analysis is presented in order to better understand the role of some of the parameters. This may help policy makers in deciding on different social distancing measures.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Viral and infectious diseases such as COVID-19 continue to pose a significant public health threat. In order to create an early warning system for new pandemics or emerging versions of the virus, it is imperative to study its epidemiology. In this study, we created a geospatial model to predict the weekly contagion and lethality rates of COVID-19 in Ireland. METHOD(S): More than forty parameters including atmospheric pollutants, metrological variables, sociodemographic factors, and lockdown phases were introduced as input variables to the model. The significant parameters in predicting the number of new cases and the death toll were identified. QGIS software was employed to process input data, and a principal component regression (PCR) model was developed using the statistical add-on XLSTAT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): The developed models were able to predict more than half of the variations in contagion and lethality rates. This indicates that the proposed model can serve to help prediction systems for the identification of future high-risk conditions. Nevertheless, there are additional parameters that could be included in future models, such as the number of deaths in care homes, the percentage of contagion and mortality among health workers, and the degree of compliance with social distancing.Copyright © 2023 Sociedad Espanola de Medicos de Atencion Primaria (SEMERGEN).

   title = {Estimating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 deaths using a Markov switching-volatility model combined with heavy-tailed distributions for South Africa},
   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {22},
   number = {1},
   pages = {1873},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus) infection exposed the unpreparedness of African countries to health-related issues, South Africa included. Africa recorded more than 211 853 deaths as a consequence of Covid-19. When rare and deadly diseases require urgent hospitalisation strikes, governments and healthcare providers are usually caught unprepared, resulting in huge loss of lives. Usually, at the beginning of such pandemics, there is no rich data for health practitioners and academics to be able to forecast the number of patients or deaths related to the pandemic. This study aims to predict the number of deaths associated with Covid-19 infection. With the availability of the number of deaths on a daily basis, the results stemming from this study are important to inform and plan health policy. METHOD(S): This study uses the daily number of deaths due to Covid-19 infection. Exploratory data analysis reveals that the data exhibits non-normality, three structural breaks and volatility clustering characteristics. The Markov switching (MS)-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type model combined with heavy-tailed distributions is fitted to the returns of the data. Using available daily reported Covid-19-related deaths up until 26 August 2021, we report 10-day ahead forecasts of deaths. All forecasts are compared to the actual observed values in the forecasting period. RESULT(S): The Anderson-Darling Goodness of fit test confirms that the fitted models are adequate for the data. The Kupiec likelihood ratio test and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used to select the robust model at different risk levels. At 95% the MS(3)-GARCH(1,1) combined with Pearson's type IV distribution (PIVD) is the best model. This indicates that the proposed best-fitting model is reasonable and can be used for predicting the daily number of deaths due to Covid-19. CONCLUSION(S): The MS(3)-GARCH(1,1)-PIVD model provides a reliable and accurate method for predicting the minimum number of death due to Covid-19. The accuracy of the proposed model will assist policymakers, academics and health practitioners in forecasting the volatility of future health-related deaths in which the predictability of volatility plays an integral role in health risk management.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {The ascendancy of coronavirus has become widespread all around the world. For the prevention of viral transmission, the pattern of disease is explored. Epidemiological modeling is a vital component of the research. These models assist in studying various aspects of infectious diseases, such as death, recovery, and infection rates. Coronavirus trends across several countries may analyze sufficiently using SIR, SEIR, and SIQR models. Across this study, we propose two modified versions of the SEIRD method for evaluating the transmission of this infectious disease in the South Asian countries, more precisely, in the south Asian subcontinent. The SEIRD model is updated further by fusing some new factors, namely, isolation for the suspected people and recovery and death of the people who are not under the coverage of healthcare schemes or reluctant to receive treatment for various catastrophes. We will investigate the influences of those ingredients on public health-related issues. Finally, we will predict and display the infection scenario and relevant elements with the concluding remarks through the statistical analysis.Copyright © 2021 Shafayat Bin Shabbir Mugdha et al.},

   abstract = {Background: COVID-19 pandemic has indeed plunged the global community especially African countries into an alarming difficult situation culminating into a great deal amounts of catastrophes such as economic recession, political instability and loss of jobs. The pandemic spreads exponentially and causes loss of lives. Following the outbreak of the omicron new variant of concern, forecasting and identification of the COVID-19 infection cases is very vital for government at various levels. Hence, having knowledge of the spread at a particular point in time, swift actions can be taken by government at various levels with a view to accordingly formulate new policies and modalities towards minimizing the trajectory of the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic to both public health and economic sectors. Method(s): Here, a potent combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learning algorithm along with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) learning algorithm has been proposed in this work in order to produce a hybrid of a deep learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) for forecasting COVID-19 infection cases particularly in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana. Forecasting models for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana, were developed for 10 days using deep learning-based approaches namely CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM deep learning algorithm respectively. Result(s): The models were evaluated on the basis of four standard performance evaluation metrics which include accuracy, MSE, MAE and RMSE respectively. However, the CNN-LSTM deep learning-based forecasting model achieved the best accuracy of 98.30%, 97.60%, and 97.74% for Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana respectively; and in the same manner, achieved lesser MSE, MAE and RMSE values compared to models developed with CNN and LSTM respectively. Conclusion(s): Taken together, the CNN-LSTM deep learning-based forecasting model for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana dramatically surpasses the two other DL based forecasting models (CNN and LSTM) for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana in terms of not only the best accuracy of with 98.30%, 97.60%, and 97.74% but also in terms of lesser MSE, MAE and RMSE.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM).},

   abstract = {The U.S. with only 4% of the world's population, bears a disproportionate share of infections in the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S. conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one, the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our methodology can be applied to other countries and has the potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as well. With this first step in attempting to quantify the factors that go into the "black box"of the transmission factor beta, we hope that our work will stimulate further research in the dual role of mitigation policies and compliance.Copyright © 2021 Mukerjee et al.

   volume = {2023},
   pages = {8921220},
   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc globally, resulting in millions of cases and deaths. The objective of this study was to predict mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Zambia using machine learning (ML) methods based on factors that have been shown to be predictive of mortality and thereby improve pandemic preparedness. This research employed seven powerful ML models that included decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), gradient boosting (GB), and XGBoost (XGB). These classifiers were trained on 1,433 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from various health facilities in Zambia. The performances achieved by these models were checked using accuracy, recall, F1-Score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC_AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PRC_AUC), and other metrics. The best-performing model was the XGB which had an accuracy of 92.3%, recall of 94.2%, F1-Score of 92.4%, and ROC_AUC of 97.5%. The pairwise Mann-Whitney U-test analysis showed that the second-best model (GB) and the third-best model (RF) did not perform significantly worse than the best model (XGB) and had the following: GB had an accuracy of 91.7%, recall of 94.2%, F1-Score of 91.9%, and ROC_AUC of 97.1%. RF had an accuracy of 90.8%, recall of 93.6%, F1-Score of 91.0%, and ROC_AUC of 96.8%. Other models showed similar results for the same metrics checked. The study successfully derived and validated the selected ML models and predicted mortality effectively with reasonably high performance in the stated metrics. The feature importance analysis found that knowledge of underlying health conditions about patients' hospital length of stay (LOS), white blood cell count, age, and other factors can help healthcare providers offer lifesaving services on time, improve pandemic preparedness, and decongest health facilities in Zambia and other countries with similar settings.Copyright © 2023 Clyde Mulenga et al.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines a well-established approach from transportation modelling that uses person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of different room sizes, air exchange rates, disease import, changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), masks, indoors vs. outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. It is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. It predicts the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, masks, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall, and is thus able to quantitatively predict the consequences of interventions. It is shown that these effects are best given as additive changes of the reproduction number R. The model also explains why contact reductions have decreasing marginal returns, i.e. the first 50% of contact reductions have considerably more effect than the second 50%. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, or consequences of wearing masks in certain situations. The results can be used to inform political decisions.Copyright © 2021 Muller et al.

   abstract = {Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, are responsible for more than 50 million infections worldwide every year, with an overall increase of 30-fold in the last 50 years, mainly due to city population growth, more frequent travels and ecological changes. In the United States of America, the vast majority of Aedes-borne infections are imported from endemic regions by travelers, who can become new sources of mosquito infection upon their return home if the exposed population is susceptible to the disease, and if suitable environmental conditions for the mosquitoes and the virus are present. Since the susceptibility of the human population can be determined via periodic monitoring campaigns, the environmental suitability for the presence of mosquitoes and viruses becomes one of the most important pieces of information for decision makers in the health sector. We present a next-generation monitoring and forecasting system for [Formula: see text]-borne diseases' environmental suitability (AeDES) of transmission in the conterminous United States and transboundary regions, using calibrated ento-epidemiological models, climate models and temperature observations. After analyzing the seasonal predictive skill of AeDES, we briefly consider the recent Zika epidemic, and the compound effects of the current Central American dengue outbreak happening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to illustrate how a combination of tailored deterministic and probabilistic forecasts can inform key prevention and control strategies .},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has caused millions of infections and deaths over the last 2 years. Machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to conventional epidemiologic models in an effort to optimize short- and medium-term forecasts that will help health authorities to optimize the use of policies and resources to tackle the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although previous machine learning models based on time pattern analysis for COVID-19 sensed data have shown promising results, the spread of the virus has both spatial and temporal components. This manuscript proposes a new deep learning model that combines a time pattern extraction based on the use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) over a preceding spatial analysis based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to a sequence of COVID-19 incidence images. The model has been validated with data from the 286 health primary care centers in the Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid region, Spain). The results show improved scores in terms of both root mean square error (RMSE) and explained variance (EV) when compared with previous models that have mainly focused on the temporal patterns and dependencies.},

   abstract = {Capacity planning of ICUs is essential for effective management of health safety, quality of patient care, and the allocation of ICU resources. Whereas ICU length of stay (LOS) may be estimated using patient information such as severity of illness scoring systems, ICU census is impacted by both patient LOS and arrival patterns. We set out to develop and evaluate an ICU census forecasting algorithm using the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) and the Nine Equivalents of Nursing Manpower Use Score (NEMS) for capacity planning purposes., DESIGN: Retrospective observational study., SETTING: We developed the algorithm using data from the Medical-Surgical ICU (MSICU) at University Hospital, London, Canada and validated using data from the Critical Care Trauma Centre (CCTC) at Victoria Hospital, London, Canada., PATIENTS: Adult patient admissions (7,434) to the MSICU and (9,075) to the CCTC from 2015 to 2021., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed an Autoregressive integrated moving average time series model that forecasts patients arriving in the ICU and a survival model using MODS, NEMS, and other factors to estimate patient LOS. The models were combined to create an algorithm that forecasts ICU census for planning horizons ranging from 1 to 7 days. We evaluated the algorithm quality using several fit metrics. The root mean squared error ranged from 2.055 to 2.890 beds/d and the mean absolute percentage error from 9.4% to 13.2%. We show that this forecasting algorithm provides a better fit when compared with a moving average or a time series model that directly forecasts ICU census. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the algorithm using data during the global COVID-19 pandemic and found that the error of the forecasts increased proportionally with the number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU., CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to develop accurate tools to forecast ICU census. This type of algorithm may be important to clinicians and managers when planning ICU capacity as well as staffing and surgical demand planning over a short time horizon. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a huge strain on the health care system globally. The metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, was one of the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Risk prediction models developed by combining administrative databases and basic clinical data are needed to stratify individual patient risk for public health purposes. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to develop a stratification tool aimed at improving COVID-19 patient management and health care organization. METHOD(S): A predictive algorithm was developed and applied to 36,834 patients with COVID-19 in Italy between March 8 and the October 9, 2020, in order to foresee their risk of hospitalization. Exposures considered were age, sex, comorbidities, and symptoms associated with COVID-19 (eg, vomiting, cough, fever, diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, headache, anosmia, ageusia, and dyspnea). The outcome was hospitalizations and emergency department admissions for COVID-19. Discrimination and calibration of the model were also assessed. RESULT(S): The predictive model showed a good fit for predicting COVID-19 hospitalization (C-index 0.79) and a good overall prediction accuracy (Brier score 0.14). The model was well calibrated (intercept -0.0028, slope 0.9970). Based on these results, 118,804 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from October 25 to December 11, 2020, were stratified into low, medium, and high risk for COVID-19 severity. Among the overall study population, 67,030 (56.42%) were classified as low-risk patients; 43,886 (36.94%), as medium-risk patients; and 7888 (6.64%), as high-risk patients. In all, 89.37% (106,179/118,804) of the overall study population was being assisted at home, 9% (10,695/118,804) was hospitalized, and 1.62% (1930/118,804) died. Among those assisted at home, most people (63,983/106,179, 60.26%) were classified as low risk, whereas only 3.63% (3858/106,179) were classified at high risk. According to ordinal logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) of being hospitalized or dead was 5.0 (95% CI 4.6-5.4) among high-risk patients and 2.7 (95% CI 2.6-2.9) among medium-risk patients, as compared to low-risk patients. CONCLUSION(S): A simple monitoring system, based on primary care data sets linked to COVID-19 testing results, hospital admissions data, and death records may assist in the proper planning and allocation of patients and resources during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright ©Rossella Murtas, Nuccia Morici, Chiara Cogliati, Massimo Puoti, Barbara Omazzi, Walter Bergamaschi, Antonio Voza, Patrizia Rovere Querini, Giulio Stefanini, Maria Grazia Manfredi, Maria Teresa Zocchi, Andrea Mangiagalli, Carla Vittoria Brambilla, Marco Bosio, Matteo Corradin, Francesca Cortellaro, Marco Trivelli, Stefano Savonitto, Antonio Giampiero Russo.

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a novel virus that emerged in China in late 2019 and caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The epidemic has largely been controlled in China since March 2020, but continues to inflict severe public health and socioeconomic burden in other parts of the world. One of the major reasons for China's success for the fight against the epidemic is the effectiveness of its health care system and enlightenment (awareness) programs which play a vital role in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nigeria is currently witnessing a rapid increase of the epidemic likely due to its unsatisfactory health care system and inadequate awareness programs. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Our model incorporates awareness programs and different hospitalization strategies for mild and severe cases, to assess the effect of public awareness on the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. We fit the model to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria from 29 March to 12 June 2020. We find that the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly adopted. We presumed that the effect of awareness programs could be estimated. Further, our results suggest that the awareness programs and timely hospitalization of active cases are essential tools for effective control and mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and beyond. Finally, we perform sensitive analysis to point out the key parameters that should be considered to effectively control the epidemic.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Reinfection and reactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have recently raised public health pressing concerns in the fight against the current pandemic globally. In this study, we propose a new dynamic model to study the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The model incorporates possible relapse, reinfection and environmental contribution to assess the combined effects on the overall transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The model's local asymptotic stability is analyzed qualitatively. We derive the formula for the basic reproduction number ( R0 ) and final size epidemic relation, which are vital epidemiological quantities that are used to reveal disease transmission status and guide control strategies. Furthermore, the model is validated using the COVID-19 reported situations in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is examined by implementing a partial rank correlation coefficient technique to obtain the ultimate rank model parameters to control or mitigate the pandemic effectively. Finally, we employ a standard Euler technique for numerical simulations of the model to elucidate the influence of some crucial parameters on the overall transmission dynamics. Our results highlight that contact rate, hospitalization rate, and reactivation rate are the fundamental parameters that need particular emphasis for the prevention, mitigation and control.

   abstract = {Background: Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Africa was detected on February 14, 2020, the cumulative confirmations reached 15 207 including 831 deaths by April 13, 2020. Africa has been described as one of the most vulnerable region with the COVID-19 infection during the initial phase of the outbreak, due to the fact that Africa is a great commercial partner of China and some other EU and American countries. Which result in large volume of travels by traders to the region more frequently and causing African countries face even bigger health threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the fact that the control and management of COVID-19 pandemic rely heavily on a country's health care system, and on average Africa has poor health care system which make it more vulnerable indicating a need for timely intervention to curtail the spread. In this paper, we estimate the exponential growth rate and basic reproduction number (R 0) of COVID-19 in Africa to show the potential of the virus to spread, and reveal the importance of sustaining stringent health measures to control the disease in Africa. Method(s): We analyzed the initial phase of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Africa between 1 March and 13 April 2020, by using the simple exponential growth model. We examined the publicly available materials published by the WHO situation report to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread without sustaining strict health measures. The Poisson likelihood framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. We modelled the distribution of COVID-19 generation interval (GI) as Gamma distributions with a mean of 4.7 days and standard deviation of 2.9 days estimated from previous work, and compute the basic reproduction number. Result(s): We estimated the exponential growth rate as 0.22 per day (95% CI: 0.20-0.24), and the basic reproduction number, R 0, as 2.37 (95% CI: 2.22-2.51) based on the assumption that the exponential growth starting from 1 March 2020. With an R 0 at 2.37, we quantified the instantaneous transmissibility of the outbreak by the time-varying effective reproductive number to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread across African region. Conclusion(s): The initial growth of COVID-19 cases in Africa was rapid and showed large variations across countries. Our estimates should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Mathematical models proffer a rational basis to epidemiologists and policy makers on how, where and when to control an infectious disease. Through mathematical models one can explore and provide solutions to phenomena which are difficult to measure in the field. In this paper, a mathematical model has been used to explore the role of government and individuals reaction to the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The proposed framework incorporates all the relevant biological factors as well as the effects of individual behavioral reaction and government action such as travel restrictions, social distancing, hospitalization, quarantine and hygiene measures. Understanding the dynamics of this highly contagious SARS-CoV-2, which at present does not have any therapy assist the policy makers on evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures currently being implemented. Moreover, policy makers can have insights on short-and-long term dynamics of the disease. The proposed conceptual framework was combined with data on cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in South Africa, March 2020 to early May 2020. Overall, our work demonstrated optimal conditions necessary for the infection to die out as well as persist.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and content of nightmares during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, evaluating its associations with sociodemographic, occupational, and clinical factors. Cross-sectional exploratory study, including 1,057 participants who responded to an online survey about mental violence and nightmares during the pandemic, between May 25 and June 1, 2020. A descriptive analysis of the results was done to obtain frequency tables. McNemar's non-parametric test was used to compare the frequency of nightmares before and after the pandemic, and logistic regression models, to identify factors most strongly associated with the pandemic nightmares. Participants were from 21 Brazilian states, with a mean age of 38 +/- 14 years, and 78% women. Half of them (n = 529) reported at least one nightmare episode during the pandemic, and 32.9% (n = 348) described a pandemic content. There was nearly a 3-fold increase in the occurrence of nightmares "once a week or more" during the pandemic, 9% before vs. 25% after. Prior psychiatric care, suicidal ideation, sleep medication, increased pandemic alcohol consumption, perceiving high risk of contamination, being woman, and of younger age were factors associated with having nightmares during the pandemic. Prior psychiatric care, sleep medication, and age remained significant after excluding participants without nightmares and comparing between individuals with and without a pandemic content. We conclude the COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's dreams. The increase in the frequency of nightmares, their pandemic content, and association with previous conditions are a concerning public mental health issue and should be taken into consideration by authorities and policy makers.© Copyright © 2020 Musse, Castro, Sousa, Mestre, Teixeira, Pelloso, Poyares and Carvalho.},

   abstract = {Background: HIV is a growing public health burden that threatens thousands of people in Kazakhstan. Countries around the world, including Kazakhstan, are facing significant problems in predicting HIV infection prevalence. It is crucial to understand the epidemiological trends of infectious diseases and to monitor the prevalence of HIV in a long-term perspective. Thus, in this study, we aimed to forecast the prevalence of HIV in Kazakhstan for 10 years from 2020 to 2030 by using mathematical modeling and time series analysis. Method(s): We use statistical Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and a nonlinear epidemic Susceptible-Infected (SI) model to forecast the HIV infection prevalence rate in Kazakhstan. We estimated the parameters of the models using open data on the prevalence of HIV infection among women and men (aged 15-49 years) in Kazakhstan provided by the Kazakhstan Bureau of National Statistics. We also predict the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) control measures on the prevalence rate. Result(s): The ARIMA (1,2,0) model suggests that the prevalence of HIV infection in Kazakhstan will increase from 0.29 in 2021 to 0.47 by 2030. On the other hand, the SI model suggests that this parameter will increase to 0.60 by 2030 based on the same data. Both models were statistically significant by Akaike Information Criterion corrected (AICc) score and by the goodness of fit. HIV prevention under the PrEP strategy on the SI model showed a significant effect on the reduction of the HIV prevalence rate. Conclusion(s): This study revealed that ARIMA (1,2,0) predicts a linear increasing trend, while SI forecasts a nonlinear increase with a higher prevalence of HIV. Therefore, it is recommended for healthcare providers and policymakers use this model to calculate the cost required for the regional allocation of healthcare resources. Moreover, this model can be used for planning effective healthcare treatments.Copyright © 2023 Mussina et al.},

   abstract = {Background: Many countries in the world are still struggling to control COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub-Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations. Design and Methods: This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. Result(s): The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa with-in the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, other-wise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusion(s): Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error. Moreover, the model can be developed further to include more variables as more facts on the COVID-19 emerge.Copyright © the Author(s), 2021 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

   abstract = {Background: The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a very devastating impact at a global level, with the Eastern and Southern African region being the hardest hit. The considerable geographical variation in the pandemic means varying impact of the disease in different settings, requiring differentiated interventions. While information on the prevalence of HIV at regional and national levels is readily available, the burden of the disease at smaller area levels, where health services are organized and delivered, is not well documented. This affects the targeting of HIV resources. There is need, therefore, for studies to estimate HIV prevalence at appropriate levels to improve HIV-related planning and resource allocation. Method(s): We estimated the district-level prevalence of HIV using Small-Area Estimation (SAE) technique by utilizing the 2016 Zambia Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment Survey (ZAMPHIA) data and auxiliary data from the 2010 Zambian Census of Population and Housing and the HIV sentinel surveillance data from selected antenatal care clinics (ANC). SAE models were fitted in R Programming to ascertain the best HIV predicting model. We then used the Fay-Herriot (FH) model to obtain weighted, more precise and reliable HIV prevalence for all the districts. Result(s): The results revealed variations in the district HIV prevalence in Zambia, with the prevalence ranging from as low as 4.2% to as high as 23.5%. Approximately 32% of the districts (n = 24) had HIV prevalence above the national average, with one district having almost twice as much prevalence as the national level. Some rural districts have very high HIV prevalence rates. Conclusion(s): HIV prevalence in Zambian is highest in districts located near international borders, along the main transit routes and adjacent to other districts with very high prevalence. The variations in the burden of HIV across districts in Zambia point to the need for a differentiated approach in HIV programming within the country. HIV resources need to be prioritized toward districts with high population mobility.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   title = {Deaths during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from regional patterns in Germany and Poland},
   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {23},
   number = {1},
   pages = {177},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the nature of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, strong regional patterns in the fatal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic related to local characteristics such as population and health care infrastructures were to be expected. In this paper we conduct a detailed examination of the spatial correlation of deaths in the first year of the pandemic in two neighbouring countries - Germany and Poland, which, among high income countries, seem particularly different in terms of the death toll associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis aims to yield evidence that spatial patterns of mortality can provide important clues as to the reasons behind significant differences in the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in these two countries. METHOD(S): Based on official health and population statistics on the level of counties, we explore the spatial nature of mortality in 2020 in the two countries - which, as we show, reflects important contextual differences. We investigate three different measures of deaths: the officially recorded COVID-19 deaths, the total values of excessive deaths and the difference between the two. We link them to important pre-pandemic regional characteristics such as population, health care and economic conditions in multivariate spatial autoregressive models. From the point of view of pandemic related fatalities we stress the distinction between direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19, separating the latter further into two types, the spatial nature of which is likely to differ. RESULT(S): The COVID-19 pandemic led to much more excess deaths in Poland than in Germany. Detailed spatial analysis of deaths at the regional level shows a consistent pattern of deaths officially registered as related to COVID-19. For excess deaths, however, we find strong spatial correlation in Germany but little such evidence in Poland. CONCLUSION(S): In contrast to Germany, for Poland we do not observe the expected spatial pattern of total excess deaths and the excess deaths over and above the official COVID-19 deaths. This difference cannot be explained by pre-pandemic regional factors such as economic and population structures or by healthcare infrastructure. The findings point to the need for alternative explanations related to the Polish policy reaction to the pandemic and failures in the areas of healthcare and public health, which resulted in a massive loss of life.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {In this work, a new compartmental mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic has been proposed incorporating imperfect quarantine and disrespectful behavior of citizens towards lockdown policies, which are evident in most of the developing countries. An integer derivative model has been proposed initially and then the formula for calculating basic reproductive number, R0 of the model has been presented. Cameroon has been considered as a representative for the developing countries and the epidemic threshold, R0 has been estimated to be ~ 3.41 ( 95 % CI : 2.2 - 4.4 ) as of July 9, 2020. Using real data compiled by the Cameroonian government, model calibration has been performed through an optimization algorithm based on renowned trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm. Based on our projection results, the probable peak date is estimated to be on August 1, 2020 with approximately 1073 ( 95 % CI : 714 - 1654 ) daily confirmed cases. The tally of cumulative infected cases could reach ~ 20, 100 ( 95 % CI : 17 , 343 - 24 , 584 ) cases by the end of August 2020. Later, global sensitivity analysis has been applied to quantify the most dominating model mechanisms that significantly affect the progression dynamics of COVID-19. Importantly, Caputo derivative concept has been performed to formulate a fractional model to gain a deeper insight into the probable peak dates and sizes in Cameroon. By showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions, a numerical scheme has been constructed using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. Numerical simulations have enlightened the fact that if the fractional order alpha is close to unity, then the solutions will converge to the integer model solutions, and the decrease of the fractional-order parameter (0 < alpha < 1) leads to the delaying of the epidemic peaks.

   abstract = {The global pandemic of the 2019-nCov requires the evaluation of policy interventions to mitigate future social and economic costs of quarantine measures worldwide. We propose an epidemiological model for forecasting and policy evaluation which incorporates new data in real-time through variational data assimilation. We analyze and discuss infection rates in the UK, US and Italy. We furthermore develop a custom compartmental SIR model fit to variables related to the available data of the pandemic, named SITR model, which allows for more granular inference on infection numbers. We compare and discuss model results which conducts updates as new observations become available. A hybrid data assimilation approach is applied to make results robust to initial conditions and measurement errors in the data. We use the model to conduct inference on infection numbers as well as parameters such as the disease transmissibility rate or the rate of recovery. The parameterisation of the model is parsimonious and extendable, allowing for the incorporation of additional data and parameters of interest. This allows for scalability and the extension of the model to other locations or the adaption of novel data sources.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Due to the importance of control actions in spreading coronavirus disease, this paper is devoted to first modeling and then proposing an appropriate controller for this model. In the modeling procedure, we used a nonlinear mathematical model for the covid-19 outbreak to form a T-S fuzzy model. Then, for proposing the suitable controller, multiple optimization techniques including Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and mixed H2-H are taken into account. The mentioned controller is chosen because the model of corona-virus spread is not only full of disturbances like a sudden increase in infected people, but also noises such as unavailability of the exact number of each compartment. The controller is simulated accordingly to validate the results of mathematical calculations, and a comparative analysis is presented to investigate the different situations of the problem. Comparing the results of controlled and uncontrolled situations, it can be observed that we can tackle the devastating hazards of the covid-19 outbreak effectively if the suggested approaches and policies of controlling interventions are executed, appropriately.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Estimation of the effective reproduction number, R(t), of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in real-time is a continuing challenge. R(t) reflects the epidemic dynamics based on readily available illness onset data, and is useful for the planning and implementation of public health and social measures. In the present study, we proposed a method for computing the R(t) of COVID-19, and applied this method to the epidemic in Osaka prefecture from February to September 2020. We estimated R(t) as a function of the time of infection using the date of illness onset. The epidemic in Osaka came under control around 2 April during the first wave, and 26 July during the second wave. R(t) did not decline drastically following any single intervention. However, when multiple interventions were combined, the relative reductions in R(t) during the first and second waves were 70% and 51%, respectively. Although the second wave was brought under control without declaring a state of emergency, our model comparison indicated that relying on a single intervention would not be sufficient to reduce R(t) < 1. The outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rely on political leadership to swiftly design and implement combined interventions capable of broadly and appropriately reducing contacts.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile-phone data on population movement became publicly available, including Google Community Mobility Reports (CMR). This study explored the utilization of mobility data to predict COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, Indonesia. We acquired aggregated and anonymized mobility data sets from 15 February to 31 December 2020. Three statistical models were explored: Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Negative Binomial Regression GLM, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Due to multicollinearity, three categories were reduced into one single index using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multiple Linear Regression with variable adjustments using PCA was the best-fit model, explaining 52% of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta (R-Square: 0.52; p < 0.05). This study found that different types of mobility were significant predictors for COVID-19 cases and have different levels of impact on COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, with the highest observed in "grocery and pharmacy" (4.12%). This study demonstrates the practicality of using CMR data to help policymakers in decision making and policy formulation, especially when there are limited data available, and can be used to improve health system readiness by anticipating case surge, such as in the places with a high potential for transmission risk and during seasonal events.},

The methodology used was quantitative, the method was deductive of explanatory scope with a non-experimental cross-sectional design, since historical documentary sources published by the Association of Automotive Companies of Ecuador (AEADE) were used. According to the results obtained with this study, it was determined that in 2022, after the pandemic, there was an increase in the number of imported vehicles, a decrease in the number of vehicles sold that were assembled in the country, and there is no significant difference in the number of imported vehicles marketed in the country. In any of these cases, the implementation or updating of appropriate strategic planning in organizations that develop activities in the automotive field will allow the best performance of these and their greater validity in the market. Given these effects, the Government needs to support policies for the preservation of capacities and resources, as well as their subsequent strengthening to promote post-pandemic recovery. The model proposed as a product of the study is composed of 9 phases that allow to develop and apply strategic planning in companies in the automotive sector, this model arises from the review and adoption of the best practices found in four of the most used modelsto the global novel.Copyright © 2023, Anka Publishers.

   abstract = {As the Coronavirus contagion develops, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of the disease. Its severity is best described by two parameters: Its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: The final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.Copyright © 2020 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Finding out whether there are differences in the levels of stress and burnout between workers providing care to dependent adults and those caring for independent older adults would provide comparative information about two different models of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, workers caring for older adults were subjected to maladaptive situations that produced stress and burnout. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design using the STROBE checklist. METHOD(S): A total of 900 nursing home and egidas workers were assessed for stress and burnout. Data were collected online from October 2020 to February 2021, when Puerto Rico was experiencing the peak of the third wave of COVID-19. MANOVAs were performed to study the interactions between the workplace and having had COVID, the workplace and the size of institution and the workplace and position held. DATA SOURCES: October 2020 to February 2021. RESULT(S): All interactions were significant. Nursing homes showed higher levels of stress and burnout when workers had undergone COVID, when the size of the institution was larger and for technical staff other services; in egidas, having undergone COVID did not influence stress or burnout, which increased when the institution was smaller and for executive staff. CONCLUSION(S): This study showed that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affected nursing home workers more significantly than those working in other types of residential models with independent older adults. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: Applying preventive interventions aimed at reducing stress and burnout would facilitate the adaptation of workers caring for older adults and help to improve the quality of care. IMPACT: This study analysed the impact of COVID-19 on the stress and burnout of workers providing services to older adults. Nursing home workers who have had COVID-19 have higher stress and burnout. The size of the institution has a different effect depending on whether older adults are dependent or independent. Workers in institutions dedicated to the care of the older adults. REPORTING METHOD: This study has adhered to the relevant EQUATOR guidelines: STROBE. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: During the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was difficult to establish direct contact with workers providing care to older adults; this reason made it necessary to apply online systems to obtain information. The workers appreciated the fact that the implications for stress and burnout of the situation experienced during this difficult process were investigated.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   pages = {e0256971},
   abstract = {Studying the progress and trend of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) transmission mode will help effectively curb its spread. Some commonly used infectious disease prediction models are introduced. The hybrid model is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantages of the logistic model's inability to predict the number of confirmed diagnoses and the drawbacks of too many tuning parameters of the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. The realization and superiority of the prediction of the proposed model are proven through experiments. At the same time, the influence of different initial values of the parameters that need to be debugged on the hybrid model is further studied, and the mean error is used to quantify the prediction effect. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time and simulating the effects of public health interventions, this paper aims to clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviours are critical to slow down the epidemic.Copyright © 2021 Nawaz et al.

   abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns and trends of COVID-19 at a local spatial scale using Bayesian approaches are hardly observed in literature. Also, studies rarely use satellite-derived long time-series data on the environment to predict COVID-19 risk at a spatial scale. In this study, we modelled the COVID-19 pandemic risk using a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model that incorporates satellite-derived remote sensing data on land surface temperature (LST) from January 2020 to October 2021 (89 weeks) and several socioeconomic covariates of the 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto. The spatial patterns of risk were heterogeneous in space with multiple high-risk neighbourhoods in Western and Southern Toronto. Higher risk was observed during Spring 2021. The spatiotemporal risk patterns identified 60% of neighbourhoods had a stable, 37% had an increasing, and 2% had a decreasing trend over the study period. LST was positively, and higher education was negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence. We believe the use of Bayesian spatial modelling and the remote sensing technologies in this study provided a strong versatility and strengthened our analysis in identifying the spatial risk of COVID-19. The findings would help in prevention planning, and the framework of this study may be replicated in other highly transmissible infectious diseases.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Modelling the spatiotemporal spread of a highly transmissible disease is challenging. We developed a novel spatiotemporal spread model, and the neighbourhood-level data of COVID-19 in Toronto was fitted into the model to visualize the spread of the disease in the study area within two weeks of the onset of first outbreaks from index neighbourhood to its first-order neighbourhoods (called dispersed neighbourhoods). We also model the data to classify hotspots based on the overall incidence rate and persistence of the cases during the study period. The spatiotemporal spread model shows that the disease spread to 1-4 neighbourhoods bordering the index neighbourhood within two weeks. Some dispersed neighbourhoods became index neighbourhoods and further spread the disease to their nearby neighbourhoods. Most of the sources of infection in the dispersed neighbourhood were households and communities (49%), and after excluding the healthcare institutions (40%), it becomes 82%, suggesting the expansion of transmission was from close contacts. The classification of hotspots informs high-priority areas concentrated in the northwestern and northeastern parts of Toronto. The spatiotemporal spread model along with the hotspot classification approach, could be useful for a deeper understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases and planning for an effective mitigation strategy where local-level spatially enabled data are available.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Swiss health care system, affecting especially vulnerable people, such as patients suffering from dementia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the challenges experienced by dementia patients, their carers, and clinicians during the pandemic in Switzerland. Method(s): An online survey was sent to all memory clinics in the German speaking part of Switzerland. Patients diagnosed with dementia and their carers were recruited for semi-structured telephone interviews at the memory clinic of the University Hospital Zurich. Result(s): A total of 28 clinicians, 17 carers, and seven patients participated in this study. According to the clinicians, all aspects of clinical work were affected by the pandemic. Carers did not perceive a significant role of the pandemic in the disease progression of the patients, despite many challenges faced. Patients described a high level of conscientiousness during the pandemic. Recommendations for future scenarios were provided from all groups. Conclusion(s): In order to increase the systemic resilience of the Swiss health care system, it is important to consider the experiences and recommendations of vulnerable groups and health care professionals for future public health measures and policies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.},

   abstract = {The control of the initial outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 via the application of population-wide non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures have led to remarkable successes in dampening the pandemic globally. However, with countries beginning to ease or lift these measures fully to restart activities, concern is growing regarding the impacts that such reopening of societies could have on the subsequent transmission of the virus. While mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission have played important roles in evaluating the impacts of these measures for curbing virus transmission, a key need is for models that are able to effectively capture the effects of the spatial and social heterogeneities that drive the epidemic dynamics observed at the local community level. Iterative forecasting that uses new incoming epidemiological and social behavioral data to sequentially update locally-applicable transmission models can overcome this gap, potentially resulting in better predictions and policy actions. Here, we present the development of one such data-driven iterative modelling tool based on publicly available data and an extended SEIR model for forecasting SARS-CoV-2 at the county level in the United States. Using data from the state of Florida, we demonstrate the utility of such a system for exploring the outcomes of the social measures proposed by policy makers for containing the course of the pandemic. We provide comprehensive results showing how the locally identified models could be employed for accessing the impacts and societal tradeoffs of using specific social protective strategies. We conclude that it could have been possible to lift the more disruptive social interventions related to movement restriction/social distancing measures earlier if these were accompanied by widespread testing and contact tracing. These intensified social interventions could have potentially also brought about the control of the epidemic in low- and some medium-incidence county settings first, supporting the development and deployment of a geographically-phased approach to reopening the economy of Florida. We have made our data-driven forecasting system publicly available for policymakers and health officials to use in their own locales, so that a more efficient coordinated strategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 region-wide can be developed and successfully implemented.Copyright © 2022.

   journal = {Scientific reports},
   volume = {12},
   number = {1},
   pages = {7969},
   abstract = {From the end of 2019, one of the most serious and largest spread pandemics occurred in Wuhan (China) named Coronavirus (COVID-19). As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on people's lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the emerging Deep Learning (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves 0.98 [Formula: see text] and 0.012 MAPE at world level with 31-step forecast and up to 0.99 [Formula: see text] and 0.0026 MAPE at country level with 15-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   journal = {JMIR public health and surveillance},
   volume = {7},

   pages = {e28195},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been one of the most serious global health crises in world history. During the pandemic, health care systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Forecasting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. OBJECTIVE(S): The goal of this study was to explore the potential utility of local COVID-19 infection incidence data in developing a forecasting model for the COVID-19 hospital census. METHOD(S): The study data comprised aggregated daily COVID-19 hospital census data across 11 Atrium Health hospitals plus a virtual hospital in the greater Charlotte metropolitan area of North Carolina, as well as the total daily infection incidence across the same region during the May 15 to December 5, 2020, period. Cross-correlations between hospital census and local infection incidence lagging up to 21 days were computed. A multivariate time-series framework, called the vector error correction model (VECM), was used to simultaneously incorporate both time series and account for their possible long-run relationship. Hypothesis tests and model diagnostics were performed to test for the long-run relationship and examine model goodness of fit. The 7-days-ahead forecast performance was measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), with time-series cross-validation. The forecast performance was also compared with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model in the same cross-validation time frame. Based on different scenarios of the pandemic, the fitted model was leveraged to produce 60-days-ahead forecasts. RESULT(S): The cross-correlations were uniformly high, falling between 0.7 and 0.8. There was sufficient evidence that the two time series have a stable long-run relationship at the .01 significance level. The model had very good fit to the data. The out-of-sample MAPE had a median of 5.9% and a 95th percentile of 13.4%. In comparison, the MAPE of the ARIMA had a median of 6.6% and a 95th percentile of 14.3%. Scenario-based 60-days-ahead forecasts exhibited concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2 to 3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. In the worst-case scenario, the COVID-19 hospital census can reach a peak over 3 times greater than the peak observed during the second wave. CONCLUSION(S): When used in the VECM framework, the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be an effective leading indicator to predict the COVID-19 hospital census. The VECM model had a very good 7-days-ahead forecast performance and outperformed the traditional ARIMA model. Leveraging the relationship between the two time series, the model can produce realistic 60-days-ahead scenario-based projections, which can inform health care systems about the peak timing and volume of the hospital census for long-term planning purposes.Copyright ©Hieu M Nguyen, Philip J Turk, Andrew D McWilliams.

   abstract = {Phenomenological models are popular for describing the epidemic curve. We present how they can be used at different phases in the epidemic, by modelling the daily number of new hospitalisations (or cases). As real-time prediction of the hospital capacity is important, a joint model of the new hospitalisations, number of patients in hospital and in intensive care unit (ICU) is proposed. This model allows estimation of the length of stay in hospital and ICU, even if no (or limited) individual level information on length of stay is available. Estimation is done in a Bayesian framework. In this framework, real-time alarms, defined as the probability of exceeding hospital capacity, can be easily derived. The methods are illustrated using data from the COVID-19 pandemic in March-June 2020 in Belgium, but are widely applicable.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press},

   journal = {Public Health},
   volume = {170},
   pages = {17-22},
   abstract = {Objectives: Disease burden and high financial cost of seasonal influenza emphasize the importance of studying the epidemics transmission dynamics. Our aim in this article is to extend the Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, a well-studied classical compartmental epidemic model, by incorporating socio-environmental factors. Particularly, the potential influence of mass media function and absolute humidity are examined on the model simultaneously. Study design: The proposed model is fitted to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza data of region five of the US for four outbreak seasons. Then, a full-performance comparison between the conventional and extended model is carried out. Method(s): Implementing the mass media and climate factors into the classical epidemic models, e.g., Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) and SEIR, is a promising and ongoing research field in the public health area. In this article, we particularly address the potential effect of mass media and absolute humidity to modify the SEIR model. Result(s): Computational simulations are carried out for both standard and extended models for four influenza seasons in CDC region five of the US. Moreover, the accuracy assessment is performed based on the following criteria: i) the root mean square error (RMSE); ii) the Akaike information criterion (AIC); iii) the outbreak peak time; and iv) the number of infected individuals at the peak time. Based on these criteria, the proposed model provided a better fit than a null model with smaller RMSE and AIC values for the last three study seasons. Specifically, RMSE values declined from 20 to 11.08 and from 26.87 to 19.15 for seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12, respectively; also, lower AIC values for these seasons indicate that the modified SEIR (referred to M-SEIR) model is a better-fitting model. Conclusion(s): Parameter estimation techniques are important tools to determine the key parameters of the epidemic models. Based on our results, introducing the mass media and climate factors into the classic models will improve the model precision.Copyright © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of people have been infected worldwide in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aim to propose fourteen prediction models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the COVID-19 outbreak for policy makers. METHOD(S): The ANN-based models were utilized to estimate the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Italy, South Africa and United States of America. These models exploit historical records of confirmed cases, while their main difference is the number of days that they assume to have impact on the estimation process. The COVID-19 data were divided into a train part and a test part. The former was used to train the ANN models, while the latter was utilized to compare the purposes. The data analysis shows not only significant fluctuations in the daily confirmed cases but also different ranges of total confirmed cases observed in the time interval considered. RESULT(S): Based on the obtained results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous 14days outperforms the other ones. This comparison reveals the importance of considering the maximum incubation period in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the ranges of determination coefficients indicates that the estimated results for Italy are the best one. Moreover, the predicted results for Iran achieved the ranges of [0.09, 0.15] and [0.21, 0.36] for the mean absolute relative errors and normalized root mean square errors, respectively, which were the best ranges obtained for these criteria among different countries. CONCLUSION(S): Based on the achieved results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous fourteen days for prediction is suggested to predict daily confirmed cases, particularly in countries that have experienced the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study has not only proved the applicability of ANN-based model for prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also showed that considering incubation period of SARS-COV-2 in prediction models may generate more accurate estimations.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has become a concern of every nation, and it is crucial to apply an estimation model with a favorably-high accuracy to provide an accurate perspective of the situation. In this study, three explicit mathematical prediction models were applied to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey. These models include a recursive-based method, Boltzmann Function-based model and Beesham's prediction model. These models were exploited to analyze the confirmed and death cases of the first 106 and 87 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey, respectively. This application indicates that the three models fail to predict the first 10 to 20 days of data, depending on the prediction model. On the other hand, the results obtained for the rest of the data demonstrate that the three prediction models achieve high values for the determination coefficient, whereas they yielded to different average absolute relative errors. Based on the comparison, the recursive-based model performs the best, while it estimated the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran better than that of in Turkey. Impacts of applying or relaxing control measurements like curfew in Turkey and reopening the low-risk businesses in Iran were investigated through the recursive-based model. Finally, the results demonstrate the merit of the recursive-based model in analyzing various scenarios, which may provide suitable information for health politicians and public health decision-makers.Copyright © 2020 Majid Niazkar et al.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To zoning the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Villavicencio, Colombia, through a multi-criteria spatial evaluation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-criteria evaluation model was implemented, through a hierarchical analysis process, integrated into a Geographic Information System. As criteria, descriptive attributes of the threats and vulnerabilities of viral transmission identified by means of an epidemiological model were included, on the same dimensionless numerical scale and proportional to the probability of contagion; the alternatives evaluated correspond to spatial entities represented by pixels. The criteria were weighted according to the expert judgment of the evaluators, with whom the calculation of a normalized matrix of relative priorities was performed, which allowed the estimation of a vector of weights, the degree of inconsistency of which was admissible. The magnitude of the risk was calculated with a weighted summation of the evaluation of the criteria, according to a map algebra geoprocessing., RESULTS: The spatial heterogeneity of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was described in Villavicencio, allowing the identification of the areas with the highest probability of transmission, located in neighborhoods characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerability., CONCLUSIONS: The cartographic representation derived from the implementation of a multicriteria model, integrated to a Geographical Information System, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk analysis, constitutes a relevant methodological contribution for decision-making defining strategies of mitigation at the local level, facilitating the location and optimization of resources by the health authorities.},

   abstract = {In this manuscript, we developed a nonlinear fractional order Ebola virus with a novel piecewise hybrid technique to observe the dynamical transmission having eight compartments. The existence and uniqueness of a solution of piecewise derivative is treated for a system with Arzel'a-Ascoli and Schauder conditions. We investigate the effects of classical and modified fractional calculus operators, specifically the classical Caputo piecewise operator, on the behavior of the model. A model shows that a completely continuous operator is uniformly continuous, and bounded according to the equilibrium points. The reproductive number R0 is derived for the biological feasibility of the model with sensitivity analysis with different parameters impact on the model. Sensitivity analysis is an essential tool for comprehending how various model parameters affect the spread of illness. Through a methodical manipulation of important parameters and an assessment of their impact on Ro, we are able to learn more about the resiliency and susceptibility of the model. Local stability is established with next Matignon method and global stability is conducted with the Lyapunov function for a feasible solution of the proposed model. In the end, a numerical solution is derived with Newton's polynomial technique for a piecewise Caputo operator through simulations of the compartments at various fractional orders by using real data. Our findings highlight the importance of fractional operators in enhancing the accuracy of the model in capturing the intricate dynamics of the disease. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of Ebola virus dynamics and provides valuable insights for improving disease modeling and public health strategies.Copyright © 2024 Nisar et al.

   abstract = {To understand the time-dependent risk of infection on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, I estimated the incidence of infection with novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Background: Concerns regarding symptom severity and the risk of relapse among people seeking recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been raised since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to preventive measures implemented during the pandemic (social distancing or lockdown), self-help group (SHG) meetings were restricted. However, the impact of deprivation of onsite recovery meetings on drinking behavior and risk among SHG members with AUD remains unclear. We examined the proportion of SHG members who reported drinking and their reasons for drinking during the early stages of the pandemic and the effect of nonattendance at onsite recovery meetings on drinking behavior during the early pandemic period, stratified by gender. Method(s): A national cross-sectional survey of Japanese SHG members was conducted to measure self-reported alcohol consumption, sociodemographic characteristics, AUD diagnosis, treatment status, SHG meeting attendance, membership duration, psychological distress, and health-related variables. Of 6478 SHG members, 2955 (male: n = 2678; female: n = 277; response rate: 46.7%) responded, and the responses were analyzed using a gender-stratified multivariate logistic regression model. Result(s): Most participants reported having abstained from alcohol use, while 6% of the respondents reported having consumed alcohol during the early stages of the pandemic. The proportion of "drinkers" among women (10.5%) was significantly higher than that among men (5.9%; p = 0.012). Through multivariate model analysis, the factors associated with drinking during the pandemic were identified as psychological distress (among men and women) and not attending onsite recovery meetings (among men). Conversely, a longer duration of SHG membership was associated with less drinking during the pandemic for both genders. Conclusion(s): Most SHG members appear to have remained abstinent during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, psychological distress in both genders and the inability to attend recovery meetings among men may have influenced drinking behavior.Copyright © 2023 Research Society on Alcohol.},

   abstract = {Since the first two novel coronavirus cases appeared in January of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic seriously threatens the public health of Italy. In this article, the distribution characteristics and spreading of COVID-19 in various regions of Italy were analysed by heat maps. Meanwhile, spatial autocorrelation, spatiotemporal clustering analysis and kernel density method were also applied to analyse the spatial clustering of COVID-19. The results showed that the Italian epidemic has a temporal trend and spatial aggregation. The epidemic was concentrated in northern Italy and gradually spread to other regions. Finally, the Google Trends index of the COVID-19 epidemic was further employed to build a prediction model combined with machine learning algorithms. By using Adaboost algorithm for single-factor modelling,the results show that the AUC of these six features (mask, pneumonia, thermometer, ISS, disinfection and disposable gloves) are all >0.9, indicating that these features have a large contribution to the prediction model. It is also implied that the public's attention to the epidemic is increasing as well as the awareness of the need for protective measures. This increased awareness of the epidemic will prompt the public to pay more attention to protective measures, thereby reducing the risk of coronavirus infection.Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

   abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, real-time social media data could in principle be used as an early predictor of a new epidemic wave. This possibility is examined here by employing a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) trained to forecast viral outbreaks in a specific geographic region. It learns from multivariate time series of signals derived from a novel set of large online polls regarding COVID-19 symptoms. Once trained, the neural ODE can capture the dynamics of interconnected local signals and effectively estimate the number of new infections up to two months in advance. In addition, it may predict the future consequences of changes in the number of infected at a certain period, which might be related with the flow of individuals entering or exiting a region. This study provides persuasive evidence for the predictive ability of widely disseminated social media surveys for public health applications.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).},

We develop simple COVID-19 epidemic models to study treatment strategies to control the pandemic. The results show that eradication of the disease is possible if the efficacy of treatment is perfect. We also investigate the existence of a dual-rate effect. Conditions under which the effect occurs are derived. When the effect is present, a tactic to control the infection might be to initially treat infected individuals aggressively at a relatively high rate to drive the prevalence to a lower region that can be maintained in the long run at relatively moderate rate and cost.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   journal = {Journal of medical Internet research},
   volume = {22},
   number = {10},
   pages = {e21955},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Great COVID-19 Shutdown aimed to eliminate or slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The United States has no national policy, leaving states to independently implement public health guidelines that are predicated on a sustained decline in COVID-19 cases. Operationalization of "sustained decline" varies by state and county. Existing models of COVID-19 transmission rely on parameters such as case estimates or R0 and are dependent on intensive data collection efforts. Static statistical models do not capture all of the relevant dynamics required to measure sustained declines. Moreover, existing COVID-19 models use data that are subject to significant measurement error and contamination., OBJECTIVE: This study will generate novel metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day lag in the speed of COVID-19 transmission using state government tallies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including state-level dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This study provides the prototype for a global surveillance system to inform public health practice, including novel standardized metrics of COVID-19 transmission, for use in combination with traditional surveillance tools., METHODS: Dynamic panel data models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique allows for the control of a variety of deficiencies in the existing data. Tests of the validity of the model and statistical techniques were applied., RESULTS: The statistical approach was validated based on the regression results, which determined recent changes in the pattern of infection. During the weeks of August 17-23 and August 24-30, 2020, there were substantial regional differences in the evolution of the US pandemic. Census regions 1 and 2 were relatively quiet with a small but significant persistence effect that remained relatively unchanged from the prior 2 weeks. Census region 3 was sensitive to the number of tests administered, with a high constant rate of cases. A weekly special analysis showed that these results were driven by states with a high number of positive test reports from universities. Census region 4 had a high constant number of cases and a significantly increased persistence effect during the week of August 24-30. This change represents an increase in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a re-emergence of the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Reopening the United States comes with three certainties: (1) the "social" end of the pandemic and reopening are going to occur before the "medical" end even while the pandemic is growing. We need improved standardized surveillance techniques to inform leaders when it is safe to open sections of the country; (2) varying public health policies and guidelines unnecessarily result in varying degrees of transmission and outbreaks; and (3) even those states most successful in containing the pandemic continue to see a small but constant stream of new cases daily.

   abstract = {Variation in free-living microparasite survival can have a meaningful impact on the ecological dynamics of established and emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.},

   abstract = {Pandemic defines the global outbreak of a disease having a high transmission rate. The impact of a pandemic situation can be lessened by restricting the movement of the mass. However, one of its concomitant circumstances is an economic crisis. In this article, we demonstrate what actions an agent (trained using reinforcement learning) may take in different possible scenarios of a pandemic depending on the spread of disease and economic factors. To train the agent, we design a virtual pandemic scenario closely related to the present COVID-19 crisis. Then, we apply reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that deals with how an individual (human/machine) should interact on an environment (real/virtual) to achieve the cherished goal. Finally, we demonstrate what optimal actions the agent perform to reduce the spread of disease while considering the economic factors. In our experiment, we let the agent find an optimal solution without providing any prior knowledge. After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent's performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease. The estimation and policy of the agent may improve the human-strategy of placing lockdown so that an economic crisis may be avoided while mitigating an infectious disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically changed societies in 2020. Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust., METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country., RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months. The results indicated the importance of timely restrictions and cooperation with people. Copyright ©Atte Oksanen, Markus Kaakinen, Rita Latikka, Iina Savolainen, Nina Savela, Aki Koivula.

We have developed a deterministic epidemiological SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to quantify the required time and efficacy to bring the COVID-19 outbreak under control in Iran. Our results showed that the efficacy of COVID-19 confronting strategies on Feb 29th and March 9th were at 0.5 and 0.7, respectively owing to the relative equivalence number of infected cases estimated by the model and national officially reported cases. Therefore, to control the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran we strongly recommend maintaining the effectiveness of interventions at 0.7 or more at least for the next 4-6 weeks. Because the COVID-19 declining statistics over the next few days or weeks do not mean the definitive control of the outbreak.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is affecting healthcare resources worldwide, with lower and middle-income countries being particularly disadvantaged to mitigate the challenges imposed by the disease, including the availability of a sufficient number of infirmary/ICU hospital beds, ventilators, and medical supplies. Here, we use mathematical modelling to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Bahia, a state in northeastern Brazil, considering the influences of asymptomatic/non-detected cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. The impacts of policies on the transmission rate were also examined. Our results underscore the difficulties in maintaining a fully operational health infrastructure amidst the pandemic. Lowering the transmission rate is paramount to this objective, but current local efforts, leading to a 36% decrease, remain insufficient to prevent systemic collapse at peak demand, which could be accomplished using periodic interventions. Non-detected cases contribute to a ~55% increase in R0. Finally, we discuss our results in light of epidemiological data that became available after the initial analyses.},

   abstract = {The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide. Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the pandemic's course with great accuracy and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to seven days ahead and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has substantial implications for global planning and decision making. We present forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.},

   abstract = {One important variable influencing day-to-day decisions in COVID-19 pandemic has been an impending shortage of mechanical ventilators due to the large number of people that become infected with the virus due to its high contagiousness. We developed a stepwise Markov model (a) to make a short-term prediction of the number of patients on ventilator, and (b) to determine a possible date for a ventilator crisis. Starting with the exponential curve of new cases in the previous 14 days, we calculated a Markov model every 5 days thereafter, resulting in a daily estimate of patients on ventilator for the following 25 days, which we compared with the daily number of devices in use to predict a date for ventilator crisis. During the modeled period, the observed and predicted Markov curves of patients on ventilator were very similar, a finding confirmed by both linear regression (r=0.984; p<0.0001) and the near coincidence with the identity line. Our model estimated ventilator shortage in Chile for June 1st, if the number of devices had remained stable. However, the crisis did not occur due to acquisition of new ventilators by the Ministry of Health. In Chile as in many other countries experiencing several asynchronous local peaks of COVID-19, the stepwise Markov model could become a useful tool for predicting the date of mechanical ventilator crisis. We propose that our model could help health authorities to: (a) establish a better ventilator distribution strategy and (b) be ready to reinstate restrictions only when necessary so as not to paralyze the economy as much.Copyright © 2021 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

   abstract = {Following its identification in late 2019, COVID-19 has spread around the globe, and been declared a pandemic. With this in mind, modelling the spread of COVID-19 remains important for responding effectively. To date research has focused primarily on modelling the spread of COVID-19 on national and regional scales with just a few studies doing so on a city and sub-city scale. However, no attempts have yet been made to design and optimize a model explicitly for accurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 at sub-city scale. This research aimed to address this research gap by developing an experimental LSTM-ANN deep learning model. The model is largely autoregressive in nature as it considers temporally lagged borough-level COVID-19 cases data from the last 9 days, but also considers temporally lagged (i) borough-level NO2 concentration data, (ii) government stringency data, and (iii) climatic data from the last 9 days, as well as non-temporally variable borough-level urban characteristics data when modelling and forecasting the spread of the disease. The model was also encouraged to learn the spatial relationships between boroughs with regards to the spread of COVID-19 by a novel MSE-Moran's I loss function. Overall, the model's performance appears promising and so the model represents a useful tool for assisting the decision making and interventions of governing bodies within cities. A sensitivity analysis also indicated that of the non COVID-19 variables, the government stringency is particularly important in the modelling process, with this being closely followed by the climatic variables, the NO2 concentration data, and finally the urban characteristics data. Additionally, the introduction of the novel MSE-Moran's I loss function appeared to improve the model's forecasting performance, and so this research has implications at the intersection of deep learning and disease modelling. It may also have implications within spatio-temporal forecasting more generally because such a feature may have the potential to improve forecasting in other spatio-temporal applications.

   abstract = {Infectious disease epidemics are challenging for medical and public health practitioners. They require prompt treatment, but it is challenging to recognize and define epidemics in real time. Knowing the prediction of an infectious disease epidemic can evaluate and prevent the disease's impact. Mathematical models of epidemics that work in real time are important tools for preventing disease, and data-driven deep learning enables practical algorithms for identifying parameters in mathematical models. In this paper, the SIR model was reduced to a logistic differential equation involving a constant parameter and a time-dependent function. The time-dependent function leads to constant, rational, and birational models. These models use several constant parameters from the available data to predict the time and number of people reported to be infected with the COVID-19 Omicron variant. Two out of these three models, rational and birational, provide accurate predictions for countries that practice strict mitigation measures, but fail to provide accurate predictions for countries that practice partial mitigation measures. Therefore, we introduce a time-series model based on neural networks to predict the time and number of people reported to be infected with the COVID-19 Omicron variant in a given country that practices both partial and strict mitigation measures. A logistics-informed neural network algorithm was also introduced. This algorithm takes as input the daily and cumulative number of people who are reported to be infected with the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the given country. The algorithm helps determine the analytical solution involving several constant parameters for each model from the available data. The accuracy of these models is demonstrated using error metrics on Omicron variant data for Portugal, Italy, and China. Our findings demonstrate that the constant model could not accurately predict the daily or cumulative infections of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the observed country because of the long series of existing data of the epidemics. However, the rational and birational models accurately predicted cumulative infections in countries adopting strict mitigation measures, but they fell short in predicting the daily infections. Furthermore, both models performed poorly in countries with partial mitigation measures. Notably, the time-series model stood out for its versatility, effectively predicting both daily and cumulative infections in countries irrespective of the stringency of their mitigation measures.},

   abstract = {The study of COVID-19 pandemic which paralyzed global economy of countries is a crucial research area for effective future planning against other epidemics. Unfortunately, we now have variants of the disease resulting to what is now known as waves of the pandemic. Several mathematical models have been developed to study this disease. While recent models incorporated control measures, others are without optimal control measures or demographic parameters. In this study, we propose a deterministic compartmental epidemiological model to study the transmission dynamic of the spread of the third wave of the pandemic in Nigeria, and we incorporated optimal control measures as strategies to reduce the burden of the deadly disease. Specifically, we investigated the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 model without demographic features. We then conducted theoretical analysis of the model with and without optimal control strategy. In the model without optimal control, we computed the reproduction number, an epidemiological threshold useful for bringing the third wave of the pandemic under check in Nigeria, and we proofed the disease stability and conducted sensitivity analysis in order to identify parameters that can impact the reproduction number tremendously. In a similar reasoning, for the model with control strategy, we check the necessary condition for the model. To validate our theoretical analyses, we illustrated the applications of the proposed model using COVID-19 data for Nigeria for a period when the country was under the yoke of the third wave of the disease. The data were then fitted to the model, and we derived a predictive tool toward making a forecast for the cumulative number of cases of infection, cumulative number of active cases and the peak of the third wave of the pandemic. From the simulations, it was observed that the presence of optimal control parameters leads to significant impact on the reduction of the spread of the disease. However, it was discovered that the success of the control of the disease relies on the proper and effective implementation of the optimal control strategies efficiently and adequately.

   abstract = {Social distancing interrupted transmission patterns of contact-driven infectious agents such as norovirus during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since routine surveillance of norovirus was additionally disrupted during the pandemic, traditional naive forecasts that rely only on past public health surveillance data may not reliably represent norovirus activity. This study investigates the use of statistical modelling to predict the number of norovirus laboratory reports in England 4-weeks ahead of time before and during Covid-19 pandemic thus providing insights to inform existing practices in norovirus surveillance in England. We compare the predictive performance from three forecasting approaches that assume different underlying structure of the norovirus data and utilized various external data sources including mobility, air temperature and relative internet searches (Time Series and Regularized Generalized Linear Model, and Quantile Regression Forest). The performance of each approach was evaluated using multiple metrics, including a relative prediction error against the traditional naive forecast of a five-season mean. Our data suggest that all three forecasting approaches improve predictive performance over the naive forecasts, especially in the 2020/21 season (30-45% relative improvement) when the number of norovirus reports reduced. The improvement ranged from 7 to 22% before the pandemic. However, performance varied: regularized regression incorporating internet searches showed the best forecasting score pre-pandemic and the time series approach achieved the best results post pandemic onset without external data. Overall, our results demonstrate that there is a significant value for public health in considering the adoption of more sophisticated forecasting tools, moving beyond traditional naive methods, and utilizing available software to enhance the precision and timeliness of norovirus surveillance in England.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading over the world and puts the health systems of countries under intense pressure. High hospitalization levels due to the pandemic outbreak have caused the intensive care units to work above capacity., PURPOSE: A data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling approach was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of regions (i.e. city, country or clinical commissioning groups) against the pandemic outbreak. The objective is to enable related authorities better manage the struggle against the outbreak and put in place the emergency action plans immediately., METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DEA method was used to measure the efficiency scores of countries. Super efficiency DEA method was also applied to countries based on the level of efficiencies they have achieved. Sixteen countries were selected that have been facing with Covid19 pandemic outbreak for at least 5 consecutive weeks after their 100th confirmed case., RESULTS: A total of 80 DEA models were developed, that is, 16 DEA models for each week. The percentage of efficient countries decreased dramatically over time, from 43.75% in the first week to 25% in the fifth week. Unlike most European countries, China and South Korea increased their effectiveness after first week of implementing all the necessary measures., CONCLUSION: This study sheds light into better understanding the effectiveness of policies adopted by countries and their management strategy in dealing with Covid19 pandemic. Our model will enable political leaders to identify inadequate policies as quickly as possible and learn from their peers for more effective decisions. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   journal = {BMC Infectious Diseases},
   volume = {19},
   number = {1},
   pages = {902},
   abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diseases are globally acknowledged as a public health challenge that exhibits adverse bidirectional relations due to the co-epidemic overlap. To understand the co-infection burden we used the case notification data to generate spatiotemporal maps that described the distribution and exposure hypotheses for further epidemiologic investigations in areas with unusual case notification levels. Method(s): We analyzed the TB and TB-HIV case notification data from the Kenya national TB control program aggregated for forty-seven counties over a seven-year period (2012-2018). Using spatiotemporal poisson regression models within the Integrated Nested Laplace Approach (INLA) paradygm, we modeled the risk of TB-HIV co-infection. Six competing models with varying space-time formulations were compared to determine the best fit model. We then assessed the geographic patterns and temporal trends of coinfection risk by mapping the posterior marginal from the best fit model. Result(s): Of the total 608,312 TB case notifications, 194,129 were HIV co-infected. The proportion of TB-HIV co-infection was higher in females (39.7%) than in males (27.0%). A significant share of the co-infection was among adults aged 35 to 44 years (46.7%) and 45 to 54 years (42.1%). Based on the Bayesian Defiance Information (DIC) and the effective number of parameters (pD) comparisons, the spatiotemporal model allowing space-time interaction was the best in explaining the geographical variations in TB-HIV coinfection. The model results suggested that the risk of TB-HIV coinfection was influenced by infrastructure index (Relative risk (RR) = 5.75, Credible Interval (Cr.I) = (1.65, 19.89)) and gender ratio (RR = 5.81e-04, Cr. I = (1.06e-04, 3.18e-03). The lowest and highest temporal relative risks were in the years 2016 at 0.9 and 2012 at 1.07 respectively. The spatial pattern presented an increased co-infection risk in a number of counties. For the spatiotemporal interaction, only a few counties had a relative risk greater than 1 that varied in different years. Conclusion(s): We identified elevated risk areas for TB/HIV co-infection and fluctuating temporal trends which could be because of improved TB case detection or surveillance bias caused by spatial heterogeneity in the co-infection dynamics. Focused interventions and continuous TB-HIV surveillance will ensure adequate resource allocation and significant reduction of HIV burden amongst TB patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Objectives: This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a theoretical model to explain the relationships among participation in individual and social activities, compliance with prevention guidelines, and the perception of fatalism and fear of COVID-19. Method(s): Cross-sectional survey of 1,067 participants who were >18 years of age living in different provinces of Turkey recruited between August 15, 2020 and October 15, 2020. We used covariant structural analysis to assess the relationships of the constructs of the theoretical model. Result(s): Significant fits were detected for Model 1 (chi2 = 924,389, p <.001, comparative fit index or CFI = 0.944), and for Model 2 (chi2 = 2,253,751, p <.001, CFI = 0.926). The predetermination and luck subdimensions reduce the fear of COVID-19, while the pessimism subdimension and compliance with preventive measures increase the fear. Conclusion(s): In public health crises such as COVID-19, it is important to plan scientific knowledge-based public education; take initiatives in accordance with the cultural, social, economic, religious, and local characteristics of the societies; and conduct public health studies covering the whole society.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   pages = {e0297476},
   abstract = {This paper mainly addressed the study of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and analysed the effect of two different types of viruses simultaneously that cause immunodeficiency in the host. The two infectious diseases that often spread in the populace are HIV and measles. The interaction between measles and HIV can cause severe illness and even fatal patient cases. The effects of the measles virus on the host with HIV infection are studied using a mathematical model and their dynamics. Analysing the dynamics of infectious diseases in communities requires the use of mathematical models. Decisions about public health policy are influenced by mathematical modeling, which sheds light on the efficacy of various control measures, immunization plans, and interventions. We build a mathematical model for disease spread through vertical and horizontal human population transmission, including six coupled nonlinear differential equations with logistic growth. The fundamental reproduction number is examined, which serves as a cutoff point for determining the degree to which a disease will persist or die. We look at the various disease equilibrium points and investigate the regional stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points in the feasible region of the epidemic model. Concurrently, the global stability of the equilibrium points is investigated using the Lyapunov functional approach. Finally, the Runge-Kutta method is utilised for numerical simulation, and graphic illustrations are used to evaluate the impact of different factors on the spread of the illness. Critical factors that effect the dynamics of disease transmission and greatly affect the rate and range of the disease's spread in the population have been determined through a thorough analysis. These factors are crucial in determining the expansion of the disease.Copyright © 2024 Ozsahin et al.

Here, we evaluate the performance of 12 individual models and 19 predictors to anticipate French COVID-19-related health care needs from September 7, 2020, toMarch 6, 2021.We then build an ensemble model by combining the individual forecasts and retrospectively test this model from March 7, 2021, to July 6, 2021. We find that the inclusion of early predictors (epidemiological, mobility, and meteorological predictors) can halve the rms error for 14-d-ahead forecasts, with epidemiological and mobility predictors contributing the most to the improvement. On average, the ensemble model is the best or second-best model, depending on the evaluation metric. Our approach facilitates the comparison and benchmarking of competing models through their integration in a coherent analytical framework, ensuring that avenues for future improvements can be identified.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic that has been affecting Portugal since 2 March 2020. The Portuguese government has been making efforts to contradict the exponential growth through lockdown, social distancing and the usage of masks. However, these measures have been implemented without controlling the compliance degree and how much is necessary to achieve an effective control. To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the strength of Government-Imposed Measures (GIM) and predict the impact of the degree of compliance on the number of infected cases and peak of infection. We estimate the peak to be around 650 thousand infected cases with 53 thousand requiring hospital care by the beginning of May if no measures were taken. The model shows that the population compliance of the GIM was gradual between 30% to 75%, contributing to a significant reduction on the infection peak and mortality. Importantly, our simulations show that the infection burden could have been further reduced if the population followed the GIM immediately after their release on 18 March.Copyright © 2020 Pais RJ and Taveira N.},

   pages = {107289},
   abstract = {PURPOSE: This paper proposes a methodology and a computational tool to study the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world and to perform a trend analysis to assess its local dynamics., METHODS: Mathematical functions are employed to describe the number of cases and demises in each region and to predict their final numbers, as well as the dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public policies. Easy to interpret metrics over the quality of the fitted curves are provided. Country-wise data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concerning the daily number of cases and demises around the world are used, as well as detailed data from Johns Hopkins University and from the Brasil.io project describing individually the occurrences in United States counties and in Brazilian states and cities, respectively. U. S. and Brazil were chosen for a more detailed analysis because they are the current focus of the pandemic., RESULTS: Illustrative results for different countries, U. S. counties and Brazilian states and cities are presented and discussed., CONCLUSION: The main contributions of this work lie in (i) a straightforward model of the curves to represent the data, which allows automation of the process without requiring interventions from experts; (ii) an innovative approach for trend analysis, whose results provide important information to support authorities in their decision-making process; and (iii) the developed computational tool, which is freely available and allows the user to quickly update the COVID-19 analyses and forecasts for any country, United States county or Brazilian state or city present in the periodic reports from the authorities.

   abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.Copyright © 2020 Paiva et al.

   number = {6},
   pages = {e0286501},
   abstract = {The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it is currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear a rapid influx of patients overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as using social distancing to decrease the rate of newly infected people. This is what is usually meant by flattening the curve. In this paper, we use queueing theoretic methods to analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with time inhomogeneous Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressive societal policy needs to be to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how curve flattening impacts the elapsed lag between the times of the peak rate of hospitalizations and the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from Italy and the United States that supports the insights from our model analysis.

   abstract = {The rapid suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains a priority for maintaining public health security throughout the world, and the agile adjustment of government prevention and control strategies according to the spread of the epidemic is crucial for controlling the spread of the epidemic. Thus, in this study, a multi-agent modeling approach was developed for constructing an assessment model for the rapid suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission under government control. Different from previous mathematical models, this model combines computer technology and geographic information system to abstract human beings in different states into micro-agents with self-control and independent decision-making ability; defines the rules of agent behavior and interaction; and describes the mobility, heterogeneity, contact behavior patterns, and dynamic interactive feedback mechanism of space environment. The real geospatial and social environment in Taiyuan was considered as a case study. In the implemented model, the government agent could adjust the response level and prevention and control policies for major public health emergencies in real time according to the development of the epidemic, and different intervention strategies were provided to improve disease control methods in the simulation experiment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is widely applicable, and it can not only judge the effectiveness of intervention measures in time but also analyze the virus transmission status in complex urban systems and its change trend under different intervention measures, thereby providing scientific guidance to support urban public health safety.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

These short-term forecasts were needed to support planning efforts by providing decision-makers with insight about future demands for health care capacity and resources. We present a SARIMA time-series model called Gecko developed for this purpose. We evaluate its historical performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, predictive interval coverage, and weighted interval scores, and compare to alternative hospital admission forecasting models. We find that Gecko outperformed baseline approaches and was among the most accurate models for forecasting hospital admissions at the state and national levels from January-May 2021.

   abstract = {Obtaining reasonable estimates for transmission rates from observed data is a challenge when using mathematical models to study the dynamics of ?infectious? diseases, like Ebola. Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion either does not vary over time or change in a fixed pre-determined adhoc ways. However, these rates do vary during an outbreak due to multitude of factors such as environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease, which are in-part guided by changing size of an outbreak. We derive analytical estimates of time-dependent transmission rate for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence using a standard mathematical SIR-type epidemic model. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that time-dependent transmission rate estimates can have a large variation, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem better and can be utilized to understand disease progression more accurately.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Background: The monkeypox epidemic in the UK began in May 2022. Unexpectedly and rapidly, rates of new cases declined during August 2022. Identifying the causes of this decline requires accurate estimates of the timevarying epidemic growth rate, which in turn depend upon the delay between symptom onset to healthcare presentation. In this paper, we utilise modelling and monkeypox data from the UK to quantify the changes in this delay and their effect on estimating the epidemic growth rate of monkeypox over the period May-August 2022 in the UK. Method(s): We developed a custom nowcasting Bayesian method which incorporates time-varying delays (EpiLine), simulating the growth rate of symptomatic cases and the parameters of delay distributions following Gaussian processes. We applied our model to the monkeypox data from the UK, sampling the posterior distribution of all parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, to quantify the delay between monkeypox symptom onset to healthcare presentation and the growth rate over the study period. Result(s): Our results suggest that the delay between symptom onset and healthcare presentation for monkeypox in the UK decreased from an average of 22 days in early May 2022 to 10 days by early June and 7 days in August 2022. When we account for these dynamic delays, the time-varying growth rate declined gradually in the UK over the May-September 2022 period. Not accounting for varying time delays would have incorrectly characterized the growth rate by a sharp increase followed by a rapid decline in monkeypox cases. Conclusion(s): Our results highlight the importance of correctly quantifying the delay between symptom onset to healthcare presentation when charactering the epidemic growth of monkeypox in the UK. We show that reducing the delay in accessing healthcare is crucial as shorter delays can prevent onwards transmission, and allows prompt use of antivirals post infection. Hence, our study highlights the importance and need for public health agencies to focus on reducing delays from symptom onset to healthcare presentation early in an outbreak and when tailoring the optimal policy response.},

   abstract = {We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. We find that this combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions significantly reduces the bias and variance of R estimates. Moreover, these properties make EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where several existing methods can become destabilised. As a result, EpiFilter offers improved inference of time-varying transmission patterns that are advantageous for assessing the risk of upcoming waves of infection or the influence of interventions, in real time and at various spatial scales.Copyright: © 2021 Kris V.

   abstract = {statistics, often derived from simplified models of epidemic spread, inform public health policy in real time. The instantaneous reproduction number, Rt , is predominant among these statistics, measuring the average ability of an infection to multiply. However, Rt encodes no temporal information and is sensitive to modelling assumptions. Consequently, some have proposed the epidemic growth rate, rt , that is, the rate of change of the log-transformed case incidence, as a more temporally meaningful and model-agnostic policy guide. We examine this assertion, identifying if and when estimates of rt are more informative than those of Rt . We assess their relative strengths both for learning about pathogen transmission mechanisms and for guiding public health interventions in real time. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {With rapid transmission, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to over three million deaths worldwide, posing significant societal challenges. Understanding the spatial patterns of patient visits and detecting local cluster centers are crucial to controlling disease outbreaks. We analyze COVID-19 contact tracing data collected from Seoul, which provide a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of patient visit occurrence. Analyzing contact tracing data is challenging because patient visits show strong clustering patterns, while cluster centers may have complex interaction behavior. Cluster centers attract each other at mid-range distances because other cluster centers are likely to appear in nearby regions. At the same time, they repel each other at too small distances to avoid merging. To account for such behaviors, we develop a novel interaction Neyman-Scott process that regards the observed patient visit events as offsprings generated from a parent cluster center. Inference for such models is challenging since the likelihood involves intractable normalizing functions. To address this issue, we embed an auxiliary variable algorithm into our Markov chain Monte Carlo. We fit our model to several simulated and real data examples under different outbreak scenarios and show that our method can describe the spatial patterns of patient visits well. We also provide useful visualizations that can inform public health interventions for infectious diseases, such as social distancing. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   volume = {190},
   number = {6},
   pages = {1081-1087},
   abstract = {It is of critical importance to estimate changing disease-transmission rates and their dependence on population mobility. A common approach to this problem involves fitting daily transmission rates using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-(SEIR) model (regularizing to avoid overfitting) and then computing the relationship between the estimated transmission rate and mobility. Unfortunately, there are often several very different transmission-rate trajectories that can fit the reported cases well, meaning that the choice of regularization determines the final solution (and thus the mobility-transmission rate relationship) selected by the SEIR model. Moreover, the classical approaches to regularization - penalizing the derivative of the transmission rate trajectory - do not correspond to realistic properties of pandemic spread. Consequently, models fitted using derivative-based regularization are often biased toward underestimating the current transmission rate and future deaths. In this work, we propose mobility-driven regularization of the SEIR transmission rate trajectory. This method rectifies the artificial regularization problem, produces more accurate and unbiased forecasts of future deaths, and estimates a highly interpretable relationship between mobility and the transmission rate. For this analysis, mobility data related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was collected by Safegraph (San Francisco, California) from major US cities between March and August 2020.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   journal = {International Journal for Quality in Health Care},
   volume = {33},

   pages = {mzab151},
   abstract = {Objective: As the globe endures the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we developed a hybrid Shewhart chart to visualize and learn from day-to-day variation in a variety of epidemic measures over time. Context: Countries and localities have reported daily data representing the progression of COVID-19 conditions and measures, with trajectories mapping along the classic epidemiological curve. Settings have experienced different patterns over time within the epidemic: pre-exponential growth, exponential growth, plateau or descent and/ or low counts after descent. Decision-makers need a reliable method for rapidly detecting transitions in epidemic measures, informing curtailment strategies and learning from actions taken. Method(s): We designed a hybrid Shewhart chart describing four 'epochs' ((i) pre-exponential growth, (ii) exponential growth, (iii) plateau or descent and (iv) stability after descent) of the COVID-19 epidemic that emerged by incorporating a C-chart and I-chart with a log-regression slope. We developed and tested the hybrid chart using international data at the country, regional and local levels with measures including cases, hospitalizations and deaths with guidance from local subject-matter experts. Result(s): The hybrid chart effectively and rapidly signaled the occurrence of each of the four epochs. In the UK, a signal that COVID-19 deaths moved into exponential growth occurred on 17 September, 44 days prior to the announcement of a large-scale lockdown. In California, USA, signals detecting increases in COVID-19 cases at the county level were detected in December 2020 prior to statewide stay-at-home orders, with declines detected in the weeks following. In Ireland, in December 2020, the hybrid chart detected increases in COVID-19 cases, followed by hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths. Following national restrictions in late December, a similar sequence of reductions in the measures was detected in January and February 2021. Conclusion(s): The Shewhart hybrid chart is a valuable tool for rapidly generating learning from data in close to real time. When used by subject-matter experts, the chart can guide actionable policy and local decision-making earlier than when action is likely to be taken without it.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine whether pandemic exposure impacted unmet social and diabetes needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in a sample with diabetes and poor glycemic control. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants with diabetes and poor glycemic control in an ongoing trial (n = 353). We compared the prevalence of unmet needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in successive cohorts of enrollees surveyed pre-pandemic (prior to March 11, 2020, n = 182), in the early stages of the pandemic (May-September, 2020, n = 75), and later (September 2020-January 2021, n = 96) stratified by income and gender. Adjusted multivariable regression models were used to examine trends. Result(s): More participants with low income reported food insecurity (70% vs. 83%, p < 0.05) and needs related to access to blood glucose supplies (19% vs. 67%, p < 0.05) during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. In adjusted models among people with low incomes, the odds of housing insecurity increased among participants during the early pandemic months compared with participants pre-pandemic (OR 20.2 [95% CI 2.8-145.2], p < 0.01). A1c levels were better among participants later in the pandemic than those pre-pandemic (beta = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.4], p < 0.01), but systolic blood pressure control was substantially worse (beta = 11.5 [95% CI 4.2-18.8, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Adults with low-incomes and diabetes were most impacted by the pandemic. A1c may not fully capture challenges that people with diabetes are facing to manage their condition; systolic blood pressures may have worsened and problems with self-care may forebode longer-term challenges in diabetes control.Copyright © 2021 Primary Care Diabetes Europe},

   abstract = {The complexities involved in modelling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has been a roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model-the Blue Sky model-and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic. Copyright © 2021.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: SARS CoV-2 pandemic is pressing hard on the responsiveness of health systems worldwide, notably concerning the massive surge in demand for intensive care hospital beds., AIM: This study proposes a methodology to estimate the saturation moment of hospital intensive care beds (critical care beds) and determine the number of units required to compensate for this saturation., METHODS: A total of 22,016 patients with diagnostic confirmation for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed between March 4 and May 5, 2020, nationwide. Based on information from the Chilean Ministry of Health and ministerial announcements in the media, the overall availability of critical care beds was estimated at 1,900 to 2,000. The Gompertz function was used to estimate the expected number of COVID-19 patients and to assess their exposure to the available supply of intensive care beds in various possible scenarios, taking into account the supply of total critical care beds, the average occupational index, and the demand for COVID-19 patients who would require an intensive care bed., RESULTS: A 100% occupancy of critical care beds could be reached between May 11 and May 27. This condition could be extended for around 48 days, depending on how the expected over-demand is managed., CONCLUSION: A simple, easily interpretable, and applicable to all levels (nationwide, regionwide, municipalities, and hospitals) model is offered as a contribution to managing the expected demand for the coming weeks and helping reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   journal = {eBioMedicine},
   volume = {79},
   pages = {103989},
   abstract = {Background: Assessing relatedness of pathogen sequences in clinical samples is a core goal in molecular epidemiology. Tools for Bayesian analysis of phylogeny, such as the BEAST software package, have been typically used in the analysis of sequence/time data in public health. However, they are computationally-, time-, and knowledge-intensive, demanding resources that many laboratories do not have available or cannot allocate frequently. Method(s): To evaluate a faster and simpler alternative method to support the routine interpretation of sequence data for epidemiology, we obtained sequences for two regions in the measles virus genome, N-450 and MF-NCR, from patient samples of genotypes B3, D4 and D8 taken between 2011 and 2017 in the UK and Romania. A mathematical model incorporating time, possible shared ancestry and the Poisson distribution describing the number of expected substitutions at a given time point was developed to exclude epidemiological relatedness between pairs of sequences. The model was validated against the commonly used Bayesian phylogenetic method using an independent dataset collected in 2017-19. Finding(s): We demonstrate that our model, using time and sequence information to predict whether two samples may be related within a given time frame, minimises the risk of erroneous exclusion of relatedness. An easy-to-use implementation in the form of a guide and spreadsheet is provided for convenient application. Interpretation(s): The proposed model only requires a previously calculated substitution rate for the locus and pathogen of interest. It allows for an informed but quick decision on the likelihood of relatedness between two samples within a time frame, without the need for phylogenetic reconstruction, thus facilitating rapid epidemiological interpretation of sequence data.

   abstract = {Aims: Women face many sources of stress throughout their lives, and some periods are particularly sensitive; pregnancy is one of them. The COVID-19 pandemic is a likely source of additional stress for pregnant women. Moreover, there is evidence that pregnant women have experienced high levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. Our study aimed to evaluate the association of pregnancy-specific stress, pandemic-related stress, and coping strategies with anxiety, depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology in Italian women during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020-June 2021). We also investigated whether there were differences in these levels of psychopathology compared to a prior study conducted during the first pandemic wave (April-August 2020) in Italian pregnant women. Method(s): We assessed 325 pregnant women receiving outpatient prenatal care, using the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS), the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory (NuPCI), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) screening. The main analysis was conducted comparing multiple logistic regression models predicting each psychopathological outcome from specific covariates and NuPDQ, PREPS, and NuPCI scores. Result(s): 42.8% of the sample reported significant levels of anxiety, while 10.3% was positive on depression screening and 13.1% on OCD screening. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of high anxiety, depression, or OCD screening scores compared with the first pandemic wave. Controlling for covariates, we found that GAD-7 and PHQ-2 scores were predicted by pregnancy-specific stress; positive OCD screening was not. The model of high anxiety was improved by adding pandemic-related stress as a predictor (in particular, feeling unprepared for delivery and postpartum). Finally, coping strategies (avoidance, spiritual coping, and planning-preparation) significantly improved prediction of all three psychopathological outcomes. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests the importance of pregnancy-related stress, COVID-19 pandemic stress, and of coping strategies in counteracting or contributing to psychiatric symptomatology during the current pandemic.Copyright © 2022 Penengo, Colli, Cesco, Croccia, Degano, Ferreghini, Garzitto, Lobel, Preis, Sala, Driul and Balestrieri.},

   abstract = {Objectives: We developed COVID-19 Outbreak Simulator (https://ictr.github.io/covid19-outbreak-simulator/) to quantitatively estimate the effectiveness of preventative and interventive measures to prevent and battle COVID-19 outbreaks for specific populations. Material(s) and Method(s): Our simulator simulates the entire course of infection and transmission of the virus among individuals in heterogeneous populations, subject to operations and influences, such as quarantine, testing, social distancing, and community infection. It provides command-line and Jupyter notebook interfaces and a plugin system for user-defined operations. Result(s): The simulator provides quantitative estimates for COVID-19 outbreaks in a variety of scenarios and assists the development of public health policies, risk-reduction operations, and emergency response plans. Discussion(s): Our simulator is powerful, flexible, and customizable, although successful applications require realistic estimation and robustness analysis of population-specific parameters. Conclusion(s): Risk assessment and continuity planning for COVID-19 outbreaks are crucial for the continued operation of many organizations. Our simulator will be continuously expanded to meet this need.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.},

   abstract = {The management of COVID-19 appears to be a long-term challenge, even in countries that have managed to suppress the epidemic after their initial outbreak. In this paper, we propose a model predictive approach for the constrained control of a nonlinear compartmental model that captures the key dynamical properties of COVID-19. The control design uses the discrete-time version of the epidemic model, and it is able to handle complex, possibly time-dependent constraints, logical relations between model variables and multiple predefined discrete levels of interventions. A state observer is also constructed for the computation of non-measured variables from the number of hospitalized patients. Five control scenarios with different cost functions and constraints are studied through numerical simulations, including an output feedback configuration with uncertain parameters. It is visible from the results that, depending on the cost function associated with different policy aims, the obtained controls correspond to mitigation and suppression strategies, and the constructed control inputs are similar to real-life government responses. The results also clearly show the key importance of early intervention, the continuous tracking of the susceptible population and that of future work in determining the true costs of restrictive control measures and their quantitative effects.

   abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) risk management requires efficient surveillance of the infection in wild birds for early warning purposes. In this study, our aim was to describe the spread of continent-wide infection cases using a fireworks model and therefore improve current surveillance systems. The fireworks model is a metaphor illustrating the spread of HPAI as a point source epizootic. The approach is based on early detection of the outbreak seeds (sparks from the fireworks) and uses a predictive model of the probability of the occurrence of new cases following a seed introduction; this then determines the spatiotemporal perimeter for intense surveillance investigations. For a case study, we used surveillance data on HPAI H5N1 in wild birds across Europe between 2005 and 2010 to describe the outbreaks and determine the success of the case detection used to inform management of the disease. The fireworks description assumes simultaneous introductions of 'seeds' of cases, which then 'explode' in local foci but do not merge into a progressive disease wave. This model fits the data well. Using this predictive approach for HPAI cases in EU countries, we found that the investigation radius needed to achieve a detection level of 90% of new cases after an outbreak ranged from 10 km to more than 300 km, depending on the outbreak pattern. Based on these findings, the fireworks approach can be a valuable method for identifying the perimeters and risk areas to be targeted for enhanced surveillance. The rationale of the fireworks approach is quite generic and can easily be adapted to different situations and contexts.Copyright © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

   journal = {Social Science and Medicine},
   volume = {273},

   abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological models have been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, although performance evaluation has been limited. The objective of this work was to thoroughly evaluate a SEIR model used for the short-term (1 to 3 weeks) prediction of cases, quantifying its actual past performance, and its potential performance by optimizing the model parameters., METHODS: Daily case forecasts were obtained for the first wave of cases (July 31, 2020 to March 11, 2021) in the district of General Pueyrredon (Argentina), quantifying the model performance in terms of uncertainty, inaccuracy and imprecision. The evaluation was carried out with the original parameters of the model (used in the forecasts that were published), and also varying different parameters in order to identify optimal values., RESULTS: The analysis of the model performance showed that alternative values of some parameters, and the correction of the input values using a "moving average" filter to eliminate the weekly variations in the case reports, would have yielded better results. The model with the optimized parameters was able to reduce the uncertainty from almost 40% to less than 15%, with similar values of inaccuracy, and with slightly greater imprecision., DISCUSSION: Simple epidemiological models, without large requirements for their implementation, can be very useful for making quick decisions in small cities or cities with limited resources, as long as the importance of their evaluation is taken into account and their scope and limitations are considered.},

   abstract = {By March 2020, COVID-19 led to thousands of deaths and disrupted economic activity worldwide. As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections during its initial invasion of the United States remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the United States through 12 March, we estimated that 108,689 (95% posterior predictive interval [95% PPI]: 1,023 to 14,182,310) infections occurred in the United States by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections with local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between 24 February and 12 March, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.98; 95% PPI: 0.66 to 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the United States. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

   pages = {798},
   abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is a highly transmittable virus. Since the first person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Italy on February 21st, 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 increased rapidly, mainly in northern Italian regions, including Piedmont. A strict lockdown was imposed on March 21st until May 4th when a gradual relaxation of the restrictions started. In this context, computational models and computer simulations are one of the available research tools that epidemiologists can exploit to understand the spread of the diseases and to evaluate social measures to counteract, mitigate or delay the spread of the epidemic. Method(s): This study presents an extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SEIRS) model accounting for population age structure. The infectious population is divided into three sub-groups: (i) undetected infected individuals, (ii) quarantined infected individuals and (iii) hospitalized infected individuals. Moreover, the strength of the government restriction measures and the related population response to these are explicitly represented in the model. Result(s): The proposed model allows us to investigate different scenarios of the COVID-19 spread in Piedmont and the implementation of different infection-control measures and testing approaches. The results show that the implemented control measures have proven effective in containing the epidemic, mitigating the potential dangerous impact of a large proportion of undetected cases. We also forecast the optimal combination of individual-level measures and community surveillance to contain the new wave of COVID-19 spread after the re-opening work and social activities. Conclusion(s): Our model is an effective tool useful to investigate different scenarios and to inform policy makers about the potential impact of different control strategies. This will be crucial in the upcoming months, when very critical decisions about easing control measures will need to be taken.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

   journal = {BioData Mining},
   volume = {16},
   number = {1},
   pages = {22},
   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a parameter identification methodology of the SIRD model, an extension of the classical SIR model, that considers the deceased as a separate category. In addition, our model includes one parameter which is the ratio between the real total number of infected and the number of infected that were documented in the official statistics. Due to many factors, like governmental decisions, several variants circulating, opening and closing of schools, the typical assumption that the parameters of the model stay constant for long periods of time is not realistic. Thus our objective is to create a method which works for short periods of time. In this scope, we approach the estimation relying on the previous 7 days of data and then use the identified parameters to make predictions. To perform the estimation of the parameters we propose the average of an ensemble of neural networks. Each neural network is constructed based on a database built by solving the SIRD for 7 days, with random parameters. In this way, the networks learn the parameters from the solution of the SIRD model. Lastly we use the ensemble to get estimates of the parameters from the real data of Covid19 in Romania and then we illustrate the predictions for different periods of time, from 10 up to 45 days, for the number of deaths. The main goal was to apply this approach on the analysis of COVID-19 evolution in Romania, but this was also exemplified on other countries like Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland with similar results. The results are backed by a theorem which guarantees that we can recover the parameters of the model from the reported data. We believe this methodology can be used as a general tool for dealing with short term predictions of infectious diseases or in other compartmental models.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision-making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics, making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behavior of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant. Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters.

   journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
   volume = {857},
   pages = {159326},
   abstract = {Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has been widely used as a public health tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, epidemiological inference from WBS data remains understudied and limits its application. In this study, we have established a quantitative framework to estimate COVID-19 prevalence and predict SARS-CoV-2 transmission through integrating WBS data into an SEIR-V model. We conceptually divide the individual-level viral shedding course into exposed, infectious, and recovery phases as an analogy to the compartments in a population-level SEIR model. We demonstrated that the effect of temperature on viral losses in the sewer can be straightforwardly incorporated in our framework. Using WBS data from the second wave of the pandemic (Oct 02, 2020-Jan 25, 2021) in the Greater Boston area, we showed that the SEIR-V model successfully recapitulates the temporal dynamics of viral load in wastewater and predicts the true number of cases peaked earlier and higher than the number of reported cases by 6-16 days and 8.3-10.2 folds (R = 0.93). This work showcases a simple yet effective method to bridge WBS and quantitative epidemiological modeling to estimate the prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the sewershed, which could facilitate the application of wastewater surveillance of infectious diseases for epidemiological inference and inform public health actions.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {Wastewater surveillance has proved to be a valuable tool to track the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies using wastewater surveillance data revolve around establishing correlations and lead time relative to reported case data. In this perspective, we advocate for the integration of wastewater surveillance data with dynamic within-host and between-host models to better understand, monitor, and predict viral disease outbreaks. Dynamic models overcome emblematic difficulties of using wastewater surveillance data such as establishing the temporal viral shedding profile. Complementarily, wastewater surveillance data bypasses the issues of time lag and underreporting in clinical case report data, thus enhancing the utility and applicability of dynamic models. The integration of wastewater surveillance data with dynamic models can enhance real-time tracking and prevalence estimation, forecast viral transmission and intervention effectiveness, and most importantly, provide a mechanistic understanding of infectious disease dynamics and the driving factors. Dynamic modeling of wastewater surveillance data will advance the development of a predictive and responsive monitoring system to improve pandemic preparedness and population health.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Due to the recent evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts to analyse models for understanding the present situation and for predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a forced Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-RecoveredDead (fSEIRD) differential model for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile (Italian Civil Protection Department) from 24/02/2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of fSEIRD by proposing two different piecewise time-dependent infection rate functions to fit the current epidemic data affected by progressive movement restriction policies put in place by the Italian government. The proposed models are flexible and can be quickly adapted to monitor various epidemic scenarios. Results on the regions of Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna confirm that the proposed models fit the data very accurately and make reliable predictions.© Copyright: 2020 Loli Piccolomini, Zama.

   journal = {Mathematical Biosciences},
   volume = {351},
   pages = {108885},
   abstract = {Countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with an elimination strategy. This involves a combination of strict border controls with a rapid and effective response to eliminate border-related re-introductions. An important question for decision makers is, when there is a new re-introduction, what is the right threshold at which to implement strict control measures designed to reduce the effective reproduction number below 1. Since it is likely that there will be multiple re-introductions, responding at too low a threshold may mean repeatedly implementing controls unnecessarily for outbreaks that would self-eliminate even without control measures. On the other hand, waiting for too high a threshold to be reached creates a risk that controls will be needed for a longer period of time, or may completely fail to contain the outbreak. Here, we use a highly idealised branching process model of small border-related outbreaks to address this question. We identify important factors that affect the choice of threshold in order to minimise the expect time period for which control measures are in force. We find that the optimal threshold for introducing controls decreases with the effective reproduction number, and increases with overdispersion of the offspring distribution and with the effectiveness of control measures. Our results are not intended as a quantitative decision-making algorithm. However, they may help decision makers understand when a wait-and-see approach is likely to be preferable over an immediate response.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

   title = {The Relationship Between Perceived Stress and Subjective Cognitive Decline During the COVID-19 Epidemic},
   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {12},
   pages = {647971},
   abstract = {During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, fear of disease and its consequences, recommended lifestyle changes, and severe restrictions set by governments acted as stressors and affected people's mood, emotions, mental health, and wellbeing. Many studies conducted during this crisis focused on affective and physiological responses to stress, but few studies examined how the crisis affected cognition. The present cross-sectional study examined the relationship between physiological, affective, and cognitive responses to the epidemic. In an online survey conducted at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in Slovenia (April 15-25, 2020), 830 Slovenian residents aged 18-85 years reported the effects of stressors (confinement, problems at home, problems at work, lack of necessities, and increased workload), experienced emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, changes in health, fatigue and sleep quality, and perceived changes in cognition during the epidemic. Risk factors for stress (neuroticism, vulnerability, general health, gender, and age) were also recorded. We hypothesized that stressors and stress risk factors will be related to subjective cognitive decline, with negative emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, and physical symptoms acting as mediator variables. On average, the results showed a mild subjective cognitive decline during the epidemic. In structural equation modeling, 34% of its variance was predicted by the mediator variables, with negative emotions and physical symptoms having the largest contribution. Stress risk factors were predictably related to the four mediator variables. Among the stressors, confinement showed the strongest effect on the four mediator variables, implying the importance of thoughtful communication about necessary restrictive measures during emergency circumstances. The results of this study indicate that the possibility of altered cognitive function should be considered when planning work and study activities during the epidemic.

Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the twelve continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include, Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to accurate and timely predictions.},

   journal = {Journal of Theoretical Biology},
   volume = {467},
   pages = {111-122},
   abstract = {Mathematical modelers have attempted to capture the dynamics of Ebola transmission and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, as well as to make predictions about ongoing outbreaks. Many of their models consider only infections with typical symptoms, but Ebola presents clinically in a more complicated way. Even the most common symptom, fever, is not experienced by 13% of patients. This suggests that infected individuals could be asymptomatic or have moderately symptomatic infections as reported during previous Ebola outbreaks. To account crudely for the spectrum of clinical symptoms that characterizes Ebola infection, we developed a model including moderate and severe symptoms. Our model captures the dynamics of the recent outbreak of Ebola in Liberia. Our estimate of the basic reproduction number is 1.83 (CI: 1.72, 1.86), consistent with the WHO response team's estimate using early outbreak case data. We also estimate the effectiveness of interventions using observations before and after their introduction. As the final epidemic size is linked to the timing of interventions in an exponential fashion, a simple empirical formula is provided to guide policy-making. It suggests that early implementation could significantly decrease final size. We also compare our model to one with typical symptoms by excluding moderate ones. The model with only typical symptoms overestimates the basic reproduction number and effectiveness of control measures, and exaggerates changes in peak size attributable to the timing of interventions. In addition, uncertainty about how moderate symptoms affect the basic reproduction number is considered, and PRCC (Partial rank correlation coefficient) is used to analyze the global sensitivity of relevant parameters. Possible control strategies are evaluated through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, indicating that simultaneously strengthening contact-tracing and effectiveness of isolation in hospital would be most effective. In this study, we show that asymptomatic Ebola infections may have implications for policy-making.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This prevention implies an effective system of epidemiological surveillance and the application of timely and effective control measures. This research focuses on the application of techniques for modelling and geovisualizati-on of epidemic data with the aim of simple and fast communication of analytical results via geoportal. Methods The paper describes the approach applied through the project of establishing the epidemiological location-intelligence system for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results Epidemic data were processed and the results related to spatio-temporal analysis of the infection spread were presented by compartmental epidemic model, reproduction number R, epi-cu-rve diagrams as well as choropleth maps for different levels of administrative units. Geovisualization of epidemic data enabled the release of numerous information from described models and indicators, providing easier visual communication of the spread of the disease and better recognition of its trend. Conclusion The approach involves the simultaneous application of epidemic models and epidemic data geovisualization, which allows a simple and rapid evaluation of the epidemic situation and the effects of control measures. This contributes to more infor-mative decision-making related to control measures by suggesting their selective application at the local level.Copyright © 2020, Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton.

   journal = {Microbial Genomics},
   volume = {9},

   pages = {001099},
   abstract = {Inferring the spatiotemporal spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via Bayesian phylogeography has been complicated by the overwhelming sampling bias present in the global genomic dataset. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of metadata in addressing this bias. Specifically, the inclusion of recent travel history of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals into extended phylogeographical models has demonstrated increased accuracy of estimates, along with proposing alternative hypotheses that were not apparent using only genomic and geographical data. However, as the availability of comprehensive epidemiological metadata is limited, many of the current estimates rely on sequence data and basic metadata (i.e. sample date and location). As the bias within the SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset is extensive, the degree to which we can rely on results drawn from standard phylogeographical models (i.e. discrete trait analysis) that lack integrated metadata is of great concern. This is particularly important when estimates influence and inform public health policy. We compared results generated from the same dataset, using two discrete phylogeographical models: one including travel history metadata and one without. We utilized sequences from Victoria, Australia, in this case study for two unique properties. Firstly, the high proportion of cases sequenced throughout 2020 within Victoria and the rest of Australia. Secondly, individual travel history was collected from returning travellers in Victoria during the first wave (January to May) of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We found that the implementation of individual travel history was essential for the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 movement via discrete phylogeography models. Without the additional information provided by the travel history metadata, the discrete trait analysis could not be fit to the data due to numerical instability. We also suggest that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the primary driving force behind the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was viral importation from international locations. This case study demonstrates the necessity of robust genomic datasets supplemented with epidemiological metadata for generating accurate estimates from phylogeographical models in datasets that have significant sampling bias. For future work, we recommend the collection of metadata in conjunction with genomic data. Furthermore, we highlight the risk of applying phylogeographical models to biased datasets without incorporating appropriate metadata, especially when estimates influence public health policy decision making.Copyright © 2023 Crown.},

   pages = {411},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in its first wave, European governments have implemented successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR), the mean number of daily contacts for an infectious individual to transmit the virus, among European citizens evolved during this wave over the period with implemented measures, disregarding a priori information on governmental measures. METHOD(S): We developed a data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily total number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model. We then compared change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures. RESULT(S): The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0.29), Spain (0.24), and Germany (0.27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0.34), Belgium (0.35) and the UK (0.37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0.45). CONCLUSION(S): There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nurses experience loneliness, anxiety, fear, fatigue, sleep disorders, and other physical and mental health problems due to their close contact with patients in cases of epidemic diseases. Among nurses in Turkey, we want to explore how anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation affect nurses' quality of life. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (COVID-19 EQLS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2), psychological health, and social isolation among nurses. It also aimed to identify whether the influence of trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation are stronger than the direct influence of state anxiety on nurses' quality of life during the pandemic. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study design and STROBE guidelines were implemented. In this study, 638 nurses in Turkey were included using simple random sampling. The participants completed the STAI-1 and STAI-2 and COVID-19 EQLS online-form. The parallel-serial mediation model was used to examine the relationships between the determined variables. RESULT(S): Psychological health, psychological effects of social isolation, and trait anxiety fully mediated the relationship between state anxiety and quality of life of nurses. The total indirect effect of the confidence interval of bootstrapping was statistically different from zero. CONCLUSION(S): Trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation were the main factors with statistically significant indirect effects on the quality of life of Turkish nurses in this study.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease, impacting multiple organs in the human body. But COVID-19 also impacts other diseases of relevance to public and planetary health. To understand and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we need an intersectional conceptual lens and systems thinking. For example, the strain on health care systems due to COVID-19 has adversely impacted global malaria elimination programs. With many epidemiological, clinical, and biological parallels documented, we examined in this study the scenario of malaria and COVID-19 syndemic in India. The disruptive influence of COVID-19 on the National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME), impact of unintended chemoprophylaxis, population genetic influences, and the shifting patterns of epidemiology are compared. Importantly, a time series analysis forecasted the burden of malaria increasing in the upcoming years. Although reported malaria cases showed a decline in 2020 compared to the previous years, an increase in cases was documented in 2021, with nine states reporting an increase up to July 2021. Pandemics often cause crosscutting disruptions in health care. Reshaping the priorities of the malaria elimination program and a diligent implementation of the priorities in the NFME would, therefore, be well-advised: (1) vector control, (2) antimalarial therapy recommendations, (3) monitoring drug resistance, (4) prevention of the spread of asymptomatic disease-causing low-density transmission, and (5) large-scale testing measures. In conclusion, the findings from the present study inform future comparative studies in other world regions to better understand the broader, systemic, temporal, and spatial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing and future diseases across public health systems and services.© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.},

The results, based on the application of a Boosted Regression Tree algorithm method, show that average temperature and average relative humidity explain significant variations in COVID-19 transmission across temperate and subtropical regions, whereas in the tropical region, the average diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality significantly predict the infection outbreak. The number of positive cases showed a decrease sharply above an average temperature of 10degreeC in the cities of France, Turkey, the US, the UK, and Germany. Among the tropical countries, COVID-19 in Indian cities is most affected by mean diurnal temperature, and those in Brazil by temperature seasonality. The findings have implications on public health interventions, and contribute to the ongoing scientific and policy discourse on the complex interplay of climatic factors determining the risks of COVID-19 transmission.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {Public health decision makers rely on hospitalization forecasts to inform COVID-19 pandemic planning and resource allocation. Hospitalization forecasts are most relevant when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently. We rapidly adapted an agent-based model (ABM) to provide weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts (i.e., demand for intensive care unit [ICU] beds and non-ICU beds) by state and region in North Carolina for public health decision makers. The ABM was based on a synthetic population of North Carolina residents and included movement of agents (i.e., patients) among North Carolina hospitals, nursing homes, and the community. We assigned SARS-CoV-2 infection to agents using county-level compartmental models and determined agents' COVID-19 severity and probability of hospitalization using synthetic population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities). We generated weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts during May-December 2020 and evaluated the impact of major model updates on statewide forecast accuracy under a SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction number range of 1.0-1.2. Of the 21 forecasts included in the assessment, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.8% for non-ICU beds and 23.6% for ICU beds. Among the major model updates, integration of near-real-time hospital occupancy data into the model had the largest impact on improving forecast accuracy, reducing the average MAPE for non-ICU beds from 6.6% to 3.9% and for ICU beds from 33.4% to 6.5%. Our results suggest that future pandemic hospitalization forecasting efforts should prioritize early inclusion of hospital occupancy data to maximize accuracy.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.Copyright © 2021 Prem et al.

   abstract = {In this study, we developed and analyzed a mathematical model for explaining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. The proposed SIu Ik R model is a modified version of the existing SIR model. Our model divides the infected class I of SIR model into two classes: Iu (unknown infected class) and Ik (known infected class). In addition, we consider R a recovered and reserved class, where susceptible people can hide them due to fear of the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, a non-monotonic incidence function is deemed to incorporate the psychological effect of the novel coronavirus diseases on India's community. The epidemiological threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, has been formulated and presented graphically. With this threshold parameter, the local and global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic proportion equilibrium based on disease persistence have been analyzed. Lastly, numerical results of long-run prediction using MATLAB show that the fate of this situation is very harmful if people are not following the guidelines issued by the authority.

   journal = {Aging & mental health},
   volume = {28},
   number = {1},
   pages = {103-111},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Older carers play a vital role supporting population health and protecting health and social care systems, yet there has been little research on understanding the effect of the pandemic on this group. In this paper, we investigate caring as a factor contributing to mental and self-rated health. METHOD(S): We investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between provision of family care and mental health and wellbeing using longitudinal data from 5,149 members of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who responded to Wave 9 (2018/2019) and two COVID-19 sub-studies (June/July 2020; November/December 2020). We use logistic or linear regression models depending on outcome measures, controlling for pre-pandemic socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related variables. RESULT(S): Before the pandemic, 21% of respondents cared for family or friends. Older people caring for someone inside the household mostly continued to provide care during the pandemic, with more than a quarter reporting an increase in the amount of care provided. Co-resident carers were disproportionately female, older, in the lowest wealth quintile, and more likely to report disability and chronic conditions. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses suggest that, compared to those caring for people living outside the household, co-resident carers were significantly more likely to report poorer mental health and self-rated health. CONCLUSION(S): The health of older carers worsened disproportionately in the first year of the pandemic, a period also characterised by disruptions to support and closure of respite services. Support for carers' mental and physical health requires greater policy attention, especially in pandemic conditions.},

   journal = {PLoS ONE},

   number = {2 February},
   pages = {e0263367},
   abstract = {This work presents a tool for forecasting the spread of the new coronavirus in Mexico City, which is based on a mathematical model with a metapopulation structure that uses Bayesian statistics and is inspired by a data-driven approach. The daily mobility of people in Mexico City is mathematically represented by an origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and the Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between 27 February 2020 and 27 October 2020, while using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Given that working with metapopulation models leads to rather high computational time consumption, and parameter estimation of these models may lead to high memory RAM consumption, we do a clustering analysis that is based on mobility trends to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all of the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis can be implemented in smaller or larger scales in different parts of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided into the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict individual movement in the city. We also calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters obtaining that this threshold is in the interval (1.2713, 1.3054). Our analysis of mobility trends can be helpful when making public health decisions.Copyright © 2022 Prieto et al.

   abstract = {Background: A universal HIV testing-and-treatment (UTT) approach has been shown to be effective as an intervention in high prevalence areas in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to reduce HIV incidence. Community-wide interventions may change the dynamics of the epidemic. Understanding these changes will inform future policy towards achieving zero new infections. Using an individualbased model (PopART-IBM), developed as part of the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, we project the impact of four scenarios of UTT to 2030 on the distribution of incident cases stratified by categories of sexual risk-taking behaviour. Method(s): Model predictions were made with the PopART-IBM calibrated to data from a representative trial community in Zambia from the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial. The model has been previously validated against the primary endpoint of the trial. The model separates the population into three groups according to sexual risk-taking behaviour based on behavioural questionnaire data, including number of sex partners and use of condoms. The proportions of individuals in each risk group (low 50%, medium 35%, high 15%) were assumed to be static through time. Model projections to 2030 are based on four scenarios: 1) PopART then continuation of UTT in the PopART community; 2) PopART then no UTT; 3) no PopART but nationwide UTT from 2020; 4) no PopART and no UTT. Result(s): Making antiretroviral therapy universally accessible to all who are HIVpositive in the PopART community would lead to a decline in prevalence in all risk groups but would concentrate new cases in those with the highest levels of risk-taking behaviour (65% of incident cases vs 54% if no UTT was implemented; figure 1). While population HIV incidence to 2030 decreases, the model predicts continued persistence of an HIV epidemic in the high-risk subpopulation in all scenarios unless nationwide UTT is adopted. Conclusion(s): Our results predict that even with a UTT intervention, the proportion and absolute number of new HIV cases in those with the highest levels of sexual risk-taking behaviour would increase, despite overall HIV prevalence decreasing. Our results highlight that targeting of high-risk individuals may be necessary following successful UTT interventions in order to eliminate HIV as a public health issue in SSA.},

   abstract = {Background: The long-term impact of universal home-based testing and treatment as part of universal testing and treatment (UTT) on HIV incidence is unknown. We made projections using a detailed individual-based model of the effect of the intervention delivered in the HPTN 071 (PopART) cluster-randomised trial. Method(s): In this modelling study, we fitted an individual-based model to the HIV epidemic and HIV care cascade in 21 high prevalence communities in Zambia and South Africa that were part of the PopART cluster-randomised trial (intervention period Nov 1, 2013, to Dec 31, 2017). The model represents coverage of home-based testing and counselling by age and sex, delivered as part of the trial, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, and any changes in national guidelines on ART eligibility. In PopART, communities were randomly assigned to one of three arms: arm A received the full PopART intervention for all individuals who tested positive for HIV, arm B received the intervention with ART provided in accordance with national guidelines, and arm C received standard of care. We fitted the model to trial data twice using Approximate Bayesian Computation, once before data unblinding and then again after data unblinding. We compared projections of intervention impact with observed effects, and for four different scenarios of UTT up to Jan 1, 2030 in the study communities. Finding(s): Compared with standard of care, a 51% (95% credible interval 40-60) reduction in HIV incidence is projected if the trial intervention (arms A and B combined) is continued from 2020 to 2030, over and above a declining trend in HIV incidence under standard of care. Interpretation(s): A widespread and continued commitment to UTT via home-based testing and counselling can have a substantial effect on HIV incidence in high prevalence communities.

   abstract = {The ongoing pandemic scenario, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a considerable impact on public health all over the world. Italy was one of the most affected countries, as the first European full-blown outbreak occurred there. The exposure of the Italian health care workers to COVID-19 may be an important risk factor for psychological distress. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe worries and risk perception of being infected among Italian Health Care Workers (HCWs) during the first wave of the pandemic. In total, 2078 HCWs participated in a web survey (78.8% were females). The highest percentage of respondents were physicians (40.75%) and nurses (32.15%), followed by medical (18.00%), health care support (4.50%) and administrative (4.60%) staff. In a score range between 0 (not worried) and 4 (very worried), our results showed that participants declared that they were worried about the Coronavirus infection with a median score of 3 (IQR 2-3) and for 59.19% the risk perception of being infected was very high. In addition, HCWs reported they suffered from sleep disturbances (63.43%). From the analysis of the psychological aspect, a possible divergence emerged between the perceived need for psychological support (83.85%) and the relative lack of this service among health care providers emerged (9.38%). Our findings highlight the importance of psychological and psychiatric support services not only during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in other emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) scenarios. These services may be useful for health authorities and policymakers to ensure the psychological well-being of health care professionals and to promote precautionary behaviors among them.},

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   title = {Impacts of timing, length, and intensity of behavioral interventions to COVID-19 dynamics: North Carolina county-level examples},
   journal = {Infectious Disease Modelling},
   volume = {7},
   number = {3},
   pages = {535-544},
   abstract = {We sought to examine how the impact of revocable behavioral interventions, e.g., shelter-in-place, varies throughout an epidemic, as well as the role that the proportion of susceptible individuals had on an intervention's impact. We estimated the theoretical impacts of start day, length, and intensity of interventions on disease transmission and illustrated them on COVID-19 dynamics in Wake County, North Carolina, to inform how interventions can be most effective. We used a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate epidemic curves with modifications to the disease transmission parameter (beta). We designed modifications to simulate events likely to increase transmission (e.g., long weekends, holiday seasons) or behavioral interventions likely to decrease it (e.g., shelter-in-place, masking). We compared the resultant curves' shape, timing, and cumulative case count to baseline and across other modified curves. Interventions led to changes in COVID-19 dynamics, including moving the peak's location, height, and width. The proportion susceptible, at the start day, strongly influenced their impact. Early interventions shifted the curve, while interventions near the peak modified shape and case count. For some scenarios, in which the transmission parameter was decreased, the final cumulative count increased over baseline. We showed that the timing of revocable interventions has a strong impact on their effect. The same intervention applied at different time points, corresponding to different proportions of susceptibility, resulted in qualitatively differential effects. Accurate estimation of the proportion susceptible is critical for understanding an intervention's impact. The findings presented here provide evidence of the importance of estimating the proportion of the population that is susceptible when predicting the impact of behavioral infection control interventions. Greater emphasis should be placed on the estimation of this epidemic component in intervention design and decision-making. Our results are generic and are applicable to other infectious disease epidemics, as well as to future waves of the current COVID-19 epidemic. Developed into a publicly available tool that allows users to modify the parameters to estimate impacts of different interventions, these models could aid in evaluating behavioral intervention options prior to their use and in predicting case increases from specific events.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the responsible virus for the Covid-19 epidemic, has sparked a global health concern with many countries affected. Developing models that can interpret the epidemic and give common trend parameters are useful for prediction purposes by other countries that are at an earlier phase of the epidemic; it is also useful for future planning against viral respiratory diseases. One model is developed to interpret the fast-growth phase of the epidemic and another model for an interpretation of the entire data set. Both models agree reasonably with the data. It is shown by the first model that during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases depends on the total number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82. The second model gives a duplication time in the range 1-3 days early in the start of the epidemic, and another parameter (alpha = 0.1-0.5) that deviates the progress of the epidemic from an exponential growth. Our models may be used for data interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g., the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases., GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: Copyright © Societa Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.},

   abstract = {The new Coronavirus Disease 19, officially known as COVID-19, originated in China in 2019 and has since spread worldwide. We presented an age-structured Susceptible-Latent-Mild-Critical-Removed (SLMCR) compartmental model of COVID-19 disease transmission with nonlinear incidence during the pandemic period. We provided the model calibration to estimate parameters with day-wise COVID-19 data, i.e., reported cases by worldometer from 15th February to 30th March 2020 in six high-burden countries, including Australia, Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK, and Canada. We estimate transmission rates for each country and found that the country with the highest transmission rate is Spain, which may increase the new cases and deaths than the other countries. We found that saturation infection negatively impacted the dynamics of COVID-19 cases in all the six high-burden countries. The study used a sensitivity analysis to identify the most critical parameters through the partial rank correlation coefficient method. We found that the transmission rate of COVID-19 had the most significant influence on prevalence. The prediction of new cases in COVID-19 until 30th April 2020 using the developed model was also provided with recommendations to control strategies of COVID-19. We also found that adults are more susceptible to infection than both children and older people in all six countries. However, in Italy, Spain, the UK, and Canada, older people show more susceptibility to infection than children, opposite to the case in Australia and the USA. The information generated from this study would be helpful to the decision-makers of various organisations across the world, including the Ministry of Health in Australia, Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK, and Canada, to control COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Azizur Rahman and Md Abdul Kuddus.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is an unprecedented shock throughout the world, which has generated a massive social, human, and economic crisis. Identification of risk factors is crucial to prevent the COVID-19 spread by taking appropriate countermeasures effectively. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the potential risk factors contributing to the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh., METHOD: Spatial regression methods were applied in this study to fulfill the aim. Data related to 28 demographic, economic, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected from secondary sources and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) regression models were developed in this study., RESULTS: The results of the models identified four factors: percentage of the urban population, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital city, as significant risk factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh, with an R 2 value of 78.6%., CONCLUSION: Findings and discussions from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation, which helped discuss policy implications to negotiate the future epidemic crisis. The primary policy response would be to decentralize the urban population and economic activities from and around the capital city, Dhaka, to create self-sufficient regions throughout the country, especially in the north-western region.

   abstract = {The novel COVID-19 is a worldwide transmitted pandemic and has received global attention. Since there is no effective medication yet, to minimize and control the transmission of the COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are followed globally. However, for the implementation of needful NPIs through effective management strategies and planning, space-time-based information on the nature, magnitude, pattern of transmission, hotspots, the potential risk factors, vulnerability, and risk level of the pandemic are important. Hence, this study was an attempt to in-depth assess and analyze the COVID-19 outbreak and transmission dynamics through space and time in Bangladesh using 154 day real-time epidemiological data series. District-level data were analyzed for the geospatial analysis and modelling using GIS. Getis-Ord Gi* statistics was applied for the hotspot analysis, and on the other hand, the analytical hierarchy process-based weighted sum method (AHP-WSM) was used for the modelling of vulnerability zoning of COVID-19. In Bangladesh, the status of the pandemic COVID-19 still is in exposure level. Disease transmitted at a high rate (20.37%), and doubling time of the cases were 11 days (latest week of the study period). The fatality rate was comparatively low (1.3%), and the recovery rate was about 57.50%. Geospatial analysis exhibits the disease propagates from the central parts, and Dhaka was the most exposed district followed by Chattogram, Narayanganj, Cumilla, and Bogra. A single strong clustering pattern in the central part, which spread out mainly to the south-eastern part, was identified as a prime hotspot in both the cases and deaths distributions. Additionally, potential linkages between the transmission of disease and the selected factors that gear up the spreading of the disease were identified. The central, eastern, and south-eastern parts were recognized as high vulnerable zone, and conversely, the western, south-western, north-western, and north-eastern parts as medium vulnerable zone. The vulnerable zoning exercise made it possible to identify vulnerable areas with the different magnitude that require urgent intervention through proper management and action plan, and accordingly, comprehensive management strategies were anticipated. Thus, this study will be a useful guide towards understanding the space-time-based investigations and vulnerable area delineation of the COVID-19 and assist to formulate an effective management action plan to reduce and control the disease propagation and impacts. By appropriate adjustment of some factors with local relevance, COVID-19 vulnerability zoning derived here can be applied to other regions, and generally can be used for any other infectious disease. This method was applied at a regional scale, but the availability of larger scale data of the determining factors could be applied in small areas too, and accordingly, management strategies can be formulated.

   title = {Assessing the effects of data drift on the performance of machine learning models used in clinical sepsis prediction},
   journal = {International Journal of Medical Informatics},
   volume = {173},
   pages = {104930},
   abstract = {Background: Data drift can negatively impact the performance of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) that were trained on historical data. As such, MLAs should be continuously monitored and tuned to overcome the systematic changes that occur in the distribution of data. In this paper, we study the extent of data drift and provide insights about its characteristics for sepsis onset prediction. This study will help elucidate the nature of data drift for prediction of sepsis and similar diseases. This may aid with the development of more effective patient monitoring systems that can stratify risk for dynamic disease states in hospitals. Method(s): We devise a series of simulations that measure the effects of data drift in patients with sepsis, using electronic health records (EHR). We simulate multiple scenarios in which data drift may occur, namely the change in the distribution of the predictor variables (covariate shift), the change in the statistical relationship between the predictors and the target (concept shift), and the occurrence of a major healthcare event (major event) such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We measure the impact of data drift on model performances, identify the circumstances that necessitate model retraining, and compare the effects of different retraining methodologies and model architecture on the outcomes. We present the results for two different MLAs, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Result(s): Our results show that the properly retrained XGB models outperform the baseline models in all simulation scenarios, hence signifying the existence of data drift. In the major event scenario, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) at the end of the simulation period is 0.811 for the baseline XGB model and 0.868 for the retrained XGB model. In the covariate shift scenario, the AUROC at the end of the simulation period for the baseline and retrained XGB models is 0.853 and 0.874 respectively. In the concept shift scenario and under the mixed labeling method, the retrained XGB models perform worse than the baseline model for most simulation steps. However, under the full relabeling method, the AUROC at the end of the simulation period for the baseline and retrained XGB models is 0.852 and 0.877 respectively. The results for the RNN models were mixed, suggesting that retraining based on a fixed network architecture may be inadequate for an RNN. We also present the results in the form of other performance metrics such as the ratio of observed to expected probabilities (calibration) and the normalized rate of positive predictive values (PPV) by prevalence, referred to as lift, at a sensitivity of 0.8. Conclusion(s): Our simulations reveal that retraining periods of a couple of months or using several thousand patients are likely to be adequate to monitor machine learning models that predict sepsis. This indicates that a machine learning system for sepsis prediction will probably need less infrastructure for performance monitoring and retraining compared to other applications in which data drift is more frequent and continuous. Our results also show that in the event of a concept shift, a full overhaul of the sepsis prediction model may be necessary because it indicates a discrete change in the definition of sepsis labels, and mixing the labels for the sake of incremental training may not produce the desired results.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {Objectives: Public health officials need tools to assist in anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions. Method(s): The tool uses an SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic's local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. Result(s): Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at six to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. Conclusion(s): Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to forecast the range of increase in COVID-19 infected cases in future days and we present a novel method to compute equidimensional representations of multivariate time series and multivariate spatial time series data. Using this novel method, the proposed model can both take in a large number of heterogeneous features, such as census data, intra-county mobility, inter-county mobility, social distancing data, past growth of infection, among others, and learn complex interactions between these features. Using data collected from various sources, we estimate the range of increase in infected cases seven days into the future for all U.S. counties. In addition, we use the model to identify the most influential features for prediction of the growth of infection. We also analyze pairs of features and estimate the amount of observed second-order interaction between them. Experiments show that the proposed model obtains satisfactory predictive performance and fairly interpretable feature analysis results; hence, the proposed model could complement the standard epidemiological models for national-level surveillance of pandemics, such as COVID-19. The results and findings obtained from the deep learning model could potentially inform policymakers and researchers in devising effective mitigation and response strategies. To fast-track further development and experimentation, the code used to implement the proposed model has been made fully open source.

   title = {Spatial analysis of COVID-19 spread in Iran: Insights into geographical and structural transmission determinants at a province level},
   journal = {PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases},
   volume = {14},
   number = {11},
   pages = {1-15},
   abstract = {The Islamic Republic of Iran reported its first COVID-19 cases by 19th February 2020, since then it has become one of the most affected countries, with more than 73,000 cases and 4,585 deaths to this date. Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province- level in Iran. Therefore, in the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how socioeconomic and climatic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. The analyses are applied to cumulative cases of the disease from February 19th to March 18th. They correspond to obtaining maps associated with quartiles for rates of COVID-19 cases smoothed through a Bayesian technique and relative risks, the calculation of global (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), both univariate and bivariate, to derive significant clustering, and the fit of a multivariate spatial lag model considering a set of variables potentially affecting the presence of the disease. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran (p-value< 0.05), indicating that the COVID-19 spread within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases (p-value < 0.05). Interestingly, literacy is a factor that is associated with a decrease in the number of cases (p-value < 0.05), which might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be useful to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread in Iran. One limitation of our analysis is that the most updated information we found concerning socioeconomic and climatic features is not for 2020, or even for a same year, so that the obtained associations should be interpreted with caution. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within Iran. Iran was among the first countries reporting a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Spatial epidemiology is useful to study the spatial distribution of a disease and to identify factors associated with the number of cases of such disease. By applying these methods, we aimed to identify whether there are clusters of regions in Iran with high or low number of COVID-19 cases and the association of different factors with these numbers, considering spatial relationships and maps representing these associations. Interestingly, we found regions of high number of cases and that more COVID-19 cases were present in provinces with more urbanization, aging population, number of physicians, efficient communications, and greater average temperatures, whereas less COVID-19 cases were present in provinces with more literacy. This study allowed us to understand the spatial behavior of the disease and the importance of having adequate health policies, literacy campaigns, and disseminating health information to the population.Copyright © 2020 Ramirez-Aldana et al.},

The objective of this work was to look for if the socio-economic conditions and the policy of budgetary expenditure followed by the different Spanish autonomous communities have incidence, by themselves, on the mortality rate caused by the SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Econometric research based on Multiple Linear Regression to determine the direct cause-effect relationship between the dependent variable, mortality associated with COVID-19, with explanatory variables of the health budget and socio-economic type., RESULTS: The number of deaths caused by COVID-19 has a positive relationship with the rate of GDP per capita and inversely with expenditure on hospital and specialized services, teaching and IRMs and with the resources allocated to health over the last nine years. A reduction in any of these health budget variables leads to an increase in mortality caused by COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 mortality rate has hit the wealthiest autonomous communities hardest but, above all, has hit those that, although richer, applied more restrictive budgetary measures in the period 2010-2018.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous restrictions in daily life that had a significant impact on the well-being and mental health of the population. Among others, children and adolescents were particularly affected, being a vulnerable group at risk. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional situation of children and adolescents during different phases of the pandemic and to identify modifying factors. Data from the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) survey in Germany were used for this study. The survey waves 12 (19th/20th May 2020) and 21 (15th/16th September 2020) were investigated as examples of two different pandemic phases. The psychosocial and emotional situation and well-being of children were measured with the emotional subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed by parents. Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were calculated. In total, a third of the participating parents in wave 12 and in wave 21 reported having children and adolescents with emotional symptoms. Especially children with younger parents seemed to be more affected by emotional symptoms. Sociodemographic aspects, such as household language, showed a significant association with reported emotional symptoms in children (Wave 12: OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.20-4.09). Reported prevalences of emotional symptoms in children did not differ between the pandemic phases. In conclusion, the pandemic had negative influences on the emotional symptoms of children and adolescents in COVID-19 pandemic waves in 2020, indicating a forecasted reoccurrence and need for preventive measures for upcoming waves and other pandemics in the future.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {The U.S. COVID-19 Forecast Hub aggregates forecasts of the short-term burden of COVID-19 in the United States from many contributing teams. We study methods for building an ensemble that combines forecasts from these teams. These experiments have informed the ensemble methods used by the Hub. To be most useful to policymakers, ensemble forecasts must have stable performance in the presence of two key characteristics of the component forecasts: (1) occasional misalignment with the reported data, and (2) instability in the relative performance of component forecasters over time. Our results indicate that in the presence of these challenges, an untrained and robust approach to ensembling using an equally weighted median of all component forecasts is a good choice to support public health decision-makers. In settings where some contributing forecasters have a stable record of good performance, trained ensembles that give those forecasters higher weight can also be helpful.

   abstract = {Objective: Identify determinants of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel's willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. Background(s): Little is known about the willingness of EMS personnel to work during a future influenza pandemic or the extent to which they are receiving pandemic training. Method(s): EMS personnel were surveyed in July 2018 - Feb 2019 using a cross-sectional approach; the survey was available both electronically and on paper. Participants were provided a pandemic scenario and asked about their willingness to respond if requested or required; additional questions assessed their attitudes and beliefs and training received. Chi-square tests assessed differences in attitude/belief questions by willingness to work. Logistic regressions were used to identify significant predictors of response willingness when requested or required, controlling for gender and race. Result(s): 433 individuals completed the survey (response rate = 82.9%). A quarter (26.8%, n=116) received no pandemic training; 14.3% (n=62) participated in a pandemic exercise. Significantly more EMS personnel were willing to work when required versus when only requested (88.2% vs 76.9%, X2 = 164.1, p < .001). Predictors of willingness to work when requested included believing it is their responsibility to work, believing their coworkers were likely to work, receiving prophylaxis for themselves and their family members, and feeling safe working during a pandemic. Discussion(s): Many emergency medical services personnel report lacking training or disaster exercises related to influenza pandemics, and a fair percentage are unwilling to work during a future event. This may limit healthcare surge capacity and could contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Findings from this study indicate that prehospital staff's attitudes and beliefs about pandemics influence their willingness to work. Pre-event training and planning should address these concerns.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has sent millions of people to hospitals worldwide, exhausting on many occasions the capacity of healthcare systems to provide care patients required to survive. Although several epidemiological research works have contributed a variety of models and approaches to anticipate the pandemic spread, very few have tried to translate the output of these models into hospital service requirements, particularly in terms of bed occupancy, a key question for hospital managers. This paper proposes a tool for predicting the current and future occupancy associated with COVID-19 patients of a hospital to help managers make informed decisions to maximize the availability of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ensure adequate access to services for confirmed COVID-19 patients. The proposed tool uses a discrete event simulation approach that uses archetypes (i.e., empirical models of trajectories) extracted from empirical analysis of actual patient trajectories. Archetypes can be fitted to trajectories observed in different regions or to the particularities of current and forthcoming variants using a rather small amount of data. Numerical experiments on realistic instances demonstrate the accuracy of the tool's predictions and illustrate how it can support managers in their daily decisions concerning the system's capacity and ensure patients the access the resources they require.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a high interest in mathematical models describing and predicting the diverse aspects and implications of the virus outbreak. Model results represent an important part of the information base for the decision process on different administrative levels. The Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) initiated a project whose main goal is to predict COVID-19-specific occupation of beds in intensive care units: Steuerungs-Prognose von Intensivmedizinischen COVID-19 Kapazitaten (SPoCK). The incidence of COVID-19 cases is a crucial predictor for this occupation. METHOD(S): We developed a model based on ordinary differential equations for the COVID-19 spread with a time-dependent infection rate described by a spline. Furthermore, the model explicitly accounts for weekday-specific reporting and adjusts for reporting delay. The model is calibrated in a purely data-driven manner by a maximum likelihood approach. Uncertainties are evaluated using the profile likelihood method. The uncertainty about the appropriate modeling assumptions can be accounted for by including and merging results of different modelling approaches. The analysis uses data from Germany describing the COVID-19 spread from early 2020 until March 31st, 2021. RESULT(S): The model is calibrated based on incident cases on a daily basis and provides daily predictions of incident COVID-19 cases for the upcoming three weeks including uncertainty estimates for Germany and its subregions. Derived quantities such as cumulative counts and 7-day incidences with corresponding uncertainties can be computed. The estimation of the time-dependent infection rate leads to an estimated reproduction factor that is oscillating around one. Data-driven estimation of the dark figure purely from incident cases is not feasible. CONCLUSION(S): We successfully implemented a procedure to forecast near future COVID-19 incidences for diverse subregions in Germany which are made available to various decision makers via an interactive web application. Results of the incidence modeling are also used as a predictor for forecasting the need of intensive care units.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   journal = {Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)},
   volume = {11},

   abstract = {In 2020, coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic and it remains prevalent today. A necessity to model the transmission of the virus has emerged as a result of COVID-19's exceedingly contagious characteristics and its rapid propagation throughout the world. Assessing the incidence of infection could enable policymakers to identify measures to halt the pandemic and gauge the required capacity of healthcare centers. Therefore, modeling the susceptibility, exposure, infection, and recovery in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for the adoption of interventions by regulatory authorities. Fundamental factors, such as the infection rate, mortality rate, and recovery rate, must be considered in order to accurately represent the behavior of the pandemic using mathematical models. The difficulty in creating a mathematical model is in identifying the real model variables. Parameters might vary significantly across models, which can result in variations in the simulation results because projections primarily rely on a particular dataset. The purpose of this work was to establish a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model describing the propagation of the COVID-19 outbreak throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The goal of this study was to derive the essential COVID-19 epidemiological factors from actual data. System dynamics modeling and design of experiment approaches were used to determine the most appropriate combination of epidemiological parameters and the influence of COVID-19. This study investigates how epidemiological variables such as seasonal amplitude, social awareness impact, and waning time can be adapted to correctly estimate COVID-19 scenarios such as the number of infected persons on a daily basis in KSA. This model can also be utilized to ascertain how stress (or hospital capacity) affects the percentage of hospitalizations and the number of deaths. Additionally, the results of this study can be used to establish policies or strategies for monitoring or restricting COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.},

   abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9-35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.

   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the emergence of various variants of concern (VoCs) that are associated with increased transmissibility, immune evasion, or differences in disease severity. The emergence of VoCs fueled interest in understanding the potential impact of travel restrictions and surveillance strategies to prevent or delay the early spread of VoCs. We performed phylogenetic analyses and mathematical modeling to study the importation and spread of the VoCs Alpha and Delta in Switzerland in 2020 and 2021. Using a phylogenetic approach, we estimated between 383-1,038 imports of Alpha and 455-1,347 imports of Delta into Switzerland. We then used the results from the phylogenetic analysis to parameterize a dynamic transmission model that accurately described the subsequent spread of Alpha and Delta. We modeled different counterfactual intervention scenarios to quantify the potential impact of border closures and surveillance of travelers on the spread of Alpha and Delta. We found that implementing border closures after the announcement of VoCs would have been of limited impact to mitigate the spread of VoCs. In contrast, increased surveillance of travelers could prove to be an effective measure for delaying the spread of VoCs in situations where their severity remains unclear. Our study shows how phylogenetic analysis in combination with dynamic transmission models can be used to estimate the number of imported SARS-CoV-2 variants and the potential impact of different intervention scenarios to inform the public health response during the pandemic.Copyright: © 2023 Reichmuth et al.},

   journal = {Epidemics},

   abstract = {During the summers of 2020 and 2021, the number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Switzerland remained at relatively low levels, but grew steadily over time. It remains unclear to what extent epidemic growth during these periods was a result of the relaxation of local control measures or increased traveling and subsequent importation of cases. A better understanding of the role of cross-border-associated cases (imports) on the local epidemic dynamics will help to inform future surveillance strategies. We analyzed routine surveillance data of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and 2021. We used a stochastic branching process model that accounts for superspreading of SARS-CoV-2 to simulate epidemic trajectories in absence and in presence of imports during summer 2020 and 2021. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health reported 22,919 and 145,840 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and 2021, respectively. Among cases with known place of exposure, 27% (3,276 of 12,088) and 25% (1,110 of 4,368) reported an exposure abroad in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Without considering the impact of imported cases, the steady growth of confirmed cases during summer periods would be consistent with a value of Re that is significantly above the critical threshold of 1. In contrast, we estimated Re at 0.84 (95% credible interval, CrI: 0.78-0.90) in 2020 and 0.82 (95% CrI: 0.74-0.90) in 2021 when imported cases were taken into account, indicating that the local Re was below the critical threshold of 1 during summer. In Switzerland, cross-border-associated SARS-CoV-2 cases had a considerable impact on the local transmission dynamics and can explain the steady growth of the epidemic during the summers of 2020 and 2021.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {COVID-19 arrived in the United States in early 2020, with cases quickly being reported in many states including Pennsylvania. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic and factors associated with increasing cases. While Poisson regression is a natural choice to model case counts, this approach fails to account for correlation due to spatial locations. Being a contagious disease and often spreading through community infections, the number of COVID-19 cases are inevitably spatially correlated as locations neighboring counties with a high COVID-19 case count are more likely to have a high case count. In this analysis, we combine generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for Poisson regression, a popular method for analyzing correlated data, with a semivariogram to model daily COVID-19 case counts in 67 Pennsylvania counties between March 20, 2020 to January 23, 2021 in order to study infection dynamics during the beginning of the pandemic. We use a semivariogram that describes the spatial correlation as a function of the distance between two counties as the working correlation. We further incorporate a zero-inflated model in our spatial GEE to accommodate excess zeros in reported cases due to logistical challenges associated with disease monitoring. By modeling time-varying holiday covariates, we estimated the effect of holiday timing on case count. Our analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio was significantly greater than one, 6-8 days after a holiday suggesting a surge in COVID-19 cases approximately one week after a holiday.Copyright © 2022 Ren, Hwang.

   abstract = {Since COVID-19 has brought great challenges to global public health governance, developing methods that track the evolution of the virus over the course of an epidemic or pandemic is useful for public health. This paper uses anomaly detection models to analyze SARS-CoV-2 virus genome k-mers to predict possible new critical variants in the collected samples. We used the sample data from Argentina, China and Portugal obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) to conduct multiple rounds of evaluation on several anomaly detection models, to verify the feasibility of this virus early warning and surveillance idea and find appropriate anomaly detection models for actual epidemic surveillance. Through multiple rounds of model testing, we found that the LUNAR (learnable unified neighborhood-based anomaly ranking) and LUNAR+LUNAR stacking model performed well in new critical variants detection. The results of simulated dynamic detection validate the feasibility of this approach, which can help efficiently monitor samples in local areas.},

   abstract = {Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health threat. Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with confirmed cases during January 21-February 27 were collected and considered as the specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe epidemics in similar megacities in the world.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {This study analyzes the link between temperature and COVID-19 incidence in a sample of Italian regions during the period that covers the first epidemic wave of 2020. To that end, Bayesian model averaging techniques are used to analyze the relevance of temperature together with a set of additional climatic, demographic, social, and health policy factors. The robustness of individual predictors is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by temperature given that it appears as one of the most relevant determinants reducing regional coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. The strong negative link observed in our baseline analysis is robust to the specification of priors, the scale of analysis, the correction of measurement errors in the data due to under-reporting, the time window considered, and the inclusion of spatial effects in the model. In a second step, we compute relative importance metrics that decompose the variability explained by the model. We find that cross-regional temperature differentials explain a large share of the observed variation on the number of infections. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

   abstract = {Objectives: To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified. Method(s): Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed. Result(s): Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity - network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes, while the data from rank I-III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I-III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable. Conclusion(s): The geo-temporal progression of epidemics seems to be highly structured. Epidemic network properties can distinguish regions that differ in mortality. This real-time geo-referenced analysis can inform both decision-makers and clinicians.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

This is a cross-sectional study based on data collected from adults in 2021 through the Collaborative Response COVID-19 Survey by the MacDonnell Academy at Washington University in St. Louis (United States). The sample was composed of 8, 125 individuals from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Chile. A generalized linear model for a binary outcome variable with a logistic link and fixed country effects was used. There were 2, 336 (28.75%) individuals who considered having suffered alterations in self-perceived mental health. Unemployed individuals (OR = 1.40; 95%CI: 1.24-1.58), those with bad/regular quality of life (OR = 5.03; 95%CI: 4.01-6.31), and those with high socioeconomic status (OR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.41-1.96) had a higher risk of self-perceived mental health alterations than those with full-time employment, excellent quality, and low socioeconomic status. According to the fixed-effects model, Brazilians living in the country during the pandemic, who disagreed with their government's decisions (OR = 2.05; 95%CI: 1.74-2.42) and lacked trust in their government (OR = 2.10; 95%CI: 1.74-2.42) had a higher risk of having self-perceived mental health alterations. Nearly 30% of respondents indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic altered their self-perceived mental health. This outcome was associated with political, sociodemographic, and health risk factors. These findings should help policymakers develop post-pandemic community interventions.Copyright © 2024 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We studied the weekly number and the growth/decline rates of COVID-19 deaths of the period from October 31, 2022, to February 9, 2023, in Italy. We found that the COVID-19 winter wave reached its peak during the three holiday weeks from December 16, 2022, to January 5, 2023, and it was definitely trending downward, returning to the same number of deaths as the end of October 2022, in the first week February 2023. During this period of 15 weeks, that wave caused a number of deaths as large as 8,526. Its average growth rate was +7.89% deaths per week (10 weeks), while the average weekly decline rate was -15.85% (5 weeks). At the time of writing of this paper, Italy has been experiencing a new COVID-19 wave, with the latest 7 weekly bulletins (October 26, 2023 - December 13, 2023) showing that deaths have climbed from 148 to 322. The weekly growth rate had risen by +14.08% deaths, on average. Hypothesizing that this 2023/2024 wave will have a total duration similar to that of 2022/2023, with comparable extensions of both the growth period and the decline period and similar growth/decline rates, we predict that the number of COVID-19 deaths of the period from the end of October 2023 to the beginning of February 2024 should be less than 4100. A preliminary assessment of this forecast, based on 11 of the 15 weeks of the period, has already confirmed the accuracy of this approach.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to everyday life and has had social, political, and financial consequences that will persist for years. Several initiatives with intensive use of technology were quickly developed in this scenario. However, technologies that enhance epidemiological surveillance in contexts with low testing capacity and healthcare resources are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap by developing a data science model that uses routinely generated healthcare encounter records to detect possible new outbreaks early in real-time. Method(s): We defined an epidemiological indicator that is a proxy for suspected cases of COVID-19 using the health records of Emergency Care Unit (ECU) patients and text mining techniques. The open-field dataset comprises 2,760,862 medical records from nine ECUs, where each record has information about the patient's age, reported symptoms, and the time and date of admission. We also used a dataset where 1,026,804 cases of COVID-19 were officially confirmed. The records range from January 2020 to May 2022. Sample cross-correlation between two finite stochastic time series was used to evaluate the models. Result(s): For patients with age 18 years, we find time-lag () = 72 days and cross-correlation () ~ 0.82, = 25 days and ~ 0.93, and = 17 days and ~ 0.88 for the first, second, and third waves, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the developed model can aid in the early detection of signs of possible new COVID-19 outbreaks, weeks before traditional surveillance systems, thereby anticipating in initiating preventive and control actions in public health with a higher likelihood of success.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Background: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January. By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. Method(s): We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. Result(s): The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the R0 in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial R0 of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the R0 to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time. Conclusion(s): The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.Copyright © International Society of Travel Medicine 2020.},

   abstract = {Novel Covid-19 has had a huge impact on the world's population since December 2019. The very rapid spreading of the virus worldwide, with its heavy toll of death and overload of the healthcare systems, induced the scientific community to focus on understanding, monitoring and foreseeing the epidemic evolution, weighing up the impact of different containment measures. An immense literature was produced in few months. Many papers were focused on predicting the peak features through a variety of different models. In the present paper, combining the surveillance data-set with data on mobility and testing, we develop a deterministic compartment model aimed at performing a retrospective analysis to understand the main modifications occurred to the characteristic parameters that regulate the epidemic spreading. We find that, besides self-protective behaviors, a reduction of susceptibility should have occurred in order to explain the fast descent of the epidemic after the peak. A sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number, in response to variations of the epidemiological parameters that can be influenced by policy-makers, shows the primary importance of a rigid isolation procedure for the diagnosed cases, combined with an intensive effort in performing extended testing campaigns. Future scenarios depend on the ability to protect the population from the injection of new cases from abroad, and to pursue in applying rigid self-protective measures.},

The Rt trend during March and April of 2020 was found to be similar to results from other epidemiological reports. The Rt decreased during the first two weeks of March. Its lowest value was reported during the week after the quarantine began. The Rt increased moderately after the second week of April. The implication of early decisions taken to mitigate the transmission are discussed.

Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions. This work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building usage during a pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

To figure out the key controlling factors and validate the model to show the success of the Zero-COVID policy in the province, we constructed a Recursive Zero-COVID Model quantifying the strength of the control measures, and defined the control reproduction number as an index for describing the intensity of interventions. Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis were employed to estimate and validate the impact of changes in the strength of different measures on the intensity of public health preventions qualitatively and quantitatively. The recursive Zero-COVID model predicted that the dates of elimination of cases at the community level of Changchun and Jilin Cities to be on April 8 and April 17, respectively, which are consistent with the real situation. Our results showed that the strict implementation of control measures and adherence of the public are crucial for controlling the epidemic. It is also essential to strengthen the control intensity even at the final stage to avoid the rebound of the epidemic. In addition, the control reproduction number we defined in the paper is a novel index to measure the intensity of the prevention and control measures of public health.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modeling is now frequently used in outbreak investigations to understand underlying mechanisms of infectious disease dynamics, assess patterns in epidemiological data, and forecast the trajectory of epidemics. However, the successful application of mathematical models to guide public health interventions lies in the ability to reliably estimate model parameters and their corresponding uncertainty. Here, we present and illustrate a simple computational method for assessing parameter identifiability in compartmental epidemic models. METHOD(S): We describe a parametric bootstrap approach to generate simulated data from dynamical systems to quantify parameter uncertainty and identifiability. We calculate confidence intervals and mean squared error of estimated parameter distributions to assess parameter identifiability. To demonstrate this approach, we begin with a low-complexity SEIR model and work through examples of increasingly more complex compartmental models that correspond with applications to pandemic influenza, Ebola, and Zika. RESULT(S): Overall, parameter identifiability issues are more likely to arise with more complex models (based on number of equations/states and parameters). As the number of parameters being jointly estimated increases, the uncertainty surrounding estimated parameters tends to increase, on average, as well. We found that, in most cases, R0 is often robust to parameter identifiability issues affecting individual parameters in the model. Despite large confidence intervals and higher mean squared error of other individual model parameters, R0 can still be estimated with precision and accuracy. CONCLUSION(S): Because public health policies can be influenced by results of mathematical modeling studies, it is important to conduct parameter identifiability analyses prior to fitting the models to available data and to report parameter estimates with quantified uncertainty. The method described is helpful in these regards and enhances the essential toolkit for conducting model-based inferences using compartmental dynamic models.},

   volume = {15},
   number = {1},
   pages = {361},
   abstract = {Background: As climate variability and extreme weather events associated with climate change become more prevalent, public health authorities can expect to face an expanding spectrum of vector-borne diseases with increasing incidence and geographical spread. Common interventions include the use of larvicides and adulticides, as well as targeted communications to increase public awareness regarding the need for personal protective measures, such as mosquito repellant, protective clothing, and mosquito nets. Here, we propose a simplified compartmental model of mosquito-borne disease dynamics that incorporates the use of personal protection against mosquito bites influenced by two key individual-level behavioral drivers-concern for being bitten by mosquitos as a nuisance and concern for mosquito-borne disease transmission. Method(s): We propose a modified compartmental model that describes the dynamics of vector-borne disease spread in a naive population while considering the public demand for community-level control and, importantly, the effects of personal-level protection on population-level outbreak dynamics. We consider scenarios at low, medium, and high levels of community-level vector control, and at each level, we consider combinations of low, medium, and high levels of motivation to use personal protection, namely concern for disease transmission and concern for being bitten in general. Result(s): When there is very little community-level vector control, nearly the entire population is quickly infected, regardless of personal protection use. When vector control is at an intermediate level, both concerns that motivate the use of personal protection play an important role in reducing disease burden. When authorities have the capacity for high-level community vector control through pesticide use, the motivation to use personal protection to reduce disease transmission has little additional effect on the outbreak. Conclusion(s): While results show that personal-level protection alone is not enough to significantly impact an outbreak, personal protective measures can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak in conjunction with community-level control. Furthermore, the model provides insight for targeting public health messaging to increase the use of personal protection based on concerns related to being bitten by mosquitos or vector-borne disease transmission.

   abstract = {Raw data on the number of deaths at a country level generally indicate a spatially variable distribution of COVID-19 incidence. An important issue is whether this pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies and sanitary measures overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease.

   abstract = {We aim to evaluate the associations between digital health literacy (DHL) related to COVID-19 and online information-seeking behavior among university students. Method(s): A total of 3.084 students (75.7% women), with an average age of 24.2 (SD = 7.5) participated in this cross-sectional study, most of whom (36.5%) were from social sciences and pursued a bachelor's degree (50.7%). Data on COVID-19-related DHL and online information-seeking behavior were collected using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression models were performed. Result(s): As the pandemic progressed, participants showed a lower chance of achieving a sufficient DHL (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6; 0.9). Using search engines more often (e.g., Google) (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.5; 0.9), Wikipedia (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6; 0.9) and social media (e.g., Facebook) (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6; 0.9) decreased the likelihood of achieving sufficient DHL related to COVID-19. More frequent use of websites of public bodies (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1; 2.5) increased the odds of reporting sufficient DHL. Conclusion(s): DHL is associated with university students' online information-seeking behavior in the time of COVID-19. From a community and public health perspective, programs aiming at improving DHL should be highlighted.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   journal = {Applied soft computing},
   volume = {100},
   pages = {106932},
   abstract = {The need to forecast COVID-19 related variables continues to be pressing as the epidemic unfolds. Different efforts have been made, with compartmental models in epidemiology and statistical models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or computing intelligence models. These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use phone call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS, Seasonal Naive, Prophet and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.

   volume = {161},
   pages = {112306},
   abstract = {Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Zika epidemic in Brazil, have demonstrated both the importance and difficulty of accurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new diseases first emerge, we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration of immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realistic epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning, while less reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases in data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical and a synthetic approach. Using data from Brazil, we compare how well different machine learning models transfer knowledge between two different dataset pairs: case counts of (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and COVID-19. In the synthetic analysis, we generate data with an SIR model using different transmission and recovery rates, and then compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that transfer learning offers the potential to improve predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target disease, though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, these models offer an additional input for decision makers for pandemic response. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   volume = {15},

   pages = {e0239645},
   abstract = {Background As a new emerging infectious disease pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in each country to inform planning of emergency measures to contain its spread. It is essential that appropriate disease control activities are planned and implemented in a timely manner. Thailand was one of the first countries outside China to be affected with subsequent importation and domestic spread in most provinces in the country. Method A key ingredient to guide planning and implementation of public health measures is a metric of transmissibility which represents the infectiousness of a disease. Ongoing policies can utilize this information to plan appropriately with updated estimates of disease transmissibility. Therefore we present descriptive analyses and preliminary statistical estimation of reproduction numbers over time and space to facilitate disease control activities in Thailand. Results The estimated basic reproduction number for COVID-19 during the study ranged from 2.23- 5.90, with a mean of 3.75. We also tracked disease dynamics over time using temporal and spatiotemporal reproduction numbers. The results suggest that the outbreak was under control since the middle of April. After the boxing stadium and entertainment venues, the numbers of new cases had increased and spread across the country. Discussion Although various scenarios about assumptions were explored in this study, the real situation was difficult to determine given the limited data. More thorough mathematical modelling would be helpful to improve the estimation of transmissibility metrics for emergency preparedness as more epidemiological and clinical information about this new infection becomes available. However, the results can be used to guide interventions directly and to help parameterize models to predict the impact of these interventions.Copyright © 2020 Rotejanaprasert et al.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic various ambulatory health care models (SARS-CoV-2 contact points: Subspecialised Primary Care Practices, Fever Clinics, and Special Places for Corona-Testing) were organised in a short period in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a region in Southern Germany. The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. RESULT(S): One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p<0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p<0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study suggest that the Subspecialised Primary Care Practice that were implemented during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic contributed containment of the pandemic. Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice indicated that physical separation of patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection was easier compared to those who continued working in their own practice. Additionally, leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident in dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

   volume = {148},
   pages = {e184},
   abstract = {Purpose: The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)) first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and rapidly spread across the globe. Since most respiratory viruses are known to show a seasonal pattern of infection, it has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonally dependent as well. The present study looks at a possible effect of atmospheric temperature, which is one of the suspected factors influencing seasonality, on the evolution of the pandemic. Basic procedures: Since confirming a seasonal pattern would take several more months of observation, we conducted an innovative day-to-day micro-correlation analysis of nine outbreak locations, across four continents and both hemispheres, in order to examine a possible relationship between atmospheric temperature (used as a proxy for seasonality) and outbreak progression. Main findings: There was a negative correlation between atmospheric temperature variations and daily new cases growth rates, in all nine outbreaks, with a median lag of 10 days. Principal conclusions: The results presented here suggest that high temperatures might dampen SARS-CoV-2 propagation, while lower temperatures might increase its transmission. Our hypothesis is that this could support a potential effect of atmospheric temperature on coronavirus disease progression, and potentially a seasonal pattern for this virus, with a peak in the cold season and rarer occurrences in the summer. This could guide government policy in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres for the months to come.},

   abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is depicted to have high spatial diversity and slow growth, attributable to the dynamics of the mosquito vector and mobility of the human populations. In an effort to understand the transmission dynamics of Zika virus, we formulate a new compartmental epidemic model with a system of seven differential equations and 11 parameters incorporating the decaying transmission rate and study the impact of protection measure on basic public health. We do not fit the model to the observed pattern of spread, rather we use parameter values estimated in the past and examine the extent to which the designed model prediction agrees with the pattern of spread seen in Brazil, via reaction-diffusion modeling. Our work includes estimation of key epidemiological parameters such as basic reproduction number (R0), and gives a rough estimate of how many individuals can be typically infected during an outbreak if it occurs in India. We used partial rank correlation coefficient method for global sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential model parameters. Using optimal control theory and Pontryagin's maximum principle, a control model has been proposed and conditions for the optimal control are determined for the deterministic model of Zika virus. The control functions for the strategies (i) vector-to-human contact reduction and (ii) vector elimination are introduced into the system. Numerical simulations are also performed. This work aimed at understanding the potential extent and timing of the ZIKV epidemic can be used as a template for the analysis of future mosquito-borne epidemics.Copyright © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

   pages = {17689},
   abstract = {COVID-19, a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus, has claimed millions of lives worldwide. Amid soaring contagion due to newer strains of the virus, it is imperative to design dynamic, spatiotemporal models to contain the spread of infection during future outbreaks of the same or variants of the virus. The reliance on existing prediction and contact tracing approaches on prior knowledge of inter- or intra-zone mobility renders them impracticable. We present a spatiotemporal approach that employs a network inference approach with sliding time windows solely on the date and number of daily infection numbers of zones within a geographical region to generate temporal networks capturing the influence of each zone on another. It helps analyze the spatial interaction among the hotspot or spreader zones and highly affected zones based on the flow of network contagion traffic. We apply the proposed approach to the daily infection counts of New York State as well as the states of USA to show that it effectively measures the phase shifts in the pandemic timeline. It identifies the spreaders and affected zones at different time points and helps infer the trajectory of the pandemic spread across the country. A small set of zones periodically exhibit a very high outflow of contagion traffic over time, suggesting that they act as the key spreaders of infection. Moreover, the strong influence between the majority of non-neighbor regions suggests that the overall spread of infection is a result of the unavoidable long-distance trips by a large number of people as opposed to the shorter trips at a county level, thereby informing future mitigation measures and public policies.Copyright © 2021.

In this work, we developed mathematical models for HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) in Brazil, one of the largest and most unequal LMICs, incorporating poverty rates and temporal dynamics to evaluate and forecast the impact of the increase in poverty due to the economic crisis, and estimate the mitigation effects of alternative poverty-reduction policies on the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB up to 2030. Three main intervention scenarios were simulated-an economic crisis followed by the implementation of social protection policies with none, moderate, or strong coverage-evaluating the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB. Without social protection policies to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, the burden of HIV/AIDS and TB would be significantly larger over the next decade, being responsible in 2030 for an incidence 13% (95% CI 4-31%) and mortality 21% (95% CI 12-34%) higher for HIV/AIDS, and an incidence 16% (95% CI 10-25%) and mortality 22% (95% CI 15-31%) higher for TB, if compared with a scenario of moderate social protection. These differences would be significantly larger if compared with a scenario of strong social protection, resulting in more than 230,000 cases and 34,000 deaths from AIDS and TB averted over the next decade in Brazil. Using a comprehensive approach, that integrated economic forecasting with mathematical and epidemiological models, we were able to show the importance of implementing robust social protection policies to avert a significant increase in incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB during the current global economic downturn.Copyright © 2024.

   abstract = {The spatial distribution of the COVID-19 infection rate in the city of Palma (Balearic Islands) is analyzed from the geolocation of positive cases by census tract and its relationship with socioeconomic variables is evaluated. Data on infections have been provided by the Health Service of the Ministry of Health and Consumption of the Government of the Balearic Islands. The study combines several methods of analysis: spatial autocorrelation, calculation of the Gini index and least squares regression, and weighted geographical regression. The results show that the pandemic comprised five waves in the March 2020-March 2022 period, corresponding to the months of April 2020, August 2020, December 2020, July 2021, and January 2022. Each wave shows a particular geographical distribution pattern, however, the second and third waves show higher levels of spatial concentration. In this sense, the second wave, affecting the peripheral neighborhoods of the eastern part of the city. The Gini index confirms geographical imbalances in the distribution of infections in the first waves of the pandemic. In addition, the regression models indicate that the most significant socioeconomic variables in the prediction of COVID-19 infection are average income, percentage of children under 18 years of age, average size of the household, and percentage of single-person households. The study shows that economic imbalances in the city have had a clear influence on the spatial pattern of pandemic distribution. It shows the need to implement spatial justice policies in income distribution to balance the effects of the pandemic. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Method(s): Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5 degreeC, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Result(s): Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6 July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of 7 June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI 5.6-24%) (Belgium). Conclusion(s): We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

In most cases, the curve is well described by the Gompertz function, which is characterized by two essential parameters, the initial growth rate and the decay rate as the first epidemic wave subsides. These parameters are determined by socioeconomic factors and the countermeasures to halt the epidemic. The Gompertz model implies that the total death toll depends exponentially, and hence very sensitively, on the ratio between these rates. The remarkably different epidemic curves for the first epidemic wave in Sweden and Norway and many other countries are classified and discussed in this framework, and their usefulness for the planning of mitigation strategies is discussed.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   abstract = {For dengue fever and other seasonal epidemics we show how the stability of the preceding inter-outbreak period can predict subsequent total outbreak magnitude, and that a feasible stability metric can be computed from incidence data alone. As an observable of a dynamical system, incidence data contains information about the underlying mechanisms: climatic drivers, changing serotype pools, the ecology of the vector populations, and evolving viral strains. We present mathematical arguments to suggest a connection between stability measured in incidence data during the inter-outbreak period and the size of the effective susceptible population. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dengue incidence in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where forecasts can be made as early as three to four months ahead of an outbreak. These results have immediate significance for public health planning, and can be used in combination with existing forecasting methods and more comprehensive dengue models.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).},

Three phases were identified for analysis: first phase starting from January 30 to March 9, 2020; second phase starting from March 10 to May 8 and the last phase from May 9 to May 31, 2020. Data analysis was carried out in MATLAB software. The steps taken by the Kerala government ensured the virus to be contained in the affected persons itself. Community spread was reduced by the implementation of contact tracing and home quarantine. Welfare measures taken during the lockdown helped the people to adjust to the changes. The abstinence of community spread still stands strong. Apart from tackling the Covid-19 virus, Kerala with a series of welfare measures made the life of Kerala citizens comfortable. The model raised by Kerala for fighting against Covid-19 can be considered as a benchmark for how the public health department can be utilised properly.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

A retrospective cohort of patients >18years old with sepsis and organ dysfunction or septic shock was conducted. Univariate analysis was done for variables potentially related to 30-day mortality, and the ones with P values of <0.05 were included in a backward stepwise hierarchic Cox regression model. Variables that remained with P values of <0.05 were retained in the model. A total of 1,190 sepsis episodes were analyzed. Gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in 391 (68.5%) of 571 patients with positive cultures, of which 69 (17.7%) were caused by a CRE organism. Patients with CRE infections had significantly higher 30-day mortality: 63.8% versus 33.4% (P<0.01). CRE infection was also associated with a lower rate of appropriate empirical therapy (P<0.01) and with the presence of septic shock (P<0.01). In the hierarchic multivariate model, CRE remained significant when controlling for demographic variables, comorbidities, and infection site but lost significance when controlling for septic shock and appropriate empirical therapy.

These infections are growing at alarming rates worldwide and are now among the most frequent and difficult-to-treat bacteria due to the very few options for susceptible antimicrobials available. This study examined 1,190 sepsis episodes, and the main findings were as follows: (i) the prevalence of CRE infections significantly increased over time, (ii) CRE infection was associated with higher 30-day mortality than that of patients with other infections (63.8% versus 33.4%), and (iii) the effect of CRE on mortality was probably influenced by the fact that those patients received lower rates of empirical therapy with active antibiotics and were also diagnosed in more advanced stages of sepsis (septic shock).

   abstract = {Objectives: The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a public health emer-gency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Since it was first identified, COVID-19 has infected more than one hundred million people worldwide, with more than two million fatalities. This study focuses on the interpretation of the distribution of COVID-19 in Egypt to develop an effective forecasting model that can be used as a decision-making mechanism to administer health interventions and mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. Method(s): A model was developed using the data collected by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and used it to predict possible COVID-19 cases in Egypt. Result(s): Statistics obtained based on time-series and kinetic model analyses suggest that the total number of CO-VID-19 cases in mainland Egypt could reach 11076 per week (March 1, 2020 through January 24, 2021) and the number of simple regenerations could reach 12. Analysis of the ARIMA (2, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 3) sequences shows a rise in the number of COVID-19 events. Conclusion(s): The developed forecasting model can help the government and medical personnel plan for the imminent conditions and ensure that healthcare systems are prepared to deal with them.Copyright © 2021 by Eurasian Journal of Medicine and Oncology.},

   journal = {Epidemics},
   volume = {37},
   pages = {100491},
   abstract = {Introduction: Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily transmitted byAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes between humans and non-human primates. Climate change may enhance virus reproduction in Aedes spp. mosquito populations, resulting in intensified ZIKV outbreaks. The study objective was to explore how an outbreak similar to the 2016 ZIKV outbreak in Brazil might unfold with projected climate change. Method(s): A compartmental infectious disease model that included compartments for humans and mosquitoes was developed to fit the 2016 ZIKV outbreak data from Brazil using least squares optimization. To explore the impact of climate change, published polynomial relationships between temperature and temperature-sensitive mosquito population and virus transmission parameters (mosquito mortality, development rate, and ZIKV extrinsic incubation period) were used. Projections for future outbreaks were obtained by simulating transmission with effects of projected average monthly temperatures on temperature-sensitive model parameters at each of three future time periods: 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. The projected future climate was obtained from an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) obtained from the Co-Ordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) that used Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) with two radiative forcing values, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of temperature-dependent parameters on the model outcomes. Result(s): Climate change scenarios impacted the model outcomes, including the peak clinical case incidence, cumulative clinical case incidence, time to peak incidence, and the duration of the ZIKV outbreak. Comparing 2070-2100 to 2016, using RCP4.5, the peak incidence was 22,030 compared to 10,473; the time to epidemic peak was 12 compared to 9 weeks, and the outbreak duration was 52 compared to 41 weeks. Comparing 2070-2100 to 2016, using RCP8.5, the peak incidence was 21,786 compared to 10,473; the time to epidemic peak was 11 compared to 9 weeks, and the outbreak duration was 50 compared to 41weeks. The increases are due to optimal climate conditions for mosquitoes, with the mean temperature reaching 28 degreeC in the warmest months. Under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5), mean temperatures extend above optimal for mosquito survival in the warmest months. Conclusion(s): Outbreaks of ZIKV in locations similar to Brazil are expected to be more intense with a warming climate. As climate change impacts are becoming increasingly apparent on human health, it is important to quantify the effect and use this knowledge to inform decisions on prevention and control strategies.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Currently, the novel COVID-19 coronavirus has been widely spread as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has a major influence on human life, healthcare systems, and the economy. There are a large number of methods available for predicting the incidence of the virus. A complex and non-stationary problem such as the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by high levels of uncertainty in its behavior during the pandemic time. The fuzzy logic, especially Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, is a robust and capable model to cope with high-order uncertainties associated with non-stationary time-dependent features. The main objective of the current study is to present a novel Deep Interval Type-2 Fuzzy LSTM (DIT2FLSTM) model for prediction of the COVID-19 incidence, including new cases, recovery cases, and mortality rate in both short and long time series. The proposed model was evaluated on real datasets produced by the world health organization (WHO) on top highly risked countries, including the USA, Brazil, Russia, India, Peru, Spain, Italy, Iran, Germany, and the U.K. The results confirm the superiority of the DIT2FLSTM model with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 96% and a 95% confidence interval of [92-97] % in the short-term and long-term. The DIT2FLSTM was applied to a well-known standard benchmark, the Mackey-Glass time-series, to show the robustness and proficiency of the proposed model in uncertain and chaotic time series problems. The results were evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique and statistically validated through the t-test method. The proposed DIT2FLSTM model is promising for the prediction of complex problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic and making strategic prevention decisions to save more lives.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Pandemic influenza severity assessment is needed to select appropriate surveillance parameters and set thresholds for the assessment of seasonal influenza severity. The objective of this paper is to define threshold values and measure influenza severity indicators. Method(s): Influenza sentinel surveillance data from 2016 to 2018 were used to define baselines and measure three pandemic influenza severity indicators (transmissibility, impact and seriousness of disease). Moving epidemic method (MEM) was used to calculate the indicators and 2018/2019 season data compared to the threshold. The number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases each week was used as a parameter to define transmissibility. SARI hospitalization out of total hospital admissions determined impact. A lack of reliable data meant seriousness could not be defined. Result(s): Based on SARI data, epidemic onset was most often in week 48 and the average epidemic length 18 weeks. Goodness of model values for SARI data with the slope parameter of 2.1 are: sensitivity (0.60), specificity (0.71), positive predictive value (0.39), negative predictive value (0.85). Based on MEM results, ILI and SARI-associated consultation rates were lower in the 2018-2019 season than in the 2017-2018 and 2016-2017 seasons. During the 2018-2019 season SARI cases crossed the epidemic threshold in week 50/2018 with 264 cases and gradually declined. Week 14/2019 saw 217 recorded SARI cases. Based on ILI consultation per 1000 outpatient consultations, the ILI associated consultation rate was below the threshold and lower for the 2018-2019 season compared to the 2017-2018 and 2016-2017 seasons. Conclusion(s): Influenza thresholds based on appropriate parameters have the potential to inform public health measures in a country where monitoring influenza activity has been challenging. Both the ILI and SARI-associated consultation rate was lower in the 2018-2019 season compared to the 2017-2018 and 2016-2017 seasons.},

   journal = {Spatial statistics},
   volume = {49},
   pages = {100519},
   abstract = {The overwhelming spatio-temporal nature of the spread of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic demands urgent attention of data analysts and model developers. Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.

   abstract = {To assist policymakers in making adequate decisions to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate forecasting of the disease propagation is of paramount importance. This paper presents a deep learning approach to forecast the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network applied to multivariate time series. Unlike other forecasting techniques, our proposed approach first groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic aspects and health sector indicators using K-means clustering algorithm. The cumulative case data of the clustered countries enriched with data related to the lockdown measures are fed to the bidirectional LSTM to train the forecasting model. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by studying the disease outbreak in Qatar and the proposed model prediction from December 1st until December 31st, 2020. The quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-art forecasting approaches.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

   journal = {International Journal of Infectious Diseases},
   volume = {98},
   pages = {321-327},
   abstract = {Background: The reproduction number (R0) is vital in epidemiology to estimate the number of infected people and trace close contacts. R0 values vary depending on social activity and type of gathering events that induce infection transmissibility and its pathophysiology dependence. Objective(s): In this study, we estimated the probable outbreak size of COVID-19 clusters mathematically using a simple model that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases as a function of time. Method(s): We proposed a mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in an outbreak occurring in both local and international clusters in light of published data. Different types of clusters (religious, wedding, and industrial activity) were selected based on reported events in different countries between February and April 2020. Result(s): The highest R0 values were found in wedding party events (5), followed by religious gathering events (2.5), while the lowest value was found in the industrial cluster (2). In return, this will enable us to assess the trend of coronavirus spread by comparing the model results and observed patterns. Conclusion(s): This study provides predictive COVID-19 transmission patterns in different cluster types based on different R0 values. This model offers a contact-tracing task with the predicted number of cases, to decision-makers; this would help them in epidemiological investigations by knowing when to stop.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

We compared the spatially averaged results of this model against the MCMA available data. With the model, we estimated the numbers of daily infected and dead persons and the epidemic's duration in the MCMA. In the simulations, we included the small-world effects and the impact of lifting/strengthen lockdown measures. We included some indicators of the goodness of fit; in particular, the Pearson correlation coefficient resulted larger than 0.9 for all the cases we considered.

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a major health threat across the globe, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it is highly contagious with significant mortality. In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: Syndromic surveillance with the use of Internet data has been used to track and forecast epidemics for the last two decades, using different sources from social media to search engine records. More recently, studies have addressed how the World Wide Web could be used as a valuable source for analysing the reactions of the public to outbreaks and revealing emotions and sentiment impact from certain events, notably that of pandemics., Objective: The objective of this research is to evaluate the capability of Twitter messages (tweets) in estimating the sentiment impact of COVID-19 cases in Greece in real time as related to cases., Methods: 153,528 tweets were gathered from 18,730 Twitter users totalling 2,840,024 words for exactly one year and were examined towards two sentimental lexicons: one in English language translated into Greek (using the Vader library) and one in Greek. We then used the specific sentimental ranking included in these lexicons to track i) the positive and negative impact of COVID-19 and ii) six types of sentiments: Surprise, Disgust, Anger, Happiness, Fear and Sadness and iii) the correlations between real cases of COVID-19 and sentiments and correlations between sentiments and the volume of data., Results: Surprise (25.32%) mainly and secondly Disgust (19.88%) were found to be the prevailing sentiments of COVID-19. The correlation coefficient (R2) for the Vader lexicon is -0.07454 related to cases and -0.,70668 to the tweets, while the other lexicon had 0.167387 and -0.93095 respectively, all measured at significance level of p < 0.01. Evidence shows that the sentiment does not correlate with the spread of COVID-19, possibly since the interest in COVID-19 declined after a certain time. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).},

   journal = {Scientific reports},

   pages = {17007},
   abstract = {An ongoing healthcare debate is whether controlling hospital-acquired infection (HAI) from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) will result in lowering the global HAI rate, or if MRSA will simply be replaced by another pathogen and there will be no change in overall disease burden. With surges in drug-resistant hospital-acquired pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic, this remains an important issue. Using a dataset of more than 1 million patients in 51 acute care facilities across the USA, and with the aid of a threshold model that models the nonlinearity in outbreaks of diseases, we show that MRSA is additive to the total burden of HAI, with a distinct 'epidemiological position', and does not simply replace other microbes causing HAI. Critically, as MRSA is reduced it is not replaced by another pathogen(s) but rather lowers the overall HAI burden. The analysis also shows that control of MRSA is a benchmark for how well all non-S. aureus nosocomial infections in the same hospital are prevented. Our results are highly relevant to healthcare epidemiologists and policy makers when assessing the impact of MRSA on hospitalized patients. These findings further stress the major importance of MRSA as a unique cause of nosocomial infections, as well as its pivotal role as a biomarker in demonstrating the measured efficacy (or lack thereof) of an organization's Infection Control program.Copyright © 2022.

Although it has been mentioned in several studies as an alternative to standard in-person care during the COVID-19 pandemic, outcomes of this alternative clinical care model remain to be evaluated. Objective(s): To investigate the outcomes associated with the hybrid ophthalmology telemedicine model during the COVID-19 pandemic for nonurgent and nonprocedural ophthalmological care. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Retrospective, cross-sectional study of all hybrid visits scheduled during the year 2020 in a single academic, hospital-based eye clinic in Boston, Massachusetts. All hybrid ophthalmology telemedicine visits completed in the year 2020 by opthalmologists and optometrists were included. Data were analyzed from January to December 2020. Exposures: Hybrid telemedicine clinical encounters. Main Outcomes and Measures: Four outcome metrics were calculated: (1) need for subsequent procedure visit, (2) medication change, (3) nonurgent, and (4) urgent consultation with another eye clinician. Adverse outcomes were defined as irreversible vision loss and the need for additional in-person evaluation to reach a management decision. Result(s): From April 9 to December 30, 2020, 889 patients (506 female patients [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 62.1 [14.5] years; age range, 13-98 years) completed 940 hybrid visits. The most common visit indications were glaucoma (424 visits [45.1%]) and retinal diseases (499 visits [53.1%]). A total of 25 visits (2.7%) led to a procedure, 22 visits (2.3%) led to a change in medication, and 44 visits (4.7%) were referred for nonurgent consultation with another subspecialty with no instances of urgent referrals. Sixteen patients (1.7%) were referred to the on-call clinician for a same-day emergency in-person visit or recommended for a subsequent standard in-person visit to reach a management decision. There were no cases of irreversible vision loss following a hybrid visit. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that with the appropriate patient selection and clinical setting, the hybrid ophthalmology telemedicine model may be a good alternative to standard in-person visits, particularly for patients with glaucoma and retinal diseases.Copyright © 2022 American Medical Association.

   abstract = {COVID-19 cases have been reported as a global threat and several studies are being con-ducted using various modelling techniques to evaluate patterns of disease dispersion in the upcoming weeks. Here we propose a simple statistical model that could be used to predict the epidemiolog-ical extent of community spread of COVID-19 from the explicit data based on optimal ARIMA model estimators. Raw data was retrieved on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted based on cumulative daily figures of confirmed cases aggregated globally for ten major countries to predict their incidence trend. Statistical analysis was completed by using R 3.5.3 software. The optimal ARIMA model having the lowest Akaike infor-mation criterion (AIC) value for US (0,2,0); Spain (1,2,0); France (0,2,1); Germany (3,2,2); Iran (1,2,1); China (0,2,1); Russia (3,2,1); India (2,2,2); Australia (1,2,0) and South Africa (0,2,2) im-parted the nowcasting of trends for the upcoming weeks. These parameters are (p, d, q) where p refers to the number of autoregressive terms, d refers to the number of times the series has to be differenced before it becomes stationary, and q refers to the number of moving average terms. Results obtained from the ARIMA model showed a significant decrease in cases in Australia; a stable case for China and rising cases have been observed in other countries. This study predicted the possible proliferate of COVID-19, although spreading significantly depends upon the various control and measurement policy taken by each country.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

   abstract = {The pandemic scenery caused by the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, increased interest in statistical models capable of projecting the evolution of the number of cases (and associated deaths) due to COVID-19 in countries, states and/or cities. This interest is mainly due to the fact that the projections may help the government agencies in making decisions in relation to procedures of prevention of the disease. Since the growth of the number of cases (and deaths) of COVID-19, in general, has presented a heterogeneous evolution over time, it is important that the modeling procedure is capable of identifying periods with different growth rates and proposing an adequate model for each period. Here, we present a modeling procedure based on the fit of a piecewise growth model for the cumulative number of deaths. We opt to focus on the modeling of the cumulative number of deaths because, other than for the number of cases, these values do not depend on the number of diagnostic tests performed. In the proposed approach, the model is updated in the course of the pandemic, and whenever a "new" period of the pandemic is identified, it creates a new sub-dataset composed of the cumulative number of deaths registered from the change point and a new growth model is chosen for that period. Three growth models were fitted for each period: exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The best model for the cumulative number of deaths recorded is the one with the smallest mean square error and the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. This approach is illustrated in a case study, in which we model the number of deaths due to COVID-19 recorded in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results have shown that the fit of a piecewise model is very effective for explaining the different periods of the pandemic evolution.},

   abstract = {The development of smartphones technologies has determined the abundant and prevalent computation. An activity recognition system using mobile sensors enables continuous monitoring of human behavior and assisted living. This paper proposes the mobile sensors-based Epidemic Watch System (EWS) leveraging the AI models to recognize a new set of activities for effective social distance monitoring, probability of infection estimation, and COVID-19 spread prevention. The research focuses on user activities recognition and behavior concerning risks and effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed EWS consists of a smartphone application for COVID-19 related activities sensors data collection, features extraction, classifying the activities, and providing alerts for spread presentation. We collect the novel dataset of COVID-19 associated activities such as hand washing, hand sanitizing, nose-eyes touching, and handshaking using the proposed EWS smartphone application. We evaluate several classifiers such as random forests, decision trees, support vector machine, and Long Short-Term Memory for the collected dataset and attain the highest overall classification accuracy of 97.33%. We provide the Contact Tracing of the COVID-19 infected person using GPS sensor data. The EWS activities monitoring, identification, and classification system examine the infection risk of another person from COVID-19 infected person. It determines some everyday activities between COVID-19 infected person and normal person, such as sitting together, standing together, or walking together to minimize the spread of pandemic diseases.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   volume = {161},
   pages = {107675},
   abstract = {COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic that puts the entire world at stake and the healthcare systems across the globe have faced pressing challenges. The number of COVID-19 patients increases rapidly every day. The hospitals across many countries are starving to provide adequate service to the patients due to the shortage of resources and as a consequence, patients do not get admitted to hospitals on time, which in turn creates panic and might contribute to the spread of the pandemic. Under this resource constraint situation, this study proposes a data-driven optimization model for patient allocation in hospitals. First, a compartmental model is developed for characterizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Then, Pareto analysis is carried out to identify the most COVID-affected cities. An optimization model is then developed for optimal patient allocation in hospitals in different cities. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the robustness of our decision model. Using published data for Indian cities, obtained from different websites, the proposed methodology has been validated. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model offers some efficient strategies for optimal allocation of patients. A total of ten cities are identified as the most affected. Besides, four factors, namely cooperation, distances between cities, number of patients, and bed capacity per city emerge as important determinants. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of mobile phone data for monitoring human mobility patterns has become increasingly common, both to study the impact of travel restrictions on population movement and epidemiological modeling. Despite the importance of these data, the use of location information to guide public policy can raise issues of privacy and ethical use. Studies have shown that simple aggregation does not protect the privacy of an individual, and there are no universal standards for aggregation that guarantee anonymity. Newer methods, such as differential privacy, can provide statistically verifiable protection against identifiability but have been largely untested as inputs for compartment models used in infectious disease epidemiology. Our study examines the application of differential privacy as an anonymisation tool in epidemiological models, studying the impact of adding quantifiable statistical noise to mobile phone-based location data on the bias of ten common epidemiological metrics. We find that many epidemiological metrics are preserved and remain close to their non-private values when the true noise state is less than 20, in a count transition matrix, which corresponds to a privacy-less parameter E = 0.05 per release. We show that differential privacy offers a robust approach to preserving individual privacy in mobility data while providing useful population-level insights for public health. Importantly, we have built a modular software pipeline to facilitate the replication and expansion of our framework.

   volume = {5},
   pages = {316-322},
   abstract = {Background: After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Method(s): We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Result(s): In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation(s): Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3-4 days.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

   volume = {19},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As of 13 July 2020, 12.9 million COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide. Prior studies have demonstrated that local socioeconomic and built environment characteristics may significantly contribute to viral transmission and incidence rates, thereby accounting for some of the spatial variation observed. Due to uncertainties, non-linearities, and multiple interaction effects observed in the associations between COVID-19 incidence and socioeconomic, infrastructural, and built environment characteristics, we present a structured multimethod approach for analysing cross-sectional incidence data within in an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) framework at the NUTS3 (county) scale. METHOD(S): By sequentially conducting a geospatial analysis, an heuristic geographical interpretation, a Bayesian machine learning analysis, and parameterising a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), we assessed associations between incidence rates and 368 independent variables describing geographical patterns, socioeconomic risk factors, infrastructure, and features of the build environment. A spatial trend analysis and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation were used to characterise the geography of age-adjusted COVID-19 incidence rates across Germany, followed by iterative modelling using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and measure candidate explanatory variables. Partial dependence plots were derived to quantify and contextualise BART model results, followed by the parameterisation of a GAM to assess correlations. RESULT(S): A strong south-to-north gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the study area into two epidemic subregions. All preliminary and final models indicated that location, densities of the built environment, and socioeconomic variables were important predictors of incidence rates in Germany. The top ten predictor variables' partial dependence exhibited multiple non-linearities in the relationships between key predictor variables and COVID-19 incidence rates. The BART, partial dependence, and GAM results indicate that the strongest predictors of COVID-19 incidence at the county scale were related to community interconnectedness, geographical location, transportation infrastructure, and labour market structure. CONCLUSION(S): The multimethod ESDA approach provided unique insights into spatial and aspatial non-stationarities of COVID-19 incidence in Germany. BART and GAM modelling indicated that geographical configuration, built environment densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and infrastructure all exhibit associations with COVID-19 incidence in Germany when assessed at the county scale. The results suggest that measures to implement social distancing and reduce unnecessary travel may be important methods for reducing contagion, and the authors call for further research to investigate the observed associations to inform prevention and control policy.},

Research that focuses on the view of individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions is still limited, and so are cross-country comparative surveys. We gathered our sample of qualitative data during the first lockdown after governmental measures against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus came into force in Austria, Czechia, Germany, and Slovakia. A total of n = 1690 psychotherapists from four middle European countries answered the question of how the COVID-19 pandemic was addressed in sessions by their patients during the early stage of unprecedented public health conditions. We employed a descriptive qualitative methodology to determine themes following levels of the social-ecological model (SEM) regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic affected patients. At the public policy level, stressful environmental conditions concerned the governmental mitigation efforts. At the level of community/society, reported key themes were employment, restricted access to educational and health facilities, socioeconomic consequences, and the pandemic itself. Key themes at the interpersonal level regarded forced proximity, the possibility of infection of loved ones, childcare, and homeschooling. Key themes at the individual level were the possibility of contracting COVID-19, having to stay at home/isolation, and a changing environment. Within the SEM framework, adaptive and maladaptive responses to these stressors were reported, with more similarities than differences between the countries. A quantification of word stems showed that the maladaptive reactions predominated.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Daily (low cost) data are easily collected at this level, and are worked out for a fast evaluation of the local health status thanks to control systems methods. Precisely, the identifiability of the parameters of the hospital model is proven and thanks to the availability of clinical data, essential characteristics of the local health status are identified.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt change from in-person to online teaching in higher education, resulting in increased use of information and communication technology (ICT) and students' stress and uncertainty. Integrating theories of human motivation, stress, and humane work design, we investigated whether different types of action regulation hindrances (ARH) pertaining to human (ICT competence deficits), technology (technical problems), interaction (coordination difficulties), and task aspects (work overload) related to technostress (H1). Furthermore, we examined if this relationship was mediated by satisfaction of the basic human needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness (H2). Our analysis of causes and mechanisms of technostress is based on cross-sectional survey data (self-report) from 205 psychology students attending an organizational psychology class that was switched from an in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that different types of ARH (i.e., ICT competence deficits, technical problems, coordination difficulties, work overload) positively predicted technostress (beta = .17 to beta = .42, p < .05). The effects were (partially) mediated by satisfaction of the need for autonomy (beta = .11 to beta = .15, p < .05), for all ARH except technical problems (beta = .01, p = .86). We discuss implications for online course planning, technostress prevention as well as potential interventions beyond pandemic times. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.},

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based surveillance has been used alongside diagnostic testing to monitor infection rates. With the decline in cases reported to public health departments due to at-home testing, wastewater data may serve as the primary input for epidemiological models, but training these models is not straightforward. We explored factors affecting noise and bias in the ratio between wastewater and case data collected in 26 sewersheds in California from October 2020 to March 2022. The strength of the relationship between wastewater and case data appeared dependent on sampling frequency and population size, but was not increased by wastewater normalization to flow rate or case count normalization to testing rates. Additionally, the lead and lag times between wastewater and case data varied over time and space, and the ratio of log-transformed individual cases to wastewater concentrations changed over time. This ratio decreased between the Epsilon/Alpha and Delta variant surges of COVID-19 and increased during the Omicron BA.1 variant surge, and was also related to the diagnostic testing rate. Based on this analysis, we present a framework of scenarios describing the dynamics of the case to wastewater ratio to aid in data handling decisions for ongoing modeling efforts.Copyright © 2023},

More than half (58.1%; n = 18) of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in-person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistical difficulties, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth. Strengths related to virtual support included the flexibility and convenience of home-based support, expanded communication strategies, and safety from virus exposure. Further, visits with a lactation professional decreased significantly during the pandemic. Limited in-hospital and pediatrician support were also noted, particularly among groups without access to telehealth resources. CONCLUSION(S): As a result of the pandemic and associated shifts in lactation services, breastfeeding disparities may be further exacerbated among those without equitable access to lactation support. Challenges and innovations in virtual support may influence adaptive options in the field moving forward.},

   abstract = {Background: The current pandemic requires hospitals to ensure care not only for the growing number of COVID-19 patients but also regular patients. Hospital resources must be allocated accordingly. Objective: To provide hospitals with a planning model to optimally allocate resources to intensive care units given a certain incidence of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The analysis included 334 cases from four adjacent counties south-west of Munich. From length of stay and type of ward [general ward (NOR), intensive care unit (ICU)] probabilities of case numbers within a hospital at a certain time point were derived. The epidemiological situation was simulated by the effective reproduction number R, the infection rates in mid-August 2020 in the counties, and the German hospitalization rate. Simulation results are compared with real data from 2nd and 3rd wave (September 2020-May 2021). Results: With R = 2, a hospitalization rate of 17%, mitigation measures implemented on day 9 (i.e., 7-day incidence surpassing 50/100,000), the peak occupancy was reached on day 22 (155.1 beds) for the normal ward and on day 25 (44.9 beds) for the intensive care unit. A higher R led to higher occupancy rates. Simulated number of infections and intensive care unit occupancy was concordant in validation with real data obtained from the 2nd and 3rd waves in Germany. Conclusion: Hospitals could expect a peak occupancy of normal ward and intensive care unit within ~5-11 days after infections reached their peak and critical resources could be allocated accordingly. This delay (in particular for the peak of intensive care unit occupancy) might give options for timely preparation of additional intensive care unit resources.

   abstract = {Structural features and the heterogeneity of disease transmissions play an essential role in the dynamics of epidemic spread. But these aspects can not completely be assessed from aggregate data or macroscopic indicators such as the effective reproduction number. We propose in this paper an index of effective aggregate dispersion (EffDI) that indicates the significance of infection clusters and superspreading events in the progression of outbreaks by carefully measuring the level of relative stochasticity in time series of reported case numbers using a specially crafted statistical model for reproduction. This allows to detect potential transitions from predominantly clustered spreading to a diffusive regime with diminishing significance of singular clusters, which can be a decisive turning point in the progression of outbreaks and relevant in the planning of containment measures. We evaluate EffDI for SARS-CoV-2 case data in different countries and compare the results with a quantifier for the socio-demographic heterogeneity in disease transmissions in a case study to substantiate that EffDI qualifies as a measure for the heterogeneity in transmission dynamics.Copyright: © 2023 Schneckenreither et al.

   abstract = {Background: Efficient control and management in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic needs to carefully balance economical and realizable interventions. Simulation models can play a cardinal role in forecasting possible scenarios to sustain decision support. Method(s): We present a sophisticated extension of a classical SEIR model. The simulation tool CovidSIM Version 1.0 is an openly accessible web interface to interactively conduct simulations of this model. The simulation tool is used to assess the effects of various interventions, assuming parameters that reflect the situation in Austria as an example. Result(s): Strict contact reduction including isolation of infected persons in quarantine wards and at home can substantially delay the peak of the epidemic. Home isolation of infected individuals effectively reduces the height of the peak. Contact reduction by social distancing, e.g., by curfews, sanitary behavior, etc. are also effective in delaying the epidemic peak. Conclusion(s): Contact-reducing mechanisms are efficient to delay the peak of the epidemic. They might also be effective in decreasing the peak number of infections depending on seasonal fluctuations in the transmissibility of the disease.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The estimation of evolutionary parameters provides essential information for designing public health policies. In short time intervals, however, nucleotide substitutions are ineffective to record all complexities of virus population dynamics. In this sense, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a challenge for evolutionary analysis. We used computer simulation to evolve populations in scenarios of varying temporal intervals to evaluate the impact of the age of an epidemic on estimates of time and geography. Before estimating virus timescales, the shape of tree topologies can be used as a proxy to assess the effectiveness of the virus phylogeny in providing accurate estimates of evolutionary parameters. In short timescales, estimates have larger uncertainty. We compared the predictions from simulations with empirical data. The tree shape of SARS-CoV-2 was closer to shorter timescales scenarios, which yielded parametric estimates with larger uncertainty, suggesting that estimates from these datasets should be evaluated cautiously. To increase the accuracy of the estimates of virus transmission times between populations, the uncertainties associated with the age estimates of both the crown and stem nodes should be communicated. We place the age of the common ancestor of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late September 2019, corroborating an earlier emergence of the virus.Copyright © Sociedade Brasileira de Genetica.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimation of the effective reproductive number ([Formula: see text]) of epidemic outbreaks is of central relevance to public health policy and decision making. We present estimateR, an R package for the estimation of the reproductive number through time from delayed observations of infection events. Such delayed observations include confirmed cases, hospitalizations or deaths. The package implements the methodology of Huisman et al. but modularizes the [Formula: see text] estimation procedure to allow easy implementation of new alternatives to the currently available methods. Users can tailor their analyses according to their particular use case by choosing among implemented options., RESULTS: The estimateR R package allows users to estimate the effective reproductive number of an epidemic outbreak based on observed cases, hospitalization, death or any other type of event documenting past infections, in a fast and timely fashion. We validated the implementation with a simulation study: estimateR yielded estimates comparable to alternative publicly available methods while being around two orders of magnitude faster. We then applied estimateR to empirical case-confirmation incidence data for COVID-19 in nine countries and for dengue fever in Brazil; in parallel, estimateR is already being applied (i) to SARS-CoV-2 measurements in wastewater data and (ii) to study influenza transmission based on wastewater and clinical data in other studies. In summary, this R package provides a fast and flexible implementation to estimate the effective reproductive number for various diseases and datasets., CONCLUSIONS: The estimateR R package is a modular and extendable tool designed for outbreak surveillance and retrospective outbreak investigation. It extends the method developed for COVID-19 by Huisman et al. and makes it available for a variety of pathogens, outbreak scenarios, and observation types. Estimates obtained with estimateR can be interpreted directly or used to inform more complex epidemic models (e.g. for forecasting) on the value of [Formula: see text]. Copyright © 2023.

Near real-time monitoring of the pandemic growth is crucial for policy makers and public health officials who need to make informed decisions about whether to enforce lockdowns or allow certain activities. The effective reproduction number Rt is the standard index used in many countries for this goal. However, it is known that due to the delays between infection and case registration, its use for decision making is somewhat limited. In this paper a near real-time COVINDEX is proposed for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic. The index is computed from predictions obtained from a GAM beta regression for modelling the test positive rate as a function of time. The proposal is illustrated using data on COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared with Rt . A simple chart is also proposed for monitoring local and national outbreaks by policy makers and public health officials. Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.},

   volume = {22},

   pages = {190},
   abstract = {Background: After 40 years of its starting, the HIV epidemic in Brazilian Amazon region remains on an increasing trend. The young men who have sex with men (MSM) have been the most impacted by the HIV in the last decade. However, much more than attributing the risk behavior to HIV uniquely to the individual, behaviors are shaped by social determinants of health (SDH). Despite the problem, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating the impact of SDH on HIV among young MSM and none of them were done in the Northern of Brazil. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to analyse the HIV epidemic among Brazilian Amazonian young MSM using temporal trends and spatial analysis. Method(s): We conducted an ecological study using reported cases of HIV/AIDS in young MSM living in Para, the second larger Brazilian Amazonian province, between 2007 and 2018. Data were obtained from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases. For the temporal analysis, we employed a Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess Forecasting model (STLF), which is a hybrid time-series forecast model, that combines the Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting model with the Seasonal-Trend by Loess (STL) decomposition method. For the spatial analysis, Moran's spatial autocorrelation, spatial scan, and spatial regression techniques were used. Result(s): A total of 2192 notifications were included in the study. Greater variabilities in HIV/AIDS population-level diagnosis rates were found in the festive months. The HIV/AIDS population-level diagnosis rates exhibited an upward trend from 2013 and this trend is forecasted to continue until 2022. Belem, the capital of Para, presented the highest spatial risk for HIV/AIDS and was the only city to present spatiotemporal risk from 2014 to 2018. The geographic variation of the HIV epidemic was associated with the number of men with formal jobs, the average salary of men, and the percentage of people over 18 years old with elementary education. Conclusion(s): The upward trend of HIV/AIDS population-level diagnosis rate forecasted until 2022 and the variability of the epidemic promoted by the SDH brings an alert and subsidies to health authorities to implement more efficient and focalized public policies against HIV among young MSM in Para.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and spread worldwide within a few weeks. The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Subnational hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can be a proxy for human contact networks between subnational administrative units. Methods Motivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. We added human contact network analytics, such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature, as regressors. Findings We found that predictions can be improved substantially (by more than 50%) at both the national level and the subnational level for up to 2 weeks. Our subnational analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions. This original application of network analytics from colocalization data to epidemic spread opens new perspectives for epidemic forecasting and public health.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Africa was threatened by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the limited health care infrastructure. Rwanda has consistently used non-pharmaceutical strategies, such as lockdown, curfew, and enforcement of prevention measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Despite the mitigation measures taken, the country has faced a series of outbreaks in 2020 and 2021. In this paper, we investigate the nature of epidemic phenomena in Rwanda and the impact of imported cases on the spread of COVID-19 using endemic-epidemic spatio-temporal models. Our study provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of the epidemic in Rwanda and monitoring its phenomena to inform public health decision-makers for timely and targeted interventions. RESULT(S): The findings provide insights into the effects of lockdown and imported infections in Rwanda's COVID-19 outbreaks. The findings showed that imported infections are dominated by locally transmitted cases. The high incidence was predominant in urban areas and at the borders of Rwanda with its neighboring countries. The inter-district spread of COVID-19 was very limited due to mitigation measures taken in Rwanda. CONCLUSION(S): The study recommends using evidence-based decisions in the management of epidemics and integrating statistical models in the analytics component of the health information system.Copyright © 2023.

Method(s): We constructed a forecast model of the epidemiological scenario via the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) approach. The World Health Organization's COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool was used to evaluate the healthcare resources needed for the next 12 weeks. Result(s): Over the forecast period, there will be 104 713.7 hospital admissions due to severe disease and 34 904.5 hospital admissions due to critical disease. This will require 47 247.7 beds for severe disease and 1929.9 beds for critical disease at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. There will also be high needs for all categories of healthcare workers and for both diagnostic and treatment equipment. Thus, Republic of Kazakhstan faces the need for a rapid increase in available healthcare resources and/or for finding ways to redistribute resources effectively.

The World Health Organization's COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool was used to evaluate the healthcare resources needed for the next 12 weeks., RESULTS: Over the forecast period, there will be 104 713.7 hospital admissions due to severe disease and 34 904.5 hospital admissions due to critical disease. This will require 47 247.7 beds for severe disease and 1929.9 beds for critical disease at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. There will also be high needs for all categories of healthcare workers and for both diagnostic and treatment equipment. Thus, Republic of Kazakhstan faces the need for a rapid increase in available healthcare resources and/or for finding ways to redistribute resources effectively., CONCLUSIONS: Republic of Kazakhstan will be able to reduce the rates of infections and deaths among its population by developing and following a consistent strategy targeting COVID-19 in a number of inter-related directions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and its variants are widely used to predict the progress of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, despite their rather simplistic nature. Nevertheless, robust estimation of the SIR model presents a significant challenge, particularly with limited and possibly noisy data in the initial phase of the pandemic. METHOD(S): The K-means algorithm is used to perform a cluster analysis of the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, to observe if there are any significant differences among countries in terms of robustness. RESULT(S): As a result of model variation tests, the robustness of parameter estimates is found to be particularly problematic in developing countries. The incompatibility of parameter estimates with the observed characteristics of COVID-19 is another potential problem. Hence, a series of research questions are visited. CONCLUSION(S): We propose a Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach to circumvent these potential problems if the basic SIR is the model of choice, and we check the robustness of this new approach by model variation and structured permutation tests. Dissemination of quality predictions is critical for policy- and decision-makers in shedding light on the next phases of the pandemic.},

   abstract = {Background: The World health organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Telemedicine was one of the effective tools that were implemented during this pandemic. Most Lebanese physicians have been using telemedicine to perform virtual medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to assess the physicians' acceptability of telemedicine and willingness to use it in routine health care settings. Objective(s): We developed and validated a tool based on technology acceptance model (TAM) to explore the acceptance of telemedicine use during the pandemic among Lebanese physicians. Theoretical Background: Telemedicine Acceptance Model during Pandemic (TeAM) was developed based on TAM. The model was developed considering the associations between constructs affecting the physicians' attitudes about telemedicine use. TeAM is a tool assessing telemedicine acceptance based on the TAM. It has additional constructs tackling the perceived risks of telemedicine use, the perceived need for policies, the perceived need for training, and the perceived usefulness of telemedicine during a pandemic. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted online through an email-based questionnaire sent to physicians enrolled in the Lebanese Order of Physicians. Result(s): Three hundred ninety physicians (n=390) completed the survey. The tool was structured to test 10 hypotheses, out of which 9 were supported. The Cronbach's alpha score of each construct ranged between 0.745 and 0.905, all greater than 0.7 indicating an acceptable to excellent internal consistency. Conclusion(s): This study was able to validate TeAM as a reliable tool that can assess the acceptance of telemedicine among physicians. Accordingly, several determinants influencing this acceptance were identified. Practice implications include hospitals, primary health care centers, and national health care systems willing to adopt telemedicine can use TeAM to assess the physicians' willingness to accept the implementation of telemedicine in their practice.},

   journal = {Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created challenges in accessing food, water, medications, and healthcare services some of which are linked with lower self-rated health (SRH). These challenges have already been documented in the US, but it remains unknown how the pandemic affected access to food, water, medications and healthcare services, and how these challenges relate to SRH in this group, a population experiencing profound health disparities and limited resources prior to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess associations between challenges accessing food, water, healthcare, and medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and SRH among adults in Puerto Rico. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional analysis of Puerto Rico-CEAL. Adults (>18 years; n=582) completed an online survey (December 30, 2021-February 8, 2022). Presence of each challenge during the past 30 days was measured and analyzed individually and combined (0, 1, >2). SRH (rated from poor-excellent) was measured before and at pandemic. Change in SRH was calculated. Adjusted Poisson models with robust variance errors estimated prevalence ratios (PR). RESULT(S): Experiencing food, water, medication, and healthcare challenges (vs. not) were associated with pandemic fair-poor SRH (PR=1.44, 95%CI=1.06-1.97; PR=1.59, 95%CI=1.15-2.18; PR=1.38, 95%CI=1.05-1.81; and PR=1.56,9 5%CI=1.15-2.12, respectively). Experiencing 2+ challenges (vs. none) was associated with pandemic fair-poor SRH (PR=1.77, 95%CI=1.22-2.55). Additionally, experiencing food, medication, and healthcare challenges (vs. not) was associated with decreased SRH (PR=1.35, 95%CI=1.08-1.69; PR=1.24, 95%CI=1.01-1.51; and PR=1.25, 95%CI=1.01-1.54, respectively), as well as experiencing 2+ challenges (vs. none; PR =1.49, 95%CI=1.15-1.92). CONCLUSION(S): Challenges accessing food, water, medications, and healthcare services during the pandemic were associated with fair-poor SRH and decreased SRH in Puerto Rico.

   journal = {AIMS public health},
   volume = {8},
   number = {1},
   pages = {124-136},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by SARS-CoV-2) has introduced significant challenges for accurate prediction of population morbidity and mortality by traditional variable-based methods of estimation. Challenges to modelling include inadequate viral physiology comprehension and fluctuating definitions of positivity between national-to-international data. This paper proposes that accurate forecasting of COVID-19 caseload may be best preformed non-parametrically, by vector autoregression (VAR) of verifiable data regionally., METHODS: A non-linear VAR model across 7 major demographically representative New York City (NYC) metropolitan region counties was constructed using verifiable daily COVID-19 caseload data March 12-July 23, 2020. Through association of observed case trends with a series of (county-specific) data-driven dynamic interdependencies (lagged values), a systematically non-assumptive approximation of VAR representation for COVID-19 patterns to-date and prospective upcoming trends was produced., RESULTS: Modified VAR regression of NYC area COVID-19 caseload trends proves highly significant modelling capacity of observed patterns in longitudinal disease incidence (county R2 range: 0.9221-0.9751, all p < 0.001). Predictively, VAR regression of daily caseload results at a county-wide level demonstrates considerable short-term forecasting fidelity (p < 0.001 at one-step ahead) with concurrent capacity for longer-term (tested 11-week period) inferences of consistent, reasonable upcoming patterns from latest (model data update) disease epidemiology., CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to macroscopic variable-assumption projections, regionally-founded VAR modelling may substantially improve projection of short-term community disease burden, reduce potential for biostatistical error, as well as better model epidemiological effects resultant from intervention. Predictive VAR extrapolation of existing public health data at an interdependent regional scale may improve accuracy of current pandemic burden prognoses.

   abstract = {Background: The dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic vary owing to local population density and policy measures. During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. Objective(s): We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. Method(s): We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. Result(s): The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt. Conclusion(s): The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous Rt estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.Copyright © 2021 Mark B Shapiro, Fazle Karim, Guido Muscioni, Abel Saju Augustine.},

   abstract = {Early detection of novel pathogens can prevent or substantially mitigate biological incidents, including pandemics. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of symptomatic clinical samples may enable detection early enough to contain outbreaks, limit international spread, and expedite countermeasure development. In this article, we propose a clinical mNGS architecture we call "Threat Net," which focuses on the hospital emergency department as a high-yield surveillance location. We develop a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) simulation model to estimate the effectiveness of Threat Net in detecting novel respiratory pathogen outbreaks. Our analysis serves to quantify the value of routine clinical mNGS for respiratory pandemic detection by estimating the cost and epidemiological effectiveness at differing degrees of hospital coverage across the United States. We estimate that a biological threat detection network such as Threat Net could be deployed across hospitals covering 30% of the population in the United States. Threat Net would cost between $400 million and $800 million annually and have a 95% chance of detecting a novel respiratory pathogen with traits of SARS-CoV-2 after 10 emergency department presentations and 79 infections across the United States. Our analyses suggest that implementing Threat Net could help prevent or substantially mitigate the spread of a respiratory pandemic pathogen in the United States.},

   abstract = {The present study illustrates the outbreak prediction and analysis on the growth and expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic using artificial neural network (ANN). The first wave of the pandemic outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in September 2019 and continued to March 2020. As declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), this virus affected populations all over the globe, and its accelerated spread is a universal concern. An ANN architecture was developed to predict the serious pandemic outbreak impact in Qatar, Spain, and Italy. Official statistical data gathered from each country until July 6th was used to validate and test the prediction model. The model sensitivity was analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error and the regression coefficient index R2, which yielded highly accurate values of the predicted correlation for the infected and dead cases of 0.99 for the dates considered. The verified and validated growth model of COVID-19 for these countries showed the effects of the measures taken by the government and medical sectors to alleviate the pandemic effect and the effort to decrease the spread of the virus in order to reduce the death rate. The differences in the spread rate were related to different exogenous factors (such as social, political, and health factors, among others) that are difficult to measure. The simple and well-structured ANN model can be adapted to different propagation dynamics and could be useful for health managers and decision-makers to better control and prevent the occurrence of a pandemic.

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between interaction and online learning satisfaction, whether this relationship is mediated by academic self-efficacy and student engagement among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A serial mediation model was developed to examine the proposed relationship. This study employed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based research design. A sample of 1,504 Chinese university students (M age=19.89years, SD age=1.93) from five provinces in China completed an online survey questionnaire from December 2020 to January 2021 to respond to questions on demographic characteristics and items to measure the variables in the research model. The partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to assess the measurement model and proposed serial mediation model. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS software version 3.3.2. The results of the measurement model showed good reliability and validity for all constructs. The results of the structural model and hypothesis testing showed that all hypotheses were supported in this study. Particularly, there was a significant positive relationship between interaction and online learning satisfaction (Q1), interaction and academic self-efficacy (Q2), academic self-efficacy and student engagement (Q3), and the student engagement and online learning satisfaction (Q4). In addition, the results showed that academic self-efficacy and student engagement serial mediated the relationship between interaction and online learning satisfaction (Q5). The serial mediation model explained 34.6% of the variance of online learning satisfaction. The findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms that explain students' online learning satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Universities and policymakers need to make better decisions that ultimately could lead to students' academic outcomes and achievement. Copyright © 2021 She, Ma, Jan, Sharif Nia and Rahmatpour.},

   volume = {96},
   pages = {582-589},
   abstract = {Objective: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to proliferate globally, this paper shares the findings of modelling the outbreak in China at both provincial and national levels. This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases. Method(s): An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020. Result(s): The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries. Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19. The model does so by providing a simple logistic framework for retrospectively analyzing outbreaks in regions that have already experienced a maximal proliferation in cases. Based upon statistical findings, this study also outlines certain challenges in modelling and their implications for the results.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

In this paper we design a recursive bifurcation model for analyzing COVID-19 virus spread in different countries. The bifurcation facilitates recursive processing of infected population through linear least-squares fitting. In addition, a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure is utilized to predict the future values of infected populations. Numerical results on the data from two countries (South Korea and Germany) indicate the effectiveness of our approach, compared to a logistic growth model and a Richards model in the context of early forecast. The limitation of our approach and future research are also mentioned at the end of this paper.},

We selected the typical data in demongraphic, economic, medicine and policy strategies from the 2021 statistical yearbook in each Shanghai administration region. Subsequently, we screened out four variables by correlation analysis and multicollinearity analysis. The ordinary least squares model (OLS) test was preferentially selected to analyze the transmission factors among OLS model, spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM). Results The spread of the epidemic in Shanghai was spatially concentrated, with high-high are- as (HH) in Hongkou District, Jingan District, Huangpu District and Xuhui District, low-low areas (LL) in Songjiang District and Jinshan District, and Moran's I insignificance in other areas. The OLS model in- dicated that population density and GDP per capita positively affected the COVID-19 prevalence rate, while number of hospitals per unit and public expenditure on education per capita had no significance. Conclusions Currently, after China manage COVID-19 with measures against Class B infectious dis- ease, residents are encouraged to manage their own health, to do personal health monitoring, to strength- en health protection when traveling. The mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases should be isolated at home, while the severe cases should be treated in hospital.Copyright © 2023, Publication Centre of Anhui Medical University.

Their spatial distribution is important for effective pandemic treatment and daily prevention in cities. This paper used the Kernel Density Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) and shortest distance methods to calculate the accessibility of designated COVID-19 Fangcang hospitals and fever clinics in the Wuhan Metropolitan Development Zone. Their equality was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Lorentz curve. Several results were obtained: (1) The facilities' accessibility declines radial from the central to peripheral areas. (2) Most of the demand points in the study area can reach the medical facilities for COVID-19 pandemic treatment within 60 minutes. (3) For the spatial distribution of these facilities, the equality evaluated for different time thresholds differed significantly, with long time thresholds having better equality than for short time thresholds. (4) While the distances distribution of fever clinics is balanced, the equality gap in various areas remains enormous when considering population distribution. Suggestions for optimizing the spatial distribution of pandemic treatment medical facilities in Wuhan are proposed, and which will serve as references for the planning of Wuhan's pandemic medical facilities in the future.Copyright © 2022 Xiumei Shen.},

   abstract = {Quarantine guidelines that arose with the COVID-19 pandemic limited opportunities for social interaction, raising concerns about increases in intimate partner violence and cyberabuse while simultaneously restricting access to help. The current study assessed increases in cyberabuse, sexual aggression, and intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in a U.S. nationally representative sample of young adults ages 18 to 35, recruited from a probability-based household panel. Data were collected between November 2020 and May 2021. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the prevalence of any self-reported increase in cyberabuse, sexual aggression, or intimate partner victimization or perpetration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression models were run for each outcome measuring any increase compared to no increase. Approximately one in ten U.S. young adults ages 18 to 35 reported experiencing an increase in cyberabuse victimization (12.6%) and cyberabuse perpetration (8.9%) during the pandemic. Similar proportions were observed for increased sexual aggression victimization (11.8%) and perpetration (9.0%). More than one in five respondents (21.4%) reported that their intimate partner was more physically, sexually, or emotionally aggressive toward them during the pandemic. Conversely, 16.2% of respondents reported that they were more physically, sexually, or emotionally aggressive themselves toward an intimate partner, compared to their behavior before the onset of the pandemic. Having an intimate partner and staying at home more than usual during the pandemic were protective factors for both cyberabuse and sexual aggression victimization. Respondent age, education, and race and ethnicity were not associated with increased victimization or perpetration of cyberabuse or sexual aggression. However, women reported lower odds of increased sexual aggression perpetration than men. These findings improve understanding of changes to interpersonal abuse and associated risk factors during a period of social disruption.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has created pervasive upheaval and uncertainty in communities around the world. This investigation evaluated associations between discrete dimensions of personal meaning and psychological adjustment to the pandemic among community residents in a southern US state. In this cross-sectional study, 544 respondents were assessed during a period of reopening but accelerating infection rates. Validated measures were used to evaluate theoretically distinct dimensions of perceived global meaning (Meaning-in-Life Questionnaire) and pandemic-specific meaning (Meaning in Illness Scale). Adjustment outcomes included perceived stress, pandemic-related helplessness, and acceptance of the pandemic. In multivariate models that controlled for demographic and pandemic-related factors, stronger attained global meaning (i.e., perceptions that life is generally meaningful) and attained situational meaning (i.e., perceptions that the pandemic experience was comprehensible) were related to better adjustment on all three outcomes (all p's < .001). In contrast, seeking situational meaning (i.e., ongoing efforts to find coherence in the situation) was associated with poorer adjustment on all indices (all p's < .001). Results offer novel information regarding theoretically salient dimensions of meaning, which may have direct relevance for understanding how community residents adapt to the challenges of a major public health crisis.

   pages = {e81916},
   abstract = {Background: Short-term forecasts of infectious disease contribute to situational awareness and capacity planning. Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise forecasts' predictive performance by combining independent models into an ensemble. Here we report the performance of ensemble predictions of COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe from March 2021 to March 2022. Method(s): We created the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, an online open-access platform where modellers upload weekly forecasts for 32 countries with results publicly visualised and evaluated. We created a weekly ensemble forecast from the equally-weighted average across individual models' predictive quantiles. We measured forecast accuracy using a baseline and relative Weighted Interval Score (rWIS). We retrospectively explored ensemble methods, including weighting by past performance. Result(s): We collected weekly forecasts from 48 models, of which we evaluated 29 models alongside the ensemble model. The ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time, performing better on rWIS than 91% of forecasts for deaths (N=763 predictions from 20 models), and 83% forecasts for cases (N=886 predictions from 23 models). Performance remained stable over a 4-week horizon for death forecasts but declined with longer horizons for cases. Among ensemble methods, the most influential choice came from using a median average instead of the mean, regardless of weighting component models. Conclusion(s): Our results support combining independent models into an ensemble forecast to improve epidemiological predictions, and suggest that median averages yield better performance than methods based on means. We highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death forecasts than case forecasts at horizons greater than two weeks.

Forecasting targets can include measures of prevalent or incident disease and its severity, for some population over a specified time horizon. Researchers, policy makers, and the general public have used such forecasts to understand and respond to the global outbreaks of COVID-19 [1]-[3]. At the same time, forecasters use a variety of methods and models for creating and publishing forecasts, varying in both defining the forecast outcome and in reporting the probability distribution of outcomes [4], [5]. Within Europe, comparing forecasts across both models and countries can support a range of national policy needs simultaneously. European public health professionals operate across national, regional, and continental scales, with strong existing policy networks in addition to rich patterns of cross-border migration influencing epidemic dynamics. A majority of European countries also cooperate in setting policy with inter-governmental European bodies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In this case, a consistent approach to forecasting across the continent as a whole can support accurately informing cross-European monitoring, analysis, and guidance [3]. At a regional level, multi-country forecasts can support a better understanding of the impact of regional migration networks. Meanwhile, where there is limited capacity for infectious disease forecasting at a national level, forecasters generating multi-country results can provide an otherwise-unavailable opportunity for forecasts to inform national situational awareness. Some independent forecasting models have sought to address this by producing multi-country results [6]-[9]. Variation in forecast methods and presentation makes it difficult to compare predictive performance between forecast models, and from there to derive objective arguments for using one forecast over another. This confounds the selection of a single representative forecast and reduces the reliability of the evidence base for decisions based on forecasts. A "forecast hub" is a centralised effort to improve the transparency and usefulness of forecasts, by standardising and collating the work of many independent teams producing forecasts [10]. A hub sets a commonly agreed-upon structure for forecast targets, such as type of disease event, spatio-temporal units, or the set of quantiles of the probability distribution to include from probabilistic forecasts. For instance, a hub may collect predictions of the total number of cases reported in a given country for each day in the next two weeks. Forecasters can adopt this format and contribute forecasts for centralised storage in the public domain. This shared infrastructure allows forecasts produced from diverse teams and methods to be visualised and quantitatively compared on a like-for-like basis, which can strengthen public and policy use of disease forecasts. The underlying approach to creating a forecast hub was pioneered in climate modelling and adapted for collaborative epidemiological forecasts of dengue [11] and influenza in the USA [10], [12]. This infrastructure was adapted for forecasts of short-term COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US [13], [14], prompting similar efforts in some European countries [15]-[17]. Standardising forecasts allows for combining multiple forecasts into a single ensemble with the potential for an improved predictive performance. Evidence from previous efforts in multi-model infectious disease forecasting suggests that forecasts from an ensemble of models can be consistently high performing compared to any one of the component models [11], [12], [18]. Elsewhere, weather forecasting has a long-standing use of building ensembles of models using diverse methods with standardised data and formatting in order to improve performance [19], [20]. The European COVID-19 Forecast Hub [21] is a project to collate short term forecasts of COVID-19 across 32 countries in the European region. The Hub is funded and supported by the ECDC, with the primary aim to provide reliable information about the near-term epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic to the research and policy communities and the general public [3]. Second, the Hub aims to create infrastructure for storing and analysing epidemiological forecasts made in real time by diverse research teams and methods across Europe. Third, the Hub aims to maintain a community of infectious disease modellers underpinned by open science principles. We started formally collating and combining contributions to the European Forecast Hub in March 2021. Here, we investigate the predictive performance of an ensemble of all forecasts contributed to the Hub in real time each week, as well as the performance of variations of ensemble methods created retrospectively. Methods We developed infrastructure to host and analyse prospective forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The infrastructure is compatible with equivalent research software from the US [22], [23] and German and Polish COVID-19 [24] Forecast Hubs, and easy to replicate for new forecasting collaborations. All data and code for this analysis are publicly available on Github [25].Copyright © 2023, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant threat to global public health. Timely detection and response are crucial in mitigating the spread of such epidemics. Inferring the onset time and epidemiological characteristics is vital for accelerating early interventions, but accurately predicting these parameters in the early stages remains challenging., Methods: We introduce a Bayesian inference method to fit epidemic models to time series data based on state-space modeling, employing a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for transmission dynamics analysis. Our approach uses the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including the onset time, the transmission rate, and the recovery rate. The PMCMC algorithm integrates the advantageous aspects of both MCMC and particle filtering methodologies to yield a computationally feasible and effective means of approximating the likelihood function, especially when it is computationally intractable., Results: To validate the proposed method, we conduct case studies on COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing, China, respectively. Using early-stage case reports, the PMCMC algorithm accurately predicted the onset time, key epidemiological parameters, and the basic reproduction number. These findings are consistent with empirical studies and the literature., Conclusion: This study presents a robust Bayesian inference method for the timely investigation of emerging infectious diseases. By accurately estimating the onset time and essential epidemiological parameters, our approach is versatile and efficient, extending its utility beyond COVID-19.

   pages = {5},
   abstract = {Background: The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial disruptions to health services in the low and middle-income countries with a high burden of other diseases, such as malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. Method(s): We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. Then, we simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and NPIs on the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. Result(s): We conduct case studies in four malaria-endemic countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia, in Africa. The epidemiological parameters (i.e., the basic reproduction number R and the duration of infection DI) of COVID-19 in each country are estimated as follows: Ethiopia (R= 1.57 , DI= 5.32), Nigeria (R= 2.18 , DI= 6.58), Tanzania (R= 2.47 , DI= 6.01), and Zambia (R= 2.12 , DI= 6.96). Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, the epidemic curves simulated under various NPIs indicated that the earlier the interventions are implemented, the better the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, the effect of combined NPIs is better than contact restriction and social distancing only. By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. Conclusion(s): By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

Accurate pandemic caseload forecasting allows informed policy decisions on the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce disease transmission. Using COVID-19 as an example, we present Pandemic conditional Ordinary Differential Equation (PAN-cODE), a deep learning method to forecast daily increases in pandemic infections and deaths. By using a deep conditional latent variable model, PAN-cODE can generate alternative caseload trajectories based on alternate adoptions of NPIs, allowing stakeholders to make policy decisions in an informed manner. PAN-cODE also allows caseload estimation for regions that are unseen during model training. We demonstrate that, despite using less detailed data and having fully automated training, PAN-cODE's performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on 4-week-ahead and 6-week-ahead forecasting. Finally, we highlight the ability of PAN-cODE to generate realistic alternative outcome trajectories on select US regions.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

It compared the predictive capabilities of time-series and deep learning models against ILI emergency incidents. Result(s): The GT searches for "fever" and "cough" were significantly associated with ILI cases (p < 0.05). Temperature had a more substantial impact on ILI incidence than humidity. Among the tested models, ARIMA provided the best predictive power. Conclusion(s): GT and climate data can forecast ILI trends, aiding governmental decision making. Temperature is a crucial predictor, and ARIMA models excel in forecasting ILI incidences.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological distributions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the intervals from symptom onset to diagnosis, reporting, or death, are important for developing effective disease-control strategies. COVID-19 case data (from 19 January 2020 to 10 January 2022) from a national database maintained by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the Central Disease Control Headquarters were analyzed. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling was used and yielded probability distribution models of key epidemiological distributions in Korea. Serial intervals from before and during the Delta variant's predominance were estimated. Although the mean symptom-onset-to-report interval was 3.2 days at the national level, it varied across different regions (2.9-4.0 days). Gamma distribution showed the best fit for the onset-to-death interval (with heterogeneity in age, sex, and comorbidities) and the reporting-to-death interval. Log-normal distribution was optimal for ascertaining the onset-to-diagnosis and onset-to-report intervals. Serial interval (days) was shorter before the Delta variant-induced outbreaks than during the Delta variant's predominance (4.4 vs. 5.2 days), indicating the higher transmission potential of the Delta variant. The identified heterogeneity in region-, age-, sex-, and period-based distributions of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 will facilitate the development of effective interventions and disease-control strategies.Copyright © 2022, MDPI.

   abstract = {Background: This paper uses a SEIR(D) model to analyse the time-varying transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea throughout its multiple stages of development. This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit compared to the whole period analysis and shows how the COVID-19's infection patterns change over time, primarily depending on the effectiveness of the public health authority's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Method(s): This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a manually compiled COVID-19 epidemic dataset for the period between 18 February 2020 and 08 February 2021. The paper identifies three major stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, conducts multi-stage estimations of the SEIR(D) model parameters, and carefully infers context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to help better understand the unique patterns of the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in each stage. Result(s): The original SIR compartment model may produce a poor and even misleading estimation result if it is used to cover the entire period of the epidemic. However, if we use the model carefully in distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can find useful insights into the nature of the transmission of the novel coronavirus and the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions over time.Key messages Identifies three distinctive waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea.

The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 vary over time, primarily depending on the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

   pages = {101660},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has placed severe demands on healthcare facilities across the world, and in several countries, makeshift COVID-19 centres have been operationalised to handle patient overflow. In developing countries such as India, the public healthcare system (PHS) is organised as a hierarchical network with patient flows from lower-tier primary health centres (PHC) to mid-tier community health centres (CHC) and downstream to district hospitals (DH). In this study, we demonstrate how a network-based modelling and simulation approach utilising generic modelling principles can (a) quantify the extent to which the existing facilities in the PHS can effectively cope with the forecasted COVID-19 caseload; and (b) inform decisions on capacity at makeshift COVID-19 Care Centres (CCC) to handle patient overflows. We apply the approach to an empirical study of a local PHS comprising ten PHCs, three CHCs, one DH and one makeshift CCC. Our work demonstrates how the generic modelling approach finds extensive use in the development of simulations of multi-tier facility networks that may contain multiple instances of generic simulation models of facilities at each network tier. Further, our work demonstrates how multi-tier healthcare facility network simulations can be leveraged for capacity planning in health crises. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Mathematical modeling of vector-borne diseases and forecasting of epidemics outbreak are global challenges and big point of concern worldwide. The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as "coronavirus" (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. Objective(s): The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. Method(s): Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. Result(s): This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model. Conclusion(s): This computational technique is shown extraordinary results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The outcomes of this study will be useful in forecasting the progression of COVID-19, the influence of several deciding parameters overspread of COVID-19 and can help for planning, monitoring as well as preventing the spread of COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Background: Coronavirus pandemic, a serious global public health threat, affects the Southern African countries more than any other country on the continent. The region has become the epicenter of the coronavirus with South Africa accounting for the most cases. To cap the deadly effect caused by the pandemic, we apply a statistical modelling approach to investigate and predict COVID-19 incidence. Method(s): Using secondary data on the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per million for Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) member states from March 5, 2020, to July 15, 2021, we model and forecast the spread of coronavirus in the region. We select the best ARIMA model based on the log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC of the fitted models. Result(s): The ARIMA (11,1,11) model for the complete data set was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and the Box-Ljung test. The ARIMA(11,1,9) was the best candidate for the training set. A 15-day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a perfect fit with the testing set. Conclusion(s): The number of new COVID-19 cases per million for the SADC shows a downward trend, but the trend is characterized by peaks from time to time. Tightening up of the preventive measures continuously needs to be adapted in order to eradicate the coronavirus epidemic from the population.Copyright © 2023, African Traditional, Herbal Medicine Supporters Initiative.

   pages = {3732},
   abstract = {In the absence of real-time surveillance data, it is difficult to derive an early warning system and potential outbreak locations with the existing epidemiological models, especially in resource-constrained countries. We proposed a contagion risk index (CR-Index)-based on publicly available national statistics-founded on communicable disease spreadability vectors. Utilizing the daily COVID-19 data (positive cases and deaths) from 2020 to 2022, we developed country-specific and sub-national CR-Index for South Asia (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and identified potential infection hotspots-aiding policymakers with efficient mitigation planning. Across the study period, the week-by-week and fixed-effects regression estimates demonstrate a strong correlation between the proposed CR-Index and sub-national (district-level) COVID-19 statistics. We validated the CR-Index using machine learning methods by evaluating the out-of-sample predictive performance. Machine learning driven validation showed that the CR-Index can correctly predict districts with high incidents of COVID-19 cases and deaths more than 85% of the time. This proposed CR-Index is a simple, replicable, and easily interpretable tool that can help low-income countries prioritize resource mobilization to contain the disease spread and associated crisis management with global relevance and applicability. This index can also help to contain future pandemics (and epidemics) and manage their far-reaching adverse consequences.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).},

   journal = {Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {100684},
   abstract = {Background: Having inadequate health care systems and poor socio-economic infrastructure, Bangladesh has been braving to contain the impact of current COVID-19 pandemic since March, 2020. To curb the diffusion of COVID-19, the local government has responded to the outbreak by enforcing a set of restricted measures on economic and social activities across the country. Objective(s): Here, we aim to assess the propagation of COVID-19 by estimating the coronavirus active cases and mortality rate in two major business hubs of Bangladesh, namely Dhaka and Chittagong city under flexible lockdown conditions. Method(s): We apply a data-driven forecasting model using Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deaths status through time to deal with coronavirus outbreak. Result(s): The epidemiological model forecasts the dire consequences for Dhaka city with 2400 death cases at the end of December, 2020, whereas Chittagong city might experience 14% more deaths than Dhaka if the severe restrictions are not implemented to control the pandemic. Conclusion(s): Although lockdown has a positive impact in reducing the diffusion of COVID-19, it is disastrous for human welfare and national economies. Therefore, a unidirectional decision by the policymakers might cost a very high price on either way for a lower-middle-income country, Bangladesh. In this study, we suggest a fair trade-off between public health and the economy to avoid enormous death tolls and economic havoc in Bangladesh.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

Six-hundred and twenty-three nurses across 68 hospitals who were in direct contact with COVID-19 patients during the fifth wave of the pandemic in Iran were recruited. Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) and Structural Equation Modelling using Amos were used to analyze the data. Results revealed that both psychosocial safety climate and supportive leadership improved personal resilience through personal hope. Findings showed that the positive relationship between supportive leadership and personal hope was stronger when the hospital-level psychosocial safety climate was high. To improve personal hope and resilience among nurses during critical times, hospital management must ensure consistent supportive leadership and establish policies, practices and procedures that support nurses' psychosocial health and safety at the hospital level.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   journal = {Disaster medicine and public health preparedness},
   volume = {17},
   pages = {e481},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: North Dakota (ND) had the highest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case and mortality rate in the United States for nearly 2 mo. This study aims to compare 3 metrics ND used to guide public health action across its 53 counties. METHOD(S): Daily COVID-19 case and death totals in North Dakota were evaluated using data from the COVID-tracker website provided by the North Department of Health (NDDoH). It was reported as: active cases per 10,000, tests administered per 10,000, and test positivity rate (the North Dakota health metric). The COVID-19 Response press conferences provided data for the Governor's metric. The Harvard model used daily new cases per 100,000. A chi-squared test was used to compare differences in these 3 metrics on July 1, August 26, September 23, and November 13, 2020. RESULT(S): On July 1, no significant difference between the metrics was found. By September 23, Harvard's health metric indicated critical risk while ND's health metric was moderate risk, and the Governor's metric was still low risk. CONCLUSION(S): ND's and the Governor's metric underrepresented the risk of the COVID-19 outbreak in North Dakota. The Harvard metric reflected North Dakota's increasing risk; it should be considered as a national standard in future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Model-based predictors could guide policy-makers to effectively control spread of infectious disease; proactive models could reduce risk of disease as it progresses in vulnerable communities.},

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) outbreaks occur annually, with seasonal peaks varying among geographic regions. Case notification is important to prepare healthcare networks for patient attendance and hospitalization. Thus, health managers need adequate resource planning tools for SARI seasons. This study aims to predict SARI outbreaks based on models generated with machine learning using SARI hospitalization notification data. In this study, data from the reporting of SARI hospitalization cases in Brazil from 2013 to 2020 were used, excluding SARI cases caused by COVID-19. These data were prepared to feed a neural network configured to generate predictive models for time series. The neural network was implemented with a pipeline tool. Models were generated for the five Brazilian regions and validated for different years of SARI outbreaks. By using neural networks, it was possible to generate predictive models for SARI peaks, volume of cases per season, and for the beginning of the pre-epidemic period, with good weekly incidence correlation (R2 = 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98, for the 2019 season in the Southeastern Brazil). The predictive models achieved a good prediction of the volume of reported cases of SARI; accordingly, 9,936 cases were observed in 2019 in Southern Brazil, and the prediction made by the models showed a median of 9,405 (95%CI: 9,105-9,738). The identification of the period of occurrence of a SARI outbreak is possible using predictive models generated with neural networks and algorithms that employ time series.Copyright © 2024 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced policy makers to decree urgent confinements to stop a rapid and massive contagion. However, after that stage, societies are being forced to find an equilibrium between the need to reduce contagion rates and the need to reopen their economies. The experience hitherto lived has provided data on the evolution of the pandemic, in particular the population dynamics as a result of the public health measures enacted. This allows the formulation of forecasting mathematical models to anticipate the consequences of political decisions. Here we propose a model to do so and apply it to the case of Portugal. With a mathematical deterministic model, described by a system of ordinary differential equations, we fit the real evolution of COVID-19 in this country. After identification of the population readiness to follow social restrictions, by analyzing the social media, we incorporate this effect in a version of the model that allow us to check different scenarios. This is realized by considering a Monte Carlo discrete version of the previous model coupled via a complex network. Then, we apply optimal control theory to maximize the number of people returning to "normal life" and minimizing the number of active infected individuals with minimal economical costs while warranting a low level of hospitalizations. This work allows testing various scenarios of pandemic management (closure of sectors of the economy, partial/total compliance with protection measures by citizens, number of beds in intensive care units, etc.), ensuring the responsiveness of the health system, thus being a public health decision support tool.},

   abstract = {The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) in Brazil has been associated with major impacts on the epidemiological and public health scenario. In this study, 291,571 samples were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 variants from August 2021 to March 2022 (the highest peak of positive cases) in four geographical regions of Brazil. To identify the frequency, introduction, and dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 variants in 12 Brazilian capitals, VOCs defining spike mutations were identified in 35,735 samples through genotyping and viral genome sequencing. Omicron VOC was detected in late November 2021 and replaced the Delta VOC in approximately 3.5 weeks. We estimated viral load differences between SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron through the evaluation of the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) score in 77,262 samples. The analysis demonstrated that the Omicron VOC has a lower viral load in infected patients than the Delta VOC. Analyses of clinical outcomes in 17,586 patients across the country indicated that individuals infected with Omicron were less likely to need ventilatory support. The results of our study reinforce the importance of surveillance programs at the national level and showed the introduction and faster dispersion of Omicron over Delta VOC in Brazil without increasing the numbers of severe cases of COVID-19.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {In this study, we investigate the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazilian cities, using early-time approximations of the SIR model in networks and combining the VAR (vector autoregressive) model with machine learning techniques. Different from other works, the underlying network was constructed by inputting real-world data on local COVID-19 cases reported by Brazilian cities into a regularized VAR model. This model estimates directional COVID-19 transmission channels (connections or links between nodes) of each pair of cities (vertices or nodes) using spectral network analysis. Despite the simple epidemiological model, our predictions align well with the real COVID-19 dynamics across Brazilian municipalities, using data only up until May 2020. Given the rising number of infectious people in Brazil-a possible indicator of a second wave-these early-time approximations could be valuable in gauging the magnitude of the next contagion peak. We further examine the effect of public health policies, including social isolation and mask usage, by creating counterfactual scenarios to quantify the human impact of these public health measures in reducing peak COVID-19 cases. We discover that the effectiveness of social isolation and mask usage varies significantly across cities. We hope our study will support the development of future public health measures.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on medical education. Due to social distancing guidelines, many educational activities were canceled or moved to virtual classrooms. Additionally, in order to limit COVID-19 exposures and preserve personal protective equipment, in-hospital patient interactions were minimized and elective procedures were postponed. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship training. METHOD(S): A national cross-sectional internet-based survey of ACGME-accredited PCCM fellowship programs was performed. Responses were anonymous and collected in February 2021. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. RESULT(S): A total of 34 PDs and 92 fellows responded to the survey (rate of 47% and 17% respectively). The majority (69%) of respondents agreed that medical education had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. When PDs were surveyed, 91% noted a decrease in patient census since March 2020, with 59% citing a >15% decrease. Further, 65% reported trainees had less procedural experience. All respondents reported that education was provided through virtual learning platforms, with nearly half having exclusive remote learning without in-person sessions. Fifty percent of PDs and 62% of fellows reported decreased learner engagement during virtual didactics. The majority of PDs reported decreases in simulation, procedural skills training, and ultrasound training. Few PDs and fellows (13-16%) reported redeployment to adult units, with northeastern programs having the highest rates. In univariate analyses, decreased PD confidence in trainee procedural skills was associated with reported decreases in number of procedures (p=0.0006) and procedural skills didactics (p=0.0245). Change in unit census was associated with less confidence in fellows' medical knowledge (p=0.0004), management skills (p=0.0232), and procedural skills (p=0.0003), with larger decreases in patient census correlating with larger decreases in confidence. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the education and clinical training of PCCM fellows. More knowledge on this topic can assist PDs in curriculum changes for the future to address any gaps in learning that have occurred.},

   abstract = {Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Background: The Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) outbreaks in 2019 as pandemic. Method(s): This research work made an analysis of the nCoV-2019 outbreak in India solely based on a mathematical model. Result(s): The historical epidemics in the world are plague, AIDS, Swine flu, ebola, zika virus, Black Death and SARS. Considering the model used for SARS 2003, the present research on COVID-2019 estimates characteristics of the rate of infections (I) and rate of recovery(R), which leads to the estima-tion of the I and R leading to predict the number of infections and recovery. Through ruling out the un-predictable and unreasonable data, the model predicts that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach from 3398458 (mid of May) to 15165863, with a peak of the unrecovered infection (2461434-15165863) occurring in late April to late July. In this paper, we predicate how the confirmed infected cases would rapidly decrease until late March to July in India. We also focus on how the Gov-ernment of Odisha (a state of India) creates history in the protective measures of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The growing infected cases may get reduced by 70-79% by strong anti-epidemic measures. The enforcement of shutdown, lockdown, awareness, and improvement of medical and health care could also lead to about one-half transmission decrease and constructively abridge the duration of the 2019 n-CoV.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

   abstract = {This work presents simulation results for different mitigation and confinement scenarios for the propagation of COVID-19 in the metropolitan area of Madrid. These scenarios were implemented and tested using EpiGraph, an epidemic simulator which has been extended to simulate COVID-19 propagation. EpiGraph implements a social interaction model, which realistically captures a large number of characteristics of individuals and groups, as well as their individual interconnections, which are extracted from connection patterns in social networks. Besides the epidemiological and social interaction components, it also models people's short and long-distance movements as part of a transportation model. These features, together with the capacity to simulate scenarios with millions of individuals and apply different contention and mitigation measures, gives EpiGraph the potential to reproduce the COVID-19 evolution and study medium-term effects of the virus when applying mitigation methods. EpiGraph, obtains closely aligned infected and death curves related to the first wave in the Madrid metropolitan area, achieving similar seroprevalence values. We also show that selective lockdown for people over 60 would reduce the number of deaths. In addition, evaluate the effect of the use of face masks after the first wave, which shows that the percentage of people that comply with mask use is a crucial factor for mitigating the infection's spread.Copyright © 2021 Singh, Marinescu, Guzman-Merino, Duran, Delgado-Sanz, Gomez-Barroso and Carretero.},

Hence, the present study aims to study the temporal trend of TB cases and assess the impact of lockdown on TB detection. A retrospective record-based study was conducted in a tertiary care institute of India. A time series analysis of TB cases from April 2018 to May 2020 was carried out. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) model was used to forecast TB cases during the lockdown period and the result was compared with actual cases detected. The statistical analysis was accomplished with R software. The time series analysis showed that the projected TB cases in April and May 2020 were 67 and 86, respectively, while the observed cases in these months were 35 and 76. The trend of TB cases during the study period showed no steady increase or decrease and the detection of TB has declined during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The TB cases peaked from April to June and males constitute the majority of TB cases. Copyright: © 2023 Indian Journal of Community Medicine.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus infection has become a global threat affecting almost every country in the world. As a result, it has become important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these covariates., METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase)., RESULTS: The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model., CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.

   abstract = {The severe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation of public health emergency and global awareness. In our research, we analyzed the demographical factors affecting the global pandemic spread along with the features that lead to death due to the infection. Modeling results stipulate that the mortality rate increase as the age increase and it is found that most of the death cases belong to the age group 60-80. Cluster-based analysis of age groups is also conducted to analyze the maximum targeted age-groups. An association between positive COVID-19 cases and deceased cases are also presented, with the impact on male and female death cases due to corona. Additionally, we have also presented an artificial intelligence-based statistical approach to predict the survival chances of corona infected people in South Korea with the analysis of the impact on the exploratory factors, including age-groups, gender, temporal evolution, etc. To analyze the coronavirus cases, we applied machine learning with hyperparameters tuning and deep learning models with an autoencoder-based approach for estimating the influence of the disparate features on the spread of the disease and predict the survival possibilities of the quarantined patients in isolation. The model calibrated in the study is based on positive corona infection cases and presents the analysis over different aspects that proven to be impactful to analyze the temporal trends in the current situation along with the exploration of deceased cases due to coronavirus. Analysis delineates key points in the outbreak spreading, indicating that the models driven by machine intelligence and deep learning can be effective in providing a quantitative view of the epidemical outbreak.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since its emergence in late December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a pandemic in mid of March with many countries suffering heavy human loss and declaring emergency conditions to contain its spread. The impact of the disease, while it has been relatively low in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as of May 2020, is feared to be potentially devastating given the less developed and fragmented healthcare system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures practised may not be effective due to their limited affordability as well as the communal way people in SSA live in relative isolation in clusters of large as well as smaller population centres., METHODS: To address the acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it sweeps through the African region, we developed a process-based model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, taking local context into consideration. We further used the model to estimate the number of infections within a year of sustained local transmissions under scenarios that cover different population sizes, urban status, effectiveness and coverage of social distancing, contact tracing and usage of cloth face mask., RESULTS: We showed that when implemented early, 50% coverage of contact tracing and face mask, with 33% effective social distancing policies can bringing the epidemic to a manageable level for all population sizes and settings we assessed. Relaxing of social distancing in urban settings from 33% to 25% could be matched by introduction and maintenance of face mask use at 43%., CONCLUSIONS: In SSA countries with limited healthcare workforce, hospital resources and intensive care units, a robust system of social distancing, contact tracing and face mask use could yield in outcomes that prevent several millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the continent.

In this study, we employ the modified Richards model to analyze the growth of an epidemic in terms of 1) the number of times cumulative cases double until the epidemic peaks and 2) the rate at which the intervals between consecutive doubling times increase during the early ascending stage of the outbreak. Our theoretical analysis of doubling times is combined with rigorous numerical simulations and uncertainty quantification using synthetic and real data for COVID-19 pandemic. The doubling-time approach allows to employ early epidemic data to differentiate between the most dangerous threats, which double in size many times over the intervals that are nearly invariant, and the least transmissible diseases, which double in size only a few times with doubling periods rapidly growing.},

   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19, and has caused high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as COVID-19 over the near-term. A modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model was developed to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks. The modification allows for the production of precise daily estimates, which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes. The m-IDEA model was employed using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of COVID-19. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were applied. Model fitting was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts, and performance was retrospectively assessed. The performance of the m-IDEA for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals (1-4 days) at early stages of the pandemic, and longer serial intervals at mid- to late-stages (5-9 days) thus far. This, coupled with epidemiological reports, suggests that the serial interval of COVID-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses, which is rather intuitive: Increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures, public caution and social distancing, thus increasing the time between transmission events. In most cases, the stochastic approach captured the majority of future reported incidence data, because it accounts for the uncertainty around the serial interval of COVID-19. As such, it is the preferred approach for using the m-IDEA during dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on citizens and health care systems globally. Valid near-term projections of cases are required to inform the escalation, maintenance and de-escalation of public health measures, and for short-term health care resource planning. Method(s): Near-term case and epidemic growth rate projections for Canada were estimated using three phenomenological models: the logistic model, Generalized Richard's model (GRM) and a modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, these models have been validated against official national epidemiological data on an ongoing basis. Result(s): The best-fit models estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases predicted to be reported in Canada as of April 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 would be 11,156 (90 % prediction interval: 9,156-13,905) and 54,745 (90 % prediction interval: 54,252-55,239). The three models varied in their projections and their performance over the first seven weeks of their implementation. Both the logistic model and GRM under-predicted cases reported a week following the projection date in nearly all instances. The logistic model performed best at the early stages, the m-IDEA model performed best at the later stages, and the GRM performed most consistently during the full period assessed. Conclusion(s): All three models have yielded qualitatively comparable near-term forecasts of cases and epidemic growth for Canada. Under or over-estimation of projected cases and epidemic growth by these models could be associated with changes in testing policies and/or public health measures. Simple forecasting models can be invaluable in projecting the changes in trajectory of subsequent waves of cases to provide timely information to support the pandemic response.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {By October 2021, 230 million SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses have been reported. Yet, a considerable proportion of cases remains undetected. Here, we propose GInPipe, a method that rapidly reconstructs SARS-CoV-2 incidence profiles solely from publicly available, time-stamped viral genomes. We validate GInPipe against simulated outbreaks and elaborate phylodynamic analyses. Using available sequence data, we reconstruct incidence histories for Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, and Victoria (Australia) and demonstrate, how to use the method to investigate the effects of changing testing policies on case ascertainment. Specifically, we find that under-reporting was highest during summer 2020 in Europe, coinciding with more liberal testing policies at times of low testing capacities. Due to the increased use of real-time sequencing, it is envisaged that GInPipe can complement established surveillance tools to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In post-pandemic times, when diagnostic efforts are decreasing, GInPipe may facilitate the detection of hidden infection dynamics.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Robust epidemiological models relating wastewater to community disease prevalence are lacking. Assessments of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have relied primarily on convenience sampling, which does not provide reliable estimates of community disease prevalence due to inherent biases. This study conducted serial stratified randomized samplings to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 3717 participants, and obtained weekly samples of community wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Jefferson County, KY (USA) from August 2020 to February 2021. Using an expanded Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, the longitudinal estimates of the disease prevalence were obtained and compared with the wastewater concentrations using regression analysis. The model analysis revealed significant temporal differences in epidemic peaks. The results showed that in some areas, the average incidence rate, based on serological sampling, was 50 % higher than the health department rate, which was based on convenience sampling. The model-estimated average prevalence rates correlated well with the wastewater (correlation = 0.63, CI (0.31,0.83)). In the regression analysis, a one copy per ml-unit increase in weekly average wastewater concentration of SARS-CoV-2 corresponded to an average increase of 1-1.3 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 residents. The analysis indicates that wastewater may provide robust estimates of community spread of infection, in line with the modeled prevalence estimates obtained from stratified randomized sampling, and is therefore superior to publicly available health data.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States, we explore correlates of transmission across US states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modeling. We find that policy intervention ("lockdown") and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of COVID-19, reveal its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.Copyright © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread exponentially across the United States. Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications., METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged >=18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations., RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patient's total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%)., CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs. The interactive map can also aid in proactive planning and preparations among employers that are deemed critical, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual model and novel, comprehensive framework that encompass the myriad ways informatics and technology can support public health response to a pandemic., METHOD: The conceptual model and framework categorize informatics solutions that could be used by stakeholders (e.g., government, academic institutions, healthcare providers and payers, life science companies, employers, citizens) to address public health challenges across the prepare, respond, and recover phases of a pandemic, building on existing models for public health operations and response., RESULTS: Mapping existing solutions, technology assets, and ideas to the framework helped identify public health informatics solution requirements and gaps in responding to COVID-19 in areas such as applied science, epidemiology, communications, and business continuity. Two examples of technologies used in COVID-19 illustrate novel applications of informatics encompassed by the framework. First, we examine a hub from The Weather Channel, which provides COVID-19 data via interactive maps, trend graphs, and details on case data to individuals and businesses. Second, we examine IBM Watson Assistant for Citizens, an AI-powered virtual agent implemented by healthcare providers and payers, government agencies, and employers to provide information about COVID-19 via digital and telephone-based interaction., DISCUSSION: Early results from these novel informatics solutions have been positive, showing high levels of engagement and added value across stakeholders., CONCLUSION: The framework supports development, application, and evaluation of informatics approaches and technologies in support of public health preparedness, response, and recovery during a pandemic. Effective solutions are critical to success in recovery from COVID-19 and future pandemics. Copyright This is an Open Access article.

   journal = {Infection, Genetics and Evolution},
   volume = {113},
   pages = {105484},
   abstract = {Objectives: Clustering pathogen sequence data is a common practice in epidemiology to gain insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among pathogens. We can find groups of cases with a shared transmission history and common origin, as well as identifying transmission hotspots. Motivated by the experience of clustering SARS-CoV-2 cases using whole genome sequence data during the COVID-19 pandemic to aid with public health investigation, we investigated how differences in epidemiology and sampling can influence the composition of clusters that are identified. Method(s): We performed genomic clustering on simulated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks produced with different transmission rates and levels of genomic diversity, along with varying the proportion of cases sampled. Result(s): In single outbreaks with a low transmission rate, decreasing the sampling fraction resulted in multiple, separate clusters being identified where intermediate cases in transmission chains are missed. Outbreaks simulated with a high transmission rate were more robust to changes in the sampling fraction and largely resulted in a single cluster that included all sampled outbreak cases. When considering multiple outbreaks in a sampled jurisdiction seeded by different introductions, low genomic diversity between introduced cases caused outbreaks to be merged into large clusters. If the transmission and sampling fraction, and diversity between introductions was low, a combination of the spurious break-up of outbreaks and the linking of closely related cases in different outbreaks resulted in clusters that may appear informative, but these did not reflect the true underlying population structure. Conversely, genomic clusters matched the true population structure when there was relatively high diversity between introductions and a high transmission rate. Conclusion(s): Differences in epidemiology and sampling can impact our ability to identify genomic clusters that describe the underlying population structure. These findings can help to guide recommendations for the use of pathogen clustering in public health investigations.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread over the world rapidly creating one of the largest pandemics ever. The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value. We also estimate that the implementation of the latter a week earlier or later would have lead to a difference of about respectively -13k and +50k hospital deaths by the end of lock-down. The present parsimonious discrete-time framework constitutes a useful tool for now- and forecasting simultaneously community incidence and ICU capacity strain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a slum area under different interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free-running epidemic, we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viraemia reported in scientific studies. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62 000 cases (about a half of them confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the 'asymptomatic' cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

   pages = {100345},
   abstract = {Influenza is one of the main causes of death, not only in the USA but worldwide. Its significant economic and public health impacts necessitate development of accurate and efficient algorithms for forecasting of any upcoming influenza outbreaks. Most currently available methods for influenza prediction are based on parametric time series and regression models that impose restrictive and often unverifiable assumptions on the data. In turn, more flexible machine learning models and, particularly, deep learning tools whose utility is proven in a wide range of disciplines, remain largely under-explored in epidemiological forecasting. We study the seasonal influenza in Dallas County by evaluating the forecasting ability of deep learning with feedforward neural networks as well as performance of more conventional statistical models, such as beta regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operators (LASSO), and non-parametric multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models for one week and two weeks ahead forecasting. Furthermore, we assess forecasting utility of Google search queries and meteorological data as exogenous predictors of influenza activity. Finally, we develop a probabilistic forecasting of influenza in Dallas County by fusing all the considered models using Bayesian model averaging.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

   abstract = {Objective: To develop a SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection management system for Chinese residents under community grid management, which is supported by "health information technology" and "neural network image recognition", so as to give full play to the advantages of "grid management". This system is applied to the normalized prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic. Method(s): The model of image recognition algorithm was built based on deep learning and convolution neural network (CNN) artificial intelligence algorithm. The improved Canny edge detection algorithm was used to monitor and locate the image edge, and then the image segmentation and judgment value calculation were completed according to projection method. The system construction was completed combing with the grid number design. Result(s): The proposed method had been tested and showed the accuracy of the algorithm. With a certain robustness, the algorithm error was proved to be small. Based on the image recognition algorithm model, the development of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection management system covering user login, paper-strip test image upload, paper-strip test management, grid management, grid warning and regional traffic management was completed. Conclusion(s): Antigen detection is an important supplementary means of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in the new stage. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection management system for Chinese residents under community grid managemen based on image recognition enables mobile communication devices to recognize the image of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection results, which is helpful to form a grid management mode for the epidemic and improve the management framework of epidemic monitoring, detection, early warning and prevention and control.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {A key scientific challenge during the outbreak of novel infectious diseases is to predict how the course of the epidemic changes under countermeasures that limit interaction in the population. Most epidemiological models do not consider the role of mutations and heterogeneity in the type of contact events. However, pathogens have the capacity to mutate in response to changing environments, especially caused by the increase in population immunity to existing strains, and the emergence of new pathogen strains poses a continued threat to public health. Further, in the light of differing transmission risks in different congregate settings (e.g., schools and offices), different mitigation strategies may need to be adopted to control the spread of infection. We analyze a multilayer multistrain model by simultaneously accounting for i) pathways for mutations in the pathogen leading to the emergence of new pathogen strains, and ii) differing transmission risks in different settings, modeled as network layers. Assuming complete cross-immunity among strains, namely, recovery from any infection prevents infection with any other (an assumption that will need to be relaxed to deal with COVID-19 or influenza), we derive the key epidemiological parameters for the multilayer multistrain framework. We demonstrate that reductions to existing models that discount heterogeneity in either the strain or the network layers may lead to incorrect predictions. Our results highlight that the impact of imposing/lifting mitigation measures concerning different contact network layers (e.g., school closures or work-from-home policies) should be evaluated in connection with their effect on the likelihood of the emergence of new strains.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

   journal = {Scientific reports},
   volume = {12},

   pages = {16727},
   abstract = {The sudden spread of COVID-19 infections in a region can catch its healthcare system by surprise. Can one anticipate such a spread and allow healthcare administrators to prepare for a surge a priori? We posit that the answer lies in distinguishing between two types of waves in epidemic dynamics. The first kind resembles a spatio-temporal diffusion pattern. Its gradual spread allows administrators to marshal resources to combat the epidemic. The second kind is caused by super-spreader events, which provide shocks to the disease propagation dynamics. Such shocks simultaneously affect a large geographical region and leave little time for the healthcare system to respond. We use time-series analysis and epidemiological model estimation to detect and react to such simultaneous waves using COVID-19 data from the time when the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus dominated the spread. We first analyze India's second wave from April to May 2021 that overwhelmed the Indian healthcare system. Then, we analyze data of COVID-19 infections in the United States (US) and countries with a high and low Indian diaspora. We identify the Kumbh Mela festival as the likely super-spreader event, the exogenous shock, behind India's second wave. We show that a multi-area compartmental epidemiological model does not fit such shock-induced disease dynamics well, in contrast to its performance with diffusion-type spread. The insufficient fit to infection data can be detected in the early stages of a shock-wave propagation and can be used as an early warning sign, providing valuable time for a planned healthcare response. Our analysis of COVID-19 infections in the US reveals that simultaneous waves due to super-spreader events in one country (India) can lead to simultaneous waves in other places. The US wave in the summer of 2021 does not fit a diffusion pattern either. We postulate that international travels from India may have caused this wave. To support that hypothesis, we demonstrate that countries with a high Indian diaspora exhibit infection growth soon after India's second wave, compared to countries with a low Indian diaspora. Based on our data analysis, we provide concrete policy recommendations at various stages of a simultaneous wave, including how to avoid it, how to detect it quickly after a potential super-spreader event occurs, and how to proactively contain its spread.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {The role of epidemiological models is crucial for informing public health officials during a public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, traditional epidemiological models fail to capture the time-varying effects of mitigation strategies and do not account for under-reporting of active cases, thus introducing bias in the estimation of model parameters. To infer more accurate parameter estimates and to reduce the uncertainty of these estimates, we extend the SIR and SEIR epidemiological models with two time-varying parameters that capture the transmission rate and the rate at which active cases are reported to health officials. Using two real data sets of COVID-19 cases, we perform Bayesian inference via our SIR and SEIR models with time-varying transmission and reporting rates and via their standard counterparts with constant rates; our approach provides parameter estimates with more realistic interpretation, and 1-week ahead predictions with reduced uncertainty. Furthermore, we find consistent under-reporting in the number of active cases in the data that we consider, suggesting that the initial phase of the pandemic was more widespread than previously reported.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {(1) Background: A better understanding of COVID-19 dynamics in terms of interactions among individuals would be of paramount importance to increase the effectiveness of containment measures. Despite this, the research lacks spatiotemporal statistical and mathematical analysis based on large datasets. We describe a novel methodology to extract useful spatiotemporal information from COVID-19 pandemic data. (2) Methods: We perform specific analyses based on mathematical and statistical tools, like mathematical morphology, hierarchical clustering, parametric data modeling and non-parametric statistics. These analyses are here applied to the large dataset consisting of about 19,000 COVID-19 patients in the Veneto region (Italy) during the entire Italian national lockdown. (3) Results: We estimate the COVID-19 cumulative incidence spatial distribution, significantly reducing image noise. We identify four clusters of connected provinces based on the temporal evolution of the incidence. Surprisingly, while one cluster consists of three neighboring provinces, another one contains two provinces more than 210 km apart by highway. The survival function of the local spatial incidence values is modeled here by a tapered Pareto model, also used in other applied fields like seismology and economy in connection to networks. Model's parameters could be relevant to describe quantitatively the epidemic. (4) Conclusion(s): The proposed methodology can be applied to a general situation, potentially helping to adopt strategic decisions such as the restriction of mobility and gatherings.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

The need to inform policies and mitigation measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 highlights the need to understand the complex links between our daily activities and COVID-19 transmission that reflect the characteristics of British society. As a result of a partnership between academic and private sector researchers, we introduce a novel data driven modelling framework together with a computationally efficient approach to running complex simulation models of this type. We demonstrate the power and spatial flexibility of the framework to assess the effects of different interventions in a case study where the effects of the first UK national lockdown are estimated for the county of Devon. Here we find that an earlier lockdown is estimated to result in a lower peak in COVID-19 cases and 47% fewer infections overall during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. The framework we outline here will be crucial in gaining a greater understanding of the effects of policy interventions in different areas and within different populations.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

Detection-of-epidemic-start (detection), peak timing, and peak intensity were nowcasted. Detection displayed satisfactory performance in 2 of the 3 counties for all nonpandemic influenza seasons and in 6 of 9 seasons for the third county. Peak-timing prediction showed satisfactory performance from the influenza season 2011-12 onward. Peak-intensity prediction also was satisfactory for influenza seasons in 2 of the counties but poor in 1 county. Local influenza nowcasting was satisfactory for seasonal influenza in 2 of 3 counties. The less satisfactory performance in 1 of the study counties might be attributable to population mixing with a neighboring metropolitan area.Copyright © 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

   abstract = {COVID-19 has become a deadly pandemic in the recent times claiming millions of lives worldwide in a grievous manner. Most of the countries in the world have limited number of medical resources (hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.), and in the case of large outbreak, it becomes very difficult to provide treatment to every infected individual. In this study, we propound a mathematical model where we classify the infected into two subcategories-asymptomatic and symptomatic. This model further accounts for the effect of limited medical resource for infected people and using face masks in combating the pandemic. Focusing on these aspects, we analyze the model and exploit the available data for assessing the pattern in three most affected countries, namely USA, India and Brazil. The developed model is calibrated to fit data for these three countries and estimate the transmission rate of symptomatic, asymptomatic individuals. The rate at which the individuals who are quarantined recover is estimated as well. Along with these estimations, a comparative study based on the basic reproduction number estimated for the three countries is presented. Standard methods of sensitivity analysis are performed to analyze the ways in which basic reproduction number is impacted upon due to changes in different parameters of the model. Further, we obtain disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the model. It is observed that backward bifurcation occurs if the capacity of treatment is small and bistable equilibria are shown that makes the system more sensitive to the initial conditions. Sufficient conditions for the local asymptomatic stability of the endemic equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium of the system are obtained. The results of this study imply that to curb the severity of the increasing cases of the disease in these countries, effective strategies to control disease spread should be implemented so that the basic reproduction number can be decreased below the threshold value which is certainly less than unity. The use of protective masks in public is shown to be an important preventive measure to lower disease transmission rate. Also, the quantity of medical resources should increase so that every infected person can get better treatment.

   journal = {Applied soft computing},
   volume = {131},
   pages = {109750},
   abstract = {The pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the Coronavirus 2 disease in 2019, also known as SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19, has claimed over 5.6 million lives till now. The highly infectious nature of the Covid-19 virus has resulted into multiple massive upsurges in counts of new infections termed as 'waves.' These waves consist of numerous rising and falling counts of Covid-19 infection cases with changing dates that confuse analysts and researchers. Due to this confusion, the detection of emergence or drop of Covid waves is currently a subject of intensive research. Hence, we propose an algorithmic framework to forecast the upcoming details of Covid-19 infection waves for a region. The framework consists of a displaced double moving average ( delta DMA) algorithm for forecasting the start, rise, fall, and end of a Covid-19 wave. The forecast is generated by detection of potential dates with specific counts called 'markers.' This detection of markers is guided by decision rules generated through rough set theory. We also propose a novel 'corrected moving average' ( chi SMA) technique to forecast the upcoming count of new infections in a region. We implement our proposed framework on a database of Covid-19 infection specifics fetched from 12 countries, namely: Argentina, Colombia, New Zealand, Australia, Cuba, Jamaica, Belgium, Croatia, Libya, Kenya, Iran, and Myanmar. The database consists of day-wise time series of new and total infection counts from the date of first case till 31st January 2022 in each of the countries mentioned above. The delta DMA algorithm outperforms other baseline techniques in forecasting the rise and fall of Covid-19 waves with a forecast precision of 94.08%. The chi SMA algorithm also surpasses its counterparts in predicting the counts of new Covid-19 infections for the next day with the least mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 36.65%. Our proposed framework can be deployed to forecast the upcoming trends and counts of new Covid-19 infection cases under a minimum observation window of 7 days with high accuracy. With no perceptible impact of countermeasures on the pandemic until now, these forecasts will prove supportive to the administration and medical bodies in scaling and allotment of medical infrastructure and healthcare facilities.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, originating in Wuhan, China, was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations., OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to study how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to government policies and to analyze how different policies have produced different results on public health., METHODS: Considering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by each government, we built an agent-based model to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case-fatality rates. The model we implemented provides the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (eg, keeping the national borders closed or increasing the ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection., RESULTS: The 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for COVID-19, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual second wave, while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is also reflected in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths., CONCLUSIONS: In line with what we expected, the obtained results showed that the countries that have taken restrictive measures in terms of limiting the population mobility have managed more successfully than others to contain the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the model demonstrated that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries that have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.

   abstract = {Several determinants are suspected to be causal drivers for new cases of COVID-19 infection. Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated the effects of the most prominent determining factors on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy) or within residential areas, and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases for public mobility in retail and recreational areas or workplaces, awareness measured by searches for "corona" in Google, higher rainfall, and some socio-demographic factors. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were found to be effective in reducing case numbers. This comprehensive causal graph analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.},

   abstract = {Here, we combine international air travel passenger data with a standard epidemiological model of the initial 3 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through March 2020; toward the end of which the entire world locked down). Using the information available during this initial phase of the pandemic, our model accurately describes the main features of the actual global development of the pandemic demonstrated by the high degree of coherence between the model and global data. The validated model allows for an exploration of alternative policy efficacies (reducing air travel and/or introducing different degrees of compulsory immigration quarantine upon arrival to a country) in delaying the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and thus is suggestive of similar efficacy in anticipating the spread of future global disease outbreaks. We show that a lesson from the recent pandemic is that reducing air travel globally is more effective in reducing the global spread than adopting immigration quarantine. Reducing air travel out of a source country has the most important effect regarding the spreading of the disease to the rest of the world. Based upon our results, we propose a digital twin as a further developed tool to inform future pandemic decision-making to inform measures intended to control the spread of disease agents of potential future pandemics. We discuss the design criteria for such a digital twin model as well as the feasibility of obtaining access to the necessary online data on international air travel.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

   abstract = {Although the health care systems in Europe are considered the global benchmark, European nations were severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This manuscript aimed to examine the strategies implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Russia and their outcomes in terms of the number of cases, testing, and deaths. This is the first review of its kind that extensively analyzes the preparedness, mitigation, and response strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic adopted by these nations. This paper further suggests a strategic preparedness model for future pandemics. From the analysis, we found that a decentralized approach, prompt decision-making and timely execution, coordination between local health authorities, and public participation in the implementation of strategies could substantially reduce the case fatality rate. Nations with a high percentage of gross domestic product invested in the health sector, as well as more nurses, physicians, hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators, better managed the pandemic. Instead, nations that postponed their pandemic response by delaying tracking, tracing, testing, quarantine, and lockdown were badly affected. The lessons learned from the present pandemic could be used as a guide to prepare for further pandemics.},

   abstract = {Outbreaks of African filoviruses often have high mortality, including more than 11,000 deaths among 28,562 cases during the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. Numerous studies have investigated the factors that contributed to individual filovirus outbreaks, but there has been little quantitative synthesis of this work. In addition, the ways in which the typical causes of filovirus outbreaks differ from other zoonoses remain poorly described. In this study, we quantify factors associated with 45 outbreaks of African filoviruses (ebolaviruses and Marburg virus) using a rubric of 48 candidate causal drivers. For filovirus outbreaks, we reviewed >700 peer-reviewed and gray literature sources and developed a list of the factors reported to contribute to each outbreak (i.e., a "driver profile"for each outbreak). We compare and contrast the profiles of filovirus outbreaks to 200 background outbreaks, randomly selected from a global database of 4463 outbreaks of bacterial and viral zoonotic diseases. We also test whether the quantitative patterns that we observed were robust to the influences of six covariates, country-level factors such as gross domestic product, population density, and latitude that have been shown to bias global outbreak data. We find that, regardless of whether covariates are included or excluded from models, the driver profile of filovirus outbreaks differs from that of background outbreaks. Socioeconomic factors such as trade and travel, wild game consumption, failures of medical procedures, and deficiencies in human health infrastructure were more frequently reported in filovirus outbreaks than in the comparison group. Based on our results, we also present a review of drivers reported in at least 10% of filovirus outbreaks, with examples of each provided.© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Epidemics pose a significant risk for human and economic losses, yet this risk is challenging to quantify. Current methods for assessing epidemic risk are typically based on observational data, which are often sparse and incomplete. Global simulation models of infectious disease spread allow us to simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of hypothetical epidemic scenarios. Sovereign nations in Africa are at risk of experiencing filovirus epidemics, which can have devastating financial impacts. These models can help fill in the gaps in observational data and provide a clearer picture of epidemic risk. Methods & Materials: We used a stochastic epidemic model to simulate over 200,000 filovirus epidemics, with varying initial parameters and differing availability and efficacy of intervention measures. Probability distributions of model parameters such as spark location, transmissibility, and case-fatality ratio were derived from the primary literature and historic case data. We constructed an event catalog by selecting simulated events using a sampling algorithm that accounted for the joint probability of each parameter combination for each scenario and the inter-arrival time distribution between filovirus epidemics. The event catalog was then used to generate exceedance probability metrics, which estimate the likelihood of observing an event of a given severity (e.g., expected deaths), or worse, in any given year. Result(s): Based on our analysis, there is a 1.5% probability that a filovirus epidemic similar to or worse than the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic (based on global deaths) will occur in any given year. The countries that are predicted to most commonly experience filovirus epidemics (at least one infection that either originated in the country or was imported) were Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia, and Uganda. We estimate that Democratic Republic of the Congo has a 31% annual probability of having at least one filovirus-infected individual. Conclusion(s): Probabilistic modeling and stochastic simulations are powerful tools to quantify epidemic risk. With these risk metrics, organizations such as the African Risk Capacity, a specialized agency of the African Union, can work with sovereign nations on coordinated preparedness assessment, contingency planning, and risk modeling to equip them with the financial resources needed to respond to an epidemic.Copyright © 2018},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, the Caribbean region has been challenged by compound climate and health hazards, including tropical storms, extreme heat and droughts and overlapping epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Early warning systems (EWS) are a key climate change adaptation strategy for the health sector. An EWS can integrate climate information in forecasting models to predict the risk of disease outbreaks several weeks or months in advance. In this article, we share our experiences of co-learning during the process of co-creating a dengue EWS for the health sector in Barbados, and we discuss barriers to implementation as well as key opportunities. This process has involved bringing together health and climate practitioners with transdisciplinary researchers to jointly identify needs and priorities, assess available data, co-create an early warning tool, gather feedback via national and regional consultations and conduct trainings. Implementation is ongoing and our team continues to be committed to a long-term process of collaboration. Developing strong partnerships, particularly between the climate and health sectors in Barbados, has been a critical part of the research and development. In many countries, the national climate and health sectors have not worked together in a sustained or formal manner. This collaborative process has purposefully pushed us out of our comfort zone, challenging us to venture beyond our institutional and disciplinary silos. Through the co-creation of the EWS, we anticipate that the Barbados health system will be better able to mainstream climate information into decision-making processes using tailored tools, such as epidemic forecast reports, risk maps and climate-health bulletins, ultimately increasing the resilience of the health system.Copyright ©},

   abstract = {Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0) for COVID-19 are particularly variable in the context of transmission within locations such as long-term healthcare (LTHC) facilities. We sought to characterize the heterogeneity of R 0 across known outbreaks within these facilities. We used a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that occurred within LTHC facilities in British Columbia, Canada as of 21 September 2020. We estimated R 0 in 18 LTHC outbreaks with a novel Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals, incorporating heterogeneity of R 0 between facilities. We further compared these estimates to those obtained with standard methods that use the exponential growth rate and maximum likelihood. The total size of outbreaks varied dramatically, with range of attack rates 2%-86%. The Bayesian analysis provided an overall estimate of R 0 = 2.51 (90% credible interval 0.47-9.0), with individual facility estimates ranging between 0.56 and 9.17. Uncertainty in these estimates was more constrained than standard methods, particularly for smaller outbreaks informed by the population-level model. We further estimated that intervention led to 61% (52%-69%) of all potential cases being averted within the LTHC facilities, or 75% (68%-79%) when using a model with multi-level intervention effect. Understanding of transmission risks and impact of intervention are essential in planning during the ongoing global pandemic, particularly in high-risk environments such as LTHC facilities.

   abstract = {Genomic technologies have led to tremendous gains in understanding how pathogens function, evolve and interact. Pathogen diversity is now measurable at high precision and resolution, in part because over the past decade, sequencing technologies have increased in speed and capacity, at decreased cost. Alongside this, the use of models that can forecast emergence and size of infectious disease outbreaks has risen, highlighted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic but also due to modelling advances that allow for rapid estimates in emerging outbreaks to inform monitoring, coordination and resource deployment. However, genomics studies have remained largely retrospective. While they contain high-resolution views of pathogen diversification and evolution in the context of selection, they are often not aligned with designing interventions. This is a missed opportunity because pathogen diversification is at the core of the most pressing infectious public health challenges, and interventions need to take the mechanisms of virulence and understanding of pathogen diversification into account. In this Perspective, we assess these converging fields, discuss current challenges facing both surveillance specialists and modellers who want to harness genomic data, and propose next steps for integrating longitudinally sampled genomic data with statistical learning and interpretable modelling to make reliable predictions into the future.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted delayed reporting as a significant impediment to effective disease surveillance and decision-making. In the absence of timely data, statistical models which account for delays can be adopted to nowcast and forecast cases or deaths. We discuss the four key sources of systematic and random variability in available data for COVID-19 and other diseases, and critically evaluate current state-of-the-art methods with respect to appropriately separating and capturing this variability. We propose a general hierarchical approach to correcting delayed reporting of COVID-19 and apply this to daily English hospital deaths, resulting in a flexible prediction tool which could be used to better inform pandemic decision-making. We compare this approach to competing models with respect to theoretical flexibility and quantitative metrics from a 15-month rolling prediction experiment imitating a realistic operational scenario. Based on consistent leads in predictive accuracy, bias, and precision, we argue that this approach is an attractive option for correcting delayed reporting of COVID-19 and future epidemics.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {The opioid crisis presents substantial challenges to public health in New England's rural states, where access to pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (OUD), harm reduction, HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) services vary widely. We present an approach to characterizing the epidemiology, policy and resource environment for OUD and its consequences, with a focus on eleven rural counties in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont between 2014 and 2018. We developed health policy summaries and logic models to facilitate comparison of opioid epidemic-related polices across the three states that could influence the risk environment and access to services. We assessed sociodemographic factors, rates of overdose and infectious complications tied to OUD, and drive-time access to prevention and treatment resources. We developed GIS maps and conducted spatial analyses to assess the opioid crisis landscape. Through collaborative research, we assessed the potential impact of available resources to address the opioid crisis in rural New England. Vermont's comprehensive set of policies and practices for drug treatment and harm reduction appeared to be associated with the lowest fatal overdose rates. Franklin County, Massachusetts had good access to naloxone, drug treatment and SSPs, but relatively high overdose and HIV rates. New Hampshire had high proportions of uninsured community members, the highest overdose rates, no HCV surveillance data, and no local access to SSPs. This combination of factors appeared to place PWID in rural New Hampshire at elevated risk. Study results facilitated the development of vulnerability indicators, identification of locales for subsequent data collection, and public health interventions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

   abstract = {Importance: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility rates has been suggested in the lay press and anticipated based on documented decreases in fertility and pregnancy rates during previous major societal and economic shifts. Anticipatory planning for birth rates is important for health care systems and government agencies to accurately estimate size of economy and model working and/or aging populations. Objective(s): To use projection modeling based on electronic health care records in a large US university medical center to estimate changes in pregnancy and birth rates prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic societal lockdowns. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included all pregnancy episodes within a single US academic health care system retrospectively from 2017 and modeled prospectively to 2021. Data were analyzed September 2021. Exposures: Pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was number of new pregnancy episodes initiated within the health care system and use of those episodes to project birth volumes. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the degree to which COVID-19 societal changes may have factored into pregnancy episode volume. Potential reasons for the changes in volumes were compared with historical pregnancy volumes, including delays in starting prenatal care, interruptions in reproductive endocrinology and infertility services, and preterm birth rates. Result(s): This cohort study documented a steadily increasing number of pregnancy episodes over the study period, from 4100 pregnancies in 2017 to 4620 in 2020 (28284 total pregnancies; median maternal [interquartile range] age, 30 [27-34] years; 18728 [66.2%] White women, 3794 [13.4%] Black women; 2177 [7.7%] Asian women). A 14% reduction in pregnancy episode initiation was observed after the societal shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P <.001). This decrease appeared to be due to a decrease in conceptions that followed the March 15 mandated COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown. Prospective modeling of pregnancies currently suggests that a birth volume surge can be anticipated in summer 2021. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study using electronic medical record surveillance found an initial decline in births associated with the COVID-19 pandemic societal changes and an anticipated increase in birth volume. Future studies can further explore how pregnancy episode volume changes can be monitored and birth rates projected in real-time during major societal events..Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

   abstract = {Background UNAIDS has established new program targets for 2025 to achieve : the goal of eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. This study reports on efforts to use mathematical models to estimate the impact of achieving those targets. Methods and findings We simulated the impact of achieving the targets at country level using the Goals model, a mathematical simulation model of HIV epidemic dynamics that includes the impact of prevention and treatment interventions. For 77 high-burden countries, we fit the model to surveillance and survey data for 1970 to 2020 and then projected the impact of achieving the targets for the period 2019 to 2030. Results from these 77 countries were extrapolated to produce estimates for 96 others. Goals model results were checked by comparing against projections done with the Optima HIV model and the AIDS Epidemic Model (AEM) for selected countries. We included estimates of the impact of societal enablers (access to justice and law reform, stigma and discrimination elimination, and gender equality) and the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results show that achieving the 2025 targets would reduce new annual infections by 83% (71% to 86% across regions) and AIDS-related deaths by 78% (67% to 81% across regions) by 2025 compared to 2010. Lack of progress on societal enablers could endanger these achievements and result in as many as 2.6 million (44%) cumulative additional new HIV infections and 440,000 (54%) more AIDS-related deaths between 2020 and 2030 compared to full achievement of all targets. COVID-19-related disruptions could increase new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths by 10% in the next 2 years, but targets could still be achieved by 2025. Study limitations include the reliance on self-reports for most data on behaviors, the use of intervention effect sizes from published studies that may overstate intervention impacts outside of controlled study settings, and the use of proxy countries to estimate the impact in countries with fewer than 4,000 annual HIV infections. Conclusions The new targets for 2025 build on the progress made since 2010 and represent ambitious short-term goals. Achieving these targets would bring us close to the goals of reducing new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths by 90% between 2010 and 2030. By 2025, global piledforthoseusedthroughoutthetext new infections and AIDS:Pleaseverifythatallentriesarecorrect deaths would drop to 4.4 and : 3.9 per 100,000 population, and the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) would be declining. There would be 32 million people on treatment, and they would need continuing support for their lifetime. Incidence for the total global population would be below 0.15% everywhere. The number of PLHIV would start declining by 2023.Copyright © 2021 Stover et al.

I develop a behavioral dynamic epidemic model for multifaceted policy analysis comprising endogenous virus transmission (from severe or mild/asymptomatic cases), social contacts, and case testing and reporting. Calibration of the system dynamics model to the ongoing outbreak (31 December 2019-15 May 2020) using multiple time series data (reported cases and deaths, performed tests, and social interaction proxies) from six countries (South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, and the United States) informs an explanatory analysis of outbreak responses and postpeak strategies. Specifically, I demonstrate, first, how timing and efforts of testing-capacity expansion and social-contact reduction interplay to affect outbreak dynamics and can explain a large share of cross-country variation in outbreak pathways. Second, absent at-scale availability of pharmaceutical solutions, postpeak social contacts must remain well below prepandemic values. Third, proactive (targeted) interventions, when complementing general deconfinement readiness, can considerably increase admissible postpeak social contacts. © 2020 System Dynamics Society.

   abstract = {Nowadays, global public health crises are occurring more frequently, and accurate prediction of these diseases can reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Taking COVID-19 as an example, accurate prediction of infection can assist experts in effectively allocating medical resources and diagnosing diseases. Currently, scholars worldwide use single model approaches or epidemiology models more often to predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. Although a few studies have employed ensemble models, there is still room for improvement in their performance. In addition, there are only a few models that use the laboratory results of patients to predict COVID-19 infection. To address these issues, research efforts should focus on improving disease prediction performance and expanding the use of medical disease prediction models. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning model Whale Optimization Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) called WOCLSA which incorporates three models ANN, CNN and LSTM. The WOCLSA model utilizes the Whale Optimization Algorithm to optimize the neuron number, dropout and batch size parameters in the integrated model of ANN, CNN and LSTM, thereby finding the global optimal solution parameters. WOCLSA employs 18 patient indicators as predictors, and compares its results with three other ensemble deep learning models. All models were validated with train-test split approaches. We evaluate and compare our proposed model and other models using accuracy, F1 score, recall, AUC and precision metrics. Through many studies and tests, our results show that our prediction models can identify patients with COVID-19 infection at the AUC of 91%, 91%, and 93% respectively. Other prediction results achieve a respectable accuracy of 92.82%, 92.79%, and 91.66% respectively, f1-score of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, precision of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, recall of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively. All of these exceed 91%, surpassing those of comparable models. The execution time of WOCLSA is also an advantage. Therefore, the WOCLSA ensemble model can be used to assist in verifying laboratory research results and predict and to judge various diseases in public health events.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Effective public health measures must balance potentially conflicting demands from populations they serve. In the case of infectious disease risks from mosquito-borne infections, such as Zika virus, public concern about the pathogen may be counterbalanced by public concern about environmental contamination from chemical agents used for vector control. Here we introduce a generic framework for modeling how the spread of an infectious pathogen might lead to varying public perceptions, and therefore tolerance, of both disease risk and pesticide use. We consider how these dynamics might impact the spread of a vector-borne disease. We tailor and parameterize our model for direct application to Zika virus as spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, though the framework itself has broad applicability to any arboviral infection. We demonstrate how public risk perception of both disease and pesticides may drastically impact the spread of a mosquito-borne disease in a susceptible population. We conclude that models hoping to inform public health decision making about how best to mitigate arboviral disease risks should explicitly consider the potential public demand for, or rejection of, chemical control of mosquito populations.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {Since the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak at the end of 2019, many studies regarding the impact of meteorological factors on the attack have been carried out, and inconsistent conclusions have been reached, indicating the issue's complexity. To more accurately identify the effects and patterns of meteorological factors on the epidemic, we used a combination of logistic regression (LgR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling to investigate the possible effects of common meteorological factors, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and surface pressure, on the transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our analysis shows that: (1) Different countries and regions show spatial heterogeneity in the number of diagnosed patients of the epidemic, but this can be roughly classified into three types: "continuous growth", "staged shock", and "finished"; (2) Air temperature is the most significant meteorological factor influencing the transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic. Except for a few areas, regional air temperature changes and the transmission of the epidemic show a significant positive correlation, i.e., an increase in air temperature is conducive to the spread of the epidemic; (3) In different countries and regions studied, wind speed, relative humidity, and surface pressure show inconsistent correlation (and significance) with the number of diagnosed cases but show some regularity.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {In the midst of an outbreak or sustained epidemic, reliable prediction of transmission risks and patterns of spread is critical to inform public health programs. Projections of transmission growth or decline among specific risk groups can aid in optimizing interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees have been widely used in the detection of transmission chains and high-risk populations. Moreover, tree topology and the incorporation of population parameters (phylodynamics) can be useful in reconstructing the evolutionary dynamics of an epidemic across space and time among individuals. We now demonstrate the utility of phylodynamic trees for transmission modeling and forecasting, developing a phylogeny-based deep learning system, referred to as DeepDynaForecast. Our approach leverages a primal-dual graph learning structure with shortcut multi-layer aggregation, which is suited for the early identification and prediction of transmission dynamics in emerging high-risk groups. We demonstrate the accuracy of DeepDynaForecast using simulated outbreak data and the utility of the learned model using empirical, large-scale data from the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic in Florida between 2012 and 2020.

   journal = {BMC Medicine},
   volume = {18},

   pages = {399},
   abstract = {Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global epidemic in 2015-2016 from Latin America with its true geographical extent remaining unclear due to widely presumed underreporting. The identification of locations with potential and unknown spread of ZIKV is a key yet understudied component for outbreak preparedness. Here, we aim to identify locations at a high risk of cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015-2016 to further the understanding of the global ZIKV epidemiology, which is critical for the mitigation of the risk of future epidemics. Method(s): We developed an importation simulation model to estimate the weekly number of ZIKV infections imported in each susceptible spatial unit (i.e. location that did not report any autochthonous Zika cases during 2015-2016), integrating epidemiological, demographic, and travel data as model inputs. Thereafter, a global risk model was applied to estimate the weekly ZIKV transmissibility during 2015-2016 for each location. Finally, we assessed the risk of onward ZIKV spread following importation in each susceptible spatial unit to identify locations with a high potential for cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015-2016. Result(s): We have found 24 susceptible spatial units that were likely to have experienced cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015-2016, of which 10 continue to have a high risk estimate within a highly conservative scenario, namely, Luanda in Angola, Banten in Indonesia, Maharashtra in India, Lagos in Nigeria, Taiwan and Guangdong in China, Dakar in Senegal, Maputo in Mozambique, Kinshasa in Congo DRC, and Pool in Congo. Notably, among the 24 susceptible spatial units identified, some have reported their first ZIKV outbreaks since 2017, thus adding to the credibility of our results (derived using 2015-2016 data only). Conclusion(s): Our study has provided valuable insights into the potentially high-risk locations for cryptic ZIKV circulation during the 2015-2016 pandemic and has also laid a foundation for future studies that attempt to further narrow this key knowledge gap. Our modelling framework can be adapted to identify areas with likely unknown spread of other emerging vector-borne diseases, which has important implications for public health readiness especially in resource-limited settings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

   pages = {102450},
   abstract = {Complexities of virus genotypes and the stochastic contacts in human society create a big challenge for estimating the potential risks of exposure to a widely spreading virus such as COVID-19. To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020. The correlation experiment with the new cases in the next two weeks shows that the risk estimation model offers promise in assisting people to be more precise about their personal safety and control of daily routine and social interaction. It can inform business and municipal COVID-19 policy to accelerate recovery.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The basic reproductive number (R0) is a function of contact rates among individuals, transmission probability, and duration of infectiousness. We sought to determine the association between population density and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. counties. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0, and controlled for state-level effects using random intercepts. We also assessed whether the association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation percentage as a proxy for transportation accessibility, and adjusted for median household income. The median R0 among the United States counties was 1.66 (IQR: 1.35-2.11). A population density threshold of 22 people/km2 was needed to sustain an outbreak. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. An increase in one unit of log population density increased R0 by 0.16 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.19). This association remained when adjusted for main mode of transportation and household income. The effect of population density on R0 was not modified by transportation mode. Our findings suggest that dense areas increase contact rates necessary for disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 R0 estimates need to consider this geographic variability for proper planning and resource allocation, particularly as epidemics newly emerge and old outbreaks resurge.},

   pages = {103852},
   abstract = {Background: Development and dissemination of public health (PH) guidance to healthcare organizations and the general public (e.g., businesses, schools, individuals) during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic is vital for policy, clinical, and public decision-making. Yet, the rapidly evolving nature of these events poses significant challenges for guidance development and dissemination strategies predicated on well-understood concepts and clearly defined access and distribution pathways. Taxonomies are an important but underutilized tool for guidance authoring, dissemination and updating in such dynamic scenarios. Objective(s): To design a rapid, semi-automated method for sampling and developing a PH guidance taxonomy using widely available Web crawling tools and streamlined manual content analysis. Method(s): Iterative samples of guidance documents were taken from four state PH agency websites, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Documents were used to derive and refine a preliminary taxonomy of COVID-19 PH guidance via content analysis. Result(s): Eight iterations of guidance document sampling and taxonomy revisions were performed, with a final corpus of 226 documents. The preliminary taxonomy contains 110 branches distributed between three major domains: stakeholders (24 branches), settings (25 branches) and topics (61 branches). Thematic saturation measures indicated rapid saturation (<=5% change) for the domains of "stakeholders" and "settings", and "topic"-related branches for clinical decision-making. Branches related to business reopening and economic consequences remained dynamic throughout sampling iterations. Conclusion(s): The PH guidance taxonomy can support public health agencies by aligning guidance development with curation and indexing strategies; supporting targeted dissemination; increasing the speed of updates; and enhancing public-facing guidance repositories and information retrieval tools. Taxonomies are essential to support knowledge management activities during rapidly evolving scenarios such as disease outbreaks and natural disasters.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is causing devastating demographic, social, and economic damage globally. Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Mathematical modeling of epidemiological diseases using differential equations are of great importance in order to recognize the characteristics of the diseases and their outbreak. The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1 at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated the importance of using models to understand, predict, and manage epidemics, in particular by assessing in advance the effect of different intervention policies. Numerous models have been proposed to answer a wide range of questions, from the impact of open borders to the effectiveness of neighborhood containment to the role of building ventilation in virus dispersion. However, the vast majority of these models are only suited to a scale of representation, analysis, or experimentation. In this article, we present the latest version of the COMOKIT toolbox, which is based on the integration of 3 models (COMOKIT-micro, COMOKIT-meso, and COMOKIT-macro) enabling these questions to be addressed at different geographical scales of analysis and exploration, from the building scale to the scale of entire countries. An application of these 3 models to various questions concerning public health policies against COVID-19 is presented and discussed.Copyright © 2024 Taillandier et al.

   title = {Stochastic modelling for predicting COVID-19 prevalence in East Africa Countries},
   journal = {Infectious Disease Modelling},
   volume = {5},
   pages = {598-607},
   abstract = {Coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued to be a global threat to public health. As the matter of fact, it needs unreserved effort to monitor the prevalence of the virus. However, applying an effective prediction of the prevalence is thought to be the fundamental requirement to effectively control the spreading rate. Time series models have extensively been considered as the convenient methods to predict the prevalence or spreading rate of the disease. This study, therefore, aimed to apply the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling approach for projecting coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence patterns in East Africa Countries, mainly Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. The data for the study were obtained from the reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases by the official website of Johns Hopkins University from 13th March, 2020 to 30th June, 2020.The results of the study, then, showed that in the coming four month, the number of COVID-19 positive people in Ethiopia may reach up to 56,610 from 5,846 on June 30, 2020 in average-rate scenario. However, in worst case scenario forecast, the model showed that the cases will be around 84,497. The analysis further depicted that with average interventions and control scenario, cumulative number of infected persons in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan will increase from 4,656, 2,904 and 9,258 respectively at the end of June to 8,336, 3,961 and 21,388, which is by the end of October, 2020, after four-months. But, with insufficient intervention, the number of infected persons may grow quickly and reach up to 14,072, 10,037 and 38,174 in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan respectively. Generally, the extent of the coronavirus spreading was increased from time to time in the past four month, until 30 th June, 2020, and it is expected to continue quicker than before for the coming 4-month, until the end of October, 2020, in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Sudan and more rapidly than before in Sudan and Ethiopia, while the peak will remain unknown yet. Therefore, an effective implementation of the preventive measures and a rigorous compliance by avoiding negligence with the rules such as prohibiting public gatherings, travel restrictions, personal protection measures, and social distancing may alleviate the spreading rates of the virus, particularly, Sudan and Ethiopia. Moreover, more efforts should be exerted on Ethiopian side to control the population movement across all the border areas and to strengthen border quarantining. Further, through updating more new data with continuous reconsideration of predictive model, provide useful and more precise prediction.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Describing transmission dynamics of the outbreak and impact of intervention measures are critical to planning responses to future outbreaks and providing timely information to guide policy makers decision. We estimate serial interval (SI) and temporal reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia., METHODS: We collected data of investigations and contact tracing between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020 as well as illness onset data during the period February 29-May 5, 2020 from National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases of Tunisia. Maximum likelihood (ML) approach is used to estimate dynamics of Rt., RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-one of infector-infectee pairs were involved, with 14.46% reported pre-symptomatic transmission. SI follows Gamma distribution with mean 5.30 days [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.66-5.95] and standard deviation 0.26 [95% CI 0.23-0.30]. Also, we estimated large changes in Rt in response to the combined lockdown interventions. The Rt moves from 3.18 [95% Credible Interval (CrI) 2.73-3.69] to 1.77 [95% CrI 1.49-2.08] with curfew prevention measure, and under the epidemic threshold (0.89 [95% CrI 0.84-0.94]) by national lockdown measure., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings highlight contribution of interventions to interrupt transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia.},

   abstract = {Estimation of age-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 patients is critical for effective policymaking. Although the transmissibility of symptomatic cases has been extensively studied, asymptomatic infection is understudied due to limited data. Using a dataset with reliably distinguished symptomatic and asymptomatic statuses of COVID-19 cases, we propose an ordinary differential equation model that considers age-dependent transmissibility in transmission dynamics. Under a Bayesian framework, multi-source information is synthesized in our model for identifying transmissibility. A shrinkage prior among age groups is also adopted to improve the estimation behavior of transmissibility from age-structured data. The added values of accounting for age-dependent transmissibility are further evaluated through simulation studies. In real-data analysis, we compare our approach with two basic models using the deviance information criterion (DIC) and its extension. We find that the proposed model is more flexible for our epidemic data. Our results also suggest that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections is significantly lower (on average, 76.45% with a credible interval (27.38%, 88.65%)) than that of symptomatic cases. In both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the transmissibility mainly increases with age. Patients older than 30 years are more likely to develop symptoms with higher transmissibility. We also find that the transmission burden of asymptomatic cases is lower than that of symptomatic patients.Copyright © 2022 The International Biometric Society.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, more than 20 million cases have been reported, as of Aug 24, 2020. This study aimed to identify what the additional health-care costs of a strategic preparedness and response plan (SPRP) would be if current transmission levels are maintained in a status quo scenario, or under scenarios where transmission is increased or decreased by 50%., METHODS: The number of COVID-19 cases was projected for 73 low-income and middle-income countries for each of the three scenarios for both 4-week and 12-week timeframes, starting from June 26, 2020. An input-based approach was used to estimate the additional health-care costs associated with human resources, commodities, and capital inputs that would be accrued in implementing the SPRP., FINDINGS: The total cost estimate for the COVID-19 response in the status quo scenario was US$52.45 billion over 4 weeks, at $8.60 per capita. For the decreased or increased transmission scenarios, the totals were $33.08 billion and $61.92 billion, respectively. Costs would triple under the status quo and increased transmission scenarios at 12 weeks. The costs of the decreased transmission scenario over 12 weeks was equivalent to the cost of the status quo scenario at 4 weeks. By percentage of the overall cost, case management (54%), maintaining essential services (21%), rapid response and case investigation (14%), and infection prevention and control (9%) were the main cost drivers., INTERPRETATION: The sizeable costs of a COVID-19 response in the health sector will escalate, particularly if transmission increases. Instituting early and comprehensive measures to limit the further spread of the virus will conserve resources and sustain the response., FUNDING: WHO, and UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high until March 2nd Moreover our model-based analysis shows that the COVID-19 epidemics in South Korean is almost under control with the cumulative confirmed cases tending to be stable as of April 14th. Through sensitivity analysis, we show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and especially its provinces outside its epicenter. In comparison, we find that the extremely high detection rate is the key factor determining the success in controlling the COVID-19 epidemics in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China and South Korea should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world.Copyright © 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We propose herein a mathematical model to predict the COVID-19 evolution and evaluate the impact of governmental decisions on this evolution, attempting to explain the long duration of the pandemic in the 26 Brazilian states and their capitals well as in the Federative Unit. The prediction was performed based on the growth rate of new cases in a stable period, and the graphics plotted with the significant governmental decisions to evaluate the impact on the epidemic curve in each Brazilian state and city. Analysis of the predicted new cases was correlated with the total number of hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19. Because Brazil is a vast country, with high heterogeneity and complexity of the regional/local characteristics and governmental authorities among Brazilian states and cities, we individually predicted the epidemic curve based on a specific stable period with reduced or minimal interference on the growth rate of new cases. We found good accuracy, mainly in a short period (weeks). The most critical governmental decisions had a significant temporal impact on pandemic curve growth. A good relationship was found between the predicted number of new cases and the total number of inpatients and deaths related to COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that interventional and preventive measures directly and significantly impact the COVID-19 pandemic using a simple mathematical model. This model can easily be applied, helping, and directing health and governmental authorities to make further decisions to combat the pandemic.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Colombia announced the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on March 6, 2020. Since then, the country has reported a total of 5,002,387 cases and 127,258 deaths as of October 31, 2021. The aggressive transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 motivate an investigation of COVID-19 at the national and regional levels in Colombia. We utilize the case incidence and mortality data to estimate the transmission potential and gen-erate short-term forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic to inform the public health policies using previously validated mathematical models. The analysis is augmented by the examination of geographic heterogeneity of COVID-19 at the departmental level along with the investigation of mobility and social media trends. Overall, the national and regional reproduction numbers show sustained disease transmission during the early phase of the pan-demic, exhibiting sub-exponential growth dynamics. Whereas the most recent estimates of reproduction number indicate disease containment, with Rt<1.0 as of October 31, 2021. On the forecasting front, the sub-epidemic model performs best at capturing the 30-day ahead COVID-19 trajectory compared to the Richards and generalized logistic growth model. Nev-ertheless, the spatial variability in the incidence rate patterns across different departments can be grouped into four distinct clusters. As the case incidence surged in July 2020, an increase in mobility patterns was also observed. On the contrary, a spike in the number of tweets indicating the stay-at-home orders was observed in November 2020 when the case incidence had already plateaued, indicating the pandemic fatigue in the country.Copyright © 2022.},

   abstract = {The pandemic has significantly affected many countries including the USA, UK, Asia, the Middle East and Africa region, and many other countries. Similarly, it has substantially affected Malaysia, making it crucial to develop efficient and precise forecasting tools for guiding public health policies and approaches. Our study is based on advanced deep-learning models to predict the SARS-CoV-2 cases. We evaluate the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN-LSTM, Multilayer Perceptron, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We trained these models and assessed them using a detailed dataset of confirmed cases, demographic data, and pertinent socio-economic factors. Our research aims to determine the most reliable and accurate model for forecasting SARS-CoV-2 cases in the region. We were able to test and optimize deep learning models to predict cases, with each model displaying diverse levels of accuracy and precision. A comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance discloses the most appropriate architecture for Malaysia's specific situation. This study supports ongoing efforts to combat the pandemic by offering valuable insights into the application of sophisticated deep-learning models for precise and timely SARS-CoV-2 case predictions. The findings hold considerable implications for public health decision-making, empowering authorities to create targeted and data-driven interventions to limit the virus's spread and minimize its effects on Malaysia's population.Copyright © 2023 Tariq et al.

   title = {Evaluating the sensitivity of jurisdictional heterogeneity and jurisdictional mixing in national level HIV prevention analyses: context of the U.S. ending the HIV epidemic plan},
   journal = {BMC medical research methodology},
   volume = {22},
   number = {1},
   pages = {304},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The U.S. Ending the HIV epidemic (EHE) plan aims to reduce annual HIV incidence by 90% by 2030, by first focusing interventions on 57 regions (EHE jurisdictions) that contributed to more than 50% of annual HIV diagnoses. Mathematical models that project HIV incidence evaluate the impact of interventions and inform intervention decisions. However, current models are either national level, which do not consider jurisdictional heterogeneity, or independent jurisdiction-specific, which do not consider cross jurisdictional interactions. Data suggests that a significant proportion of persons have sexual partnerships outside their own jurisdiction. However, the sensitivity of these jurisdictional interactions on model outcomes and intervention decisions hasn't been studied. METHOD(S): We developed an ordinary differential equations based compartmental model to generate national-level projections of HIV in the U.S., through dynamic simulations of 96 epidemiological sub-models representing 54 EHE and 42 non-EHE jurisdictions. A Bernoulli equation modeled HIV-transmissions using a mixing matrix to simulate sexual partnerships within and outside jurisdictions. To evaluate sensitivity of jurisdictional interactions on model outputs, we analyzed 16 scenarios, combinations of a) proportion of sexual partnerships mixing outside jurisdiction: no-mixing, low-level-mixing-within-state, high-level-mixing-within-state, or high-level-mixing-within-and-outside-state; b) jurisdictional heterogeneity in care and demographics: homogenous or heterogeneous; and c) intervention assumptions for 2019-2030: baseline or EHE-plan (diagnose, treat, and prevent). RESULT(S): Change in incidence in mixing compared to no-mixing scenarios varied by EHE and non-EHE jurisdictions and aggregation-level. When assuming jurisdictional heterogeneity and baseline-intervention, the change in aggregated incidence ranged from -2 to 0% for EHE and 5 to 21% for non-EHE, but within each jurisdiction it ranged from -31 to 46% for EHE and-18 to 109% for non-EHE. Thus, incidence estimates were sensitive to jurisdictional mixing more at the jurisdictional level. As a result, jurisdiction-specific HIV-testing intervals inferred from the model to achieve the EHE-plan were also sensitive, e.g., when no-mixing scenarios suggested testing every 1year (or 3years), the three mixing-levels suggested testing every 0.8 to 1.2years, 0.6 to 1.5years, and 0.6 to 1.5years, respectively (or 2.6 to 3.5years, 2 to 4.8years, and 2.2 to 4.1years, respectively). Similar patterns were observed when assuming jurisdictional homogeneity, however, change in incidence in mixing compared to no-mixing scenarios were high even in aggregated incidence. CONCLUSION(S): Accounting jurisdictional mixing and heterogeneity could improve model-based analyses.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably heightened concerns regarding the prediction of communicable disease spread. This study introduces an innovative agent-based modeling approach. In this model, the quantification of human-to-human transmission aligns with the dynamic variations in the viral load within an individual, termed "within-host" and adheres to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) process, referred to as "between-host." Variations in the viral load over time affect the infectivity between individual agents. This model diverges from the traditional SIR model, which employs a constant transmission probability, by incorporating a dynamic, time-dependent transmission probability influenced by the viral load in a host agent. The proposed model retains the time-integrated transmission probability characteristic of the conventional SIR model. As observed in this model, the overall epidemic size remains consistent with the predictions of the standard SIR model. Nonetheless, compared to predictions based on the classical SIR process, notable differences existed in the peak number of the infected individuals and the timing of this peak. These nontrivial differences are induced by the direct correlation between the time-evolving transmission probability and the viral load within a host agent. The developed model can inform targeted intervention strategies and public health policies by providing detailed insights into disease spread dynamics, crucial for effectively managing epidemics.Copyright © 2023 Tatsukawa et al.

Moreover, removing LTCF cases from the analysis sharpens the analysis of the population in general, showing a more gradual increase in cases at the start of the pandemic and a steeper increase when the second surge occurred., Conclusions: We anticipate that this procedure could be helpful to policymakers in other states or municipalities now and in the future.

   pages = {25-41},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has placed forecasting models at the forefront of health policy making. Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams.

   number = {3 March},
   pages = {e0266096},
   abstract = {Background A combined forecast from multiple models is typically more accurate than an individual forecast, but there are few examples of studies of combining in infectious disease forecasting. We investigated the accuracy of different ways of combining interval forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) mortality. Methods We considered weekly interval forecasts, for 1- to 4-week prediction horizons, with out-of-sample periods of approximately 18 months ending on 8 January 2022, for multiple locations in the United States, using data from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Our comparison involved simple and more complex combining methods, including methods that involve trimming outliers or performance-based weights. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using interval scores, weighted interval scores, skill scores, ranks, and reliability diagrams. Results The weighted inverse score and median combining methods performed best for forecasts of incident deaths. Overall, the leading inverse score method was 12% better than the mean benchmark method in forecasting the 95% interval and, considering all interval forecasts, the median was 7% better than the mean. Overall, the median was the most accurate method for forecasts of cumulative deaths. Compared to the mean, the median's accuracy was 65% better in forecasting the 95% interval, and 43% better considering all interval forecasts. For all combining methods except the median, combining forecasts from only compartmental models produced better forecasts than combining forecasts from all models. Conclusions Combining forecasts can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting to health policy decision making during epidemics. The relative performance of combining methods depends on the extent of outliers and the type of models in the combination. The median combination has the advantage of being robust to outlying forecasts. Our results support the Hub's use of the median and we recommend further investigation into the use of weighted methods.Copyright © 2022 Taylor, Taylor.

   abstract = {Emergency departments (EDs) had to considerably change their patient flow policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes affect patient crowding, waiting time, and other qualities related to patient care and experience. Field experiments, surveys, and simulation models can generally offer insights into patient flow under pandemic conditions. This paper provides a thorough and transparent account of the development of a multi-method simulation model that emulates actual patient flow in the emergency department under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Additionally, a number of performance measures useful to practitioners are introduced. A conceptual model was extracted from the main stakeholders at the case hospital through incremental elaboration and turned into a computational model. Two agent types were mainly modeled: patient and rooms. The simulated behavior of patient flow was validated with real-world data (Smart Crowding) and was able to replicate actual behavior in terms of patient occupancy. In order to further the validity, the study recommends several phenomena to be studied and included in future simulation models such as more agents (medical doctors, nurses, beds), delays due to interactions with other departments in the hospital and treatment time changes at higher occupancies.},

Contact tracing (CT) alone can control epidemic spreading CT efficacy changes under mobility lockdowns (LDs) A small fraction of indirect transmission can impede disease control What is the implication of the main finding? Detailed knowledge regarding transmission routes is crucial to determine efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies Reduction of indirect transmission via fomites becomes particular important in the course of mobility LDs The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised major health policy questions. Direct transmission via respiratory droplets seems to be the dominant route of its transmission. However, indirect transmission via shared contact of contaminated objects may also occur. The contribution of each transmission route to epidemic spread might change during lock-down scenarios. Here, we simulate viral spread of an abstract epidemic considering both routes of transmission by use of a stochastic, agent-based SEIR model. We show that efficient contact tracing (CT) at a high level of incidence can stabilize daily cases independently of the transmission route long before effects of herd immunity become relevant. CT efficacy depends on the fraction of cases that do not show symptoms. Combining CT with lock-down scenarios that reduce agent mobility lowers the incidence for exclusive direct transmission scenarios and can even eradicate the epidemic. However, even for small fractions of indirect transmission, such lockdowns can impede CT efficacy and increase case numbers. These counterproductive effects can be reduced by applying measures that favor distancing over reduced mobility. In summary, we show that the efficacy of lock-downs depends on the transmission route. Our results point to the particular importance of hygiene measures during mobility lock-downs.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background. Infectious diseases constitute a significant concern worldwide due to their increasing prevalence, associated health risks, and the socioeconomic costs. Machine learning (ML) models and epidemic models formulated using deterministic differential equations are the most dominant tools for analyzing and modeling the transmission of infectious diseases. However, ML models can be inconsistent in extracting the dynamics of a disease in the presence of data drifts. Likewise, the capability of epidemic models is constrained to parameter dimensions and estimation. We aimed at creating a framework of informed ML that integrates a random forest (RF) with an adapted susceptible infectious recovered (SIR) model to account for accuracy and consistency in stochasticity within the dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. An adapted SIR model was used to inform a default RF on predicting new COVID-19 cases (NCCs) at given intervals. We validated the performance of the informed RF (IRF) using real data. We used Botswana's pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) and non-PIs (NPIs) adopted between February 2020 and August 2022. The discrepancy between predictions and observations is modeled using loss functions, which are minimized, interpreted, and used to assess the IRF. Results. The findings on the real data have revealed the effectiveness of the default RF in modeling and predicting NCCs. The use of the effective reproductive rate to inform the RF yielded an excellent predictive power (84%) compared with 75% by the default RF. Conclusion. This research has potential to inform policy and decision makers in developing systems to evaluate interventions for infectious diseases., Highlights: This framework is initiated by incorporating model outputs from an epidemic model to a machine learning model.An informed random forest (RF) is instantiated to model government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This framework does not require data transformations, and the epidemic model is shown to boost the RF's performance. This is a baseline knowledge-informed learning framework for assessing public health interventions in Botswana. Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.},

Design Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Setting Multiple UK National Health Service (NHS) ophthalmology centres. Participants Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals were obtained from four NHS Trusts comparing April 2020 with April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on 1-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20 825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision <=6/60, <=6/24 and >=6/12 at 1 year under four hypothetical scenarios: 0-month, 3-month, 6-month and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision <=6/60 at 1 year nationally. Results The number of nAMD referrals dropped on average by 72% (range 65%-87%). Simulated 1-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision <=6/60 from 15.5% (13.2%-17.9%) to 23.3% (20.7%-25.9%), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision >=6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1%-38.1%) to 26.4% (23.8%-29.2%). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level for 1 month nationally, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision <=6/60 at 1 year. Conclusions We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision <=6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at 1 year.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

   abstract = {Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR or susceptible-infectious-recovered) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.Copyright © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

   title = {Deep learning and likelihood approaches for viral phylogeography converge on the same answers whether the inference model is right or wrong},
   journal = {Systematic biology},
   abstract = {Analysis of phylogenetic trees has become an essential tool in epidemiology. Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. How- ever, these methods are often computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free infer- ence from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among five locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression which we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) and greatly overlap with HPDs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Fi- nally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the loca- tion of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on aver- age over 3 orders of magnitude faster after training. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

   title = {Feasibility of hepatitis C elimination in an ongoing pandemic era: A model-based analysis in Ontario},
   journal = {Canadian Liver Journal},
   volume = {6},
   number = {1},
   pages = {135-137},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Managing chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is challenging because the majority of those infected are asymptomatic. Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral therapy, whether Canada will be able to meet the World Health Organization (WHO)'s elimination goals on schedule with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 is questionable. PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) incorporating the current hepatitis C virus (HCV) risk-based screening and treatment strategy together with the impact of COVID-19 to predict HCV incidence and prevalence in Ontario over the next decade. METHOD(S): By combining multi-agent systems and complex networks, we developed an ABM to explain the Ontario HCV epidemic and simulate transmission risk networks that include people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men. We simulated the entire Ontario population, stratifying individuals by age, gender, sexual and injection behaviours, and immigration status. The model considered the negative impacts of COVID- 19 on screening and treatment after 2019 and the potential effects of future immigration from regions where HCV is of high endemicity. We estimated parameters from literature-derived estimates regarding Ontario demographics, epidemiology, injection and sexual behaviours. HCV-related outcomes data derived from Ontario health administrative data were used for calibration, including the reported incidence of CHC, decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The calibrated ABM was then used to predict the incidence and prevalence of CHC, DC, HCC, and liver-related deaths in Ontario from 2015 to 2030 for the current screening and treatment strategy. RESULT(S): Our calibrated model demonstrated a good match between the simulation results with the historical reported CHC, DC and HCC cases. The ABM predicted that the total incidence and prevalence of CHC in Ontario would only fall by 2.4% and 18.7% in 2030, respectively. The total incidence of HCV-attributable DC, HCC, and liverrelated deaths would decrease by 32.8%, 30.2%, and 19.7%, respectively, in 2030 compared to 2015, the time when the WHO established the elimination goals. In comparison with the original projection without the negative effect from COVID-19, the viral hepatitis C elimination effort was slowed down by 15.3%, 15.3%, and 16% in 2030 in terms of preventing new cases of DC, HCC, and liver-related deaths, respectively (Figure). CONCLUSION(S): We have developed an ABM that reflects the dynamics of HCV transmission and the impact of COVID-19, which enables forecasting the epidemiology of HCV for policy-level decision making in Canada. Our projected results suggest that the current HCV screening and treatment strategy are insufficient in achieving the WHO elimination goals during this ongoing pandemic era. (Figure Presented).},

   title = {Feasibility of hepatitis C elimination by screening and treatment alone in high-income countries},
   journal = {Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND AIMS: Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral therapy, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to cause a major public health burden. In many high-income countries, treatment rates have been declining, which was exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, threatening the ability to meet the World Health Organization (WHO)'s targets for eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a public health threat by 2030. We sought to model the impact of CHC in Canada, a resource-rich country with ongoing immigration from HCV-endemic regions; which relies exclusively on risk-based screening for case identification. APPROACH RESULTS: We developed an agent-based model to characterize the HCV epidemic in a high-income country with ongoing immigration. Combinations of prevention such as harm-reduction, screening, and treatment strategies were considered. Model parameters were estimated from the literature and calibrated against historical HCV data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. Under the current status quo of risk-based screening, we predict the incidence of CHC-induced decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths would decrease by 79.4%, 76.1%, and 62.1%, respectively, between 2015-2030, but CHC incidence would only decrease by 11.1%. Results were sensitive to HCV transmission rate and annual number of people initiating treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Current risk-based screening, and subsequent treatment, will be inadequate to achieve WHO goals. With extensive scale-up in screening, and treatment, the mortality target may be achievable, but the target for preventing new CHC cases is unlikely reachable, highlighting the importance of developing enhanced harm-reduction strategies for HCV elimination.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the influence of ergonomics on individual work performance of nurse educators working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and to develop a model of the moderating effect of home environment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, predictive-correlational design. METHOD(S): Utilizing interaction moderation and structural equation modeling, 214 consecutively-selected educators from nursing schools in the Greater Manila Area, Philippines completed a four-part online survey. RESULT(S): Physical, cognitive, and organizational ergonomics positively influenced individual work performance. Home environment had a linear, positive moderation on the effects of physical and cognitive ergonomics on individual work performance but had a negative moderating effect with organizational ergonomics. CONCLUSION(S): The moderated model underscored the positive effects of ergonomics and the moderating effect of home environment on the individual work performance of nurse educators working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this knowledge can be used in developing appropriate programs, strategies, and policies. IMPACT: The moderated model highlights the need for policies and programs, training and education, and organizational evaluation geared towards promoting healthy workplace and work-life balance among nurse educators transitioning to remote work and online teaching.

   abstract = {COVID-19 is now one of the most leading causes of death in the United States (US). Systemic health, social and economic disparities have put the minorities and economically poor communities at a higher risk than others. There is an immediate requirement to develop a reliable measure of county-level vulnerabilities that can capture the heterogeneity of vulnerable communities. This study reports a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identifying and mapping vulnerable counties. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning-based vulnerability model using CDC's sociodemographic and COVID-19-specific themes. An innovative 'COVID-19 Impact Assessment' algorithm was also developed for evaluating severity of the pandemic and to train the vulnerability model. Developed C19VI was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI and the census data, we explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes. Our index indicates that 575 counties (45 million people) fall into the 'very high' vulnerability class, 765 counties (66 million people) in the 'high' vulnerability class, and 1435 counties (204 million people) in the 'moderate' or 'low' vulnerability class. Only 367 counties (20 million people) were found as 'very low' vulnerable areas. Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 524 counties with a racial minority population higher than 13% and 420 counties with poverty higher than 20% are in the 'very high' or 'high' vulnerability classes. The C19VI aims at helping public health officials and disaster management agencies to develop effective mitigation strategies especially for the disproportionately impacted communities.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to prepare the government and citizens of India to take or implement the control measures proactively to reduce the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. RESULT(S): The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further. This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.},

The SIIR model has the advantage of being able to explicitly handle asymptomatic individuals who are delayed in discovery or are extremely difficult to be discovered in the real world.

   journal = {Annals of operations research},
   pages = {1-25},
   abstract = {During a pandemic, medical specialists have substantial challenges in discovering and validating new disease risk factors and designing effective treatment strategies. Traditionally, this approach entails several clinical studies and trials that might last several years, during which strict preventive measures are enforced to manage the outbreak and limit the death toll. Advanced data analytics technologies, on the other hand, could be utilized to monitor and expedite the procedure. This research integrates evolutionary search algorithms, Bayesian belief networks, and innovative interpretation techniques to provide a comprehensive exploratory-descriptive-explanatory machine learning methodology to assist clinical decision-makers in responding promptly to pandemic scenarios. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study in which the survival of COVID-19 patients is determined using inpatient and emergency department (ED) encounters from a real-world electronic health record database. Following an exploratory phase in which genetic algorithms are used to identify a set of the most critical chronic risk factors and their validation using descriptive tools based on the concept of Bayesian Belief Nets, the framework develops and trains a probabilistic graphical model to explain and predict patient survival (with an AUC of 0.92). Finally, a publicly available online, probabilistic decision support inference simulator was constructed to facilitate what-if analysis and aid general users and healthcare professionals in interpreting model findings. The results widely corroborate intensive and expensive clinical trial research assessments.

   pages = {56},
   abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are the two major public health emergencies in the Philippines. The country is ranked fourth worldwide in TB incidence cases despite national efforts and initiatives to mitigate the disease. Concurrently, the Philippines has the fastest-growing HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific region. The TB-HIV dual epidemic forms a lethal combination enhancing each other's progress, driving the deterioration of immune responses. In order to understand and describe the transmission dynamics and epidemiological patterns of the co-infection, a compartmental model for TB-HIV is developed. A class of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who did not know their HIV status is incorporated into the model. These unaware PLHIV who do not seek medical treatment are potential sources of new HIV infections that could significantly influence the disease transmission dynamics. Sensitivity analysis using the partial rank correlation coefficient is performed to assess model parameters that are influential to the output of interests. The model is calibrated using available Philippine data on TB, HIV, and TB-HIV. Parameters that are identified include TB and HIV transmission rates, progression rates from exposed to active TB, and from TB-latent with HIV to active infectious TB with HIV in the AIDS stage. Uncertainty analysis is performed to identify the degree of accuracy of the estimates. Simulations predict an alarming increase of 180% and 194% in new HIV and TB-HIV infections in 2025, respectively, relative to 2019 data. These projections underscore an ongoing health crisis in the Philippines that calls for a combined and collective effort by the government and the public to take action against the lethal combination of TB and HIV.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted our everyday life, forcing the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions in many countries and putting public health services and healthcare systems worldwide under stress. These circumstances are leading to unintended effects such as the increase in the burden of other diseases., Methods: Here, using a data-driven epidemiological model for tuberculosis (TB) spreading, we describe the expected rise in TB incidence and mortality if COVID-associated changes in TB notification are sustained and attributable entirely to disrupted diagnosis and treatment adherence., Results: Our calculations show that the reduction in diagnosis of new TB cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in 228k (CI 187-276) excess deaths in India, 111k (CI 93-134) in Indonesia, 27k (CI 21-33) in Pakistan, and 12k (CI 9-18) in Kenya., Conclusions: We show that it is possible to reverse these excess deaths by increasing the pre-covid diagnosis capabilities from 15 to 50% for 2 to 4 years. This would prevent almost all TB-related excess mortality that could be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic if no additional preventative measures are introduced. Our work therefore provides guidelines for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis epidemic in the years to come. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.},

   abstract = {Timely forecasts of the emergence, re-emergence and elimination of human infectious diseases allow for proactive, rather than reactive, decisions that save lives. Recent theory suggests that a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping point - early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD) - can anticipate disease emergence and elimination. Empirical studies documenting CSD in observed disease dynamics are scarce, but such demonstration of concept is essential to the further development of model-independent outbreak detection systems. Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence and elimination, suggesting that CSD should be detectable before disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These findings support the idea that statistical signals based on CSD, coupled with decision-support algorithms and expert judgement, could provide the basis for early warning systems of disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Background COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. Methods and findings To explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%-92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2-65), 54 (95% PI, 3-223), and 370 (95% PI, 4-1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300-463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300-567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800-595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660-2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030-3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden. Conclusions Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.Copyright: © 2020 Truelove et al.

   abstract = {A critical operations management problem in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is cognizance of (a) the number of all carriers at large (CaL) conveying the SARS-CoV-2, including asymptomatic ones and (b) the infection rate (IR). Both are random and unobservable, affecting the spread of the disease, patient arrivals to health care units (HCUs) and the number of deaths. A novel, inventory perspective of COVID-19 is proposed, with random inflow, random losses and retrials (recurrent cases) and delayed/distributed exit, with randomly varying fractions of the exit distribution. A minimal construal, it enables representation of COVID-19 evolution with close fit of national incidence profiles, including single and multiple pattern outbreaks, oscillatory, periodic or non-periodic evolution, followed by retraction, leveling off, or strong resurgence. Furthermore, based on asymptotic laws, the minimum number of variables that must be monitored for identifying CaL and IR is determined and a real-time identification method is presented. The method is data-driven, utilizing the entry rate to HCUs and scaled, or dimensionless variables, including the mean residence time of symptomatic carriers in CaL and the mean residence time in CaL of patients entering HCUs. As manifested by several robust case studies of national COVID-19 incidence profiles, it provides efficient identification in real-time under unbiased monitoring error, without relying on any model. The propagation factor, a stochastic process, is reconstructed from the identified trajectories of CaL and IR, enabling evaluation of control measures. The results are useful towards the design of policies restricting COVID-19 and encumbrance to HCUs and mitigating economic contraction. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We suggest a novel mathematical framework for the in-homogeneous spatial spreading of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, "reaction-diffusion", spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection "heat-maps" show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters. Application of our model in different countries can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas-such as those underway in a few countries.Copyright © 2021 Tsori, Granek.

A stochastic transmission model was used to assess the potential effectiveness of control strategies at controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Three strategies included lack of prevention of subclinical transmission (Strategy A), partial prevention using testing with different accuracy (Strategy B) and complete prevention by isolating all at-risk people (Strategy C, Taiwan policy). The high probability of containing COVID-19 in Strategy C is observed in different scenario, had varied in the number of initial cases (5, 20, and 40), the reproduction number (1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3.5), the proportion of at-risk people being investigated (40%, 60%, 80%, to 90%), the delay from symptom onset to isolation (long and short), and the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset (<1%, 15%, and 30%). Strategy C achieved probability of 80% under advantageous scenario, such as low number of initial cases and high coverage of epidemiological investigation but Strategy B and C rarely achieved that of 60%. Considering the unsatisfactory accuracy of current testing and insufficient resources, isolation of all at-risk people, as adopted in Taiwan, could be an effective alternative.

   abstract = {There is increasing recognition of the role that artificial intelligence (AI) systems can play in managing health crises. One such approach, which allows for analysing the potential consequences of different policy interventions is agent-based social simulations (ABSS). Here, the actions and interactions of autonomous agents are modelled to generate virtual societies that can serve as a "testbed" for investigating and comparing different interventions and scenarios. This piece focuses on two key challenges of ABSS in collaborative policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. These were defining valuable scenarios to simulate and the availability of appropriate data. This paper posits that drawing on the research on the "everyday" digital health perspective in designing ABSS before or during health crises, can overcome aspects of these challenges. The focus on digital health interventions reflects a rapid shift in the adoption of such technologies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the new challenges this poses for policy makers. It is argued that by accounting for the everyday digital health in modelling, ABSS would be a more powerful tool in future health crisis management.Copyright © 2024 Tucker and Lorig.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current syphilis epidemic in the United States is concentrated in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), but substantial heterosexual transmission is reported in some parts of the country. Using the US states of Louisiana and Massachusetts as case studies, we investigated how epidemic context influences the impact of population screening approaches for syphilis control., METHODS: We constructed a compartmental metapopulation model parameterized to describe observed patterns of syphilis transmission. We estimated the impact of different approaches to screening, including perfect adherence to current US screening guidelines in MSM., RESULTS: In Louisiana, where syphilis cases are more evenly distributed among MSM and heterosexual populations, we projected that screening according to guidelines would contribute to no change or an increase in syphilis burden, compared with burden with current estimated screening coverage. In Massachusetts, which has a more MSM-focused outbreak, we projected that screening according to guidelines would be as or more effective than current screening coverage in most population groups., CONCLUSIONS: Men who have sex with men-focused approaches to screening may be insufficient for control when there is substantial transmission in heterosexual populations. Epidemic characteristics may be useful when identifying at-risk groups for syphilis screening.},

Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policies to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens.

   volume = {11},
   abstract = {The role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is controversial, with some claiming they are an important driver of the pandemic and others arguing that transmission in schools is negligible. School cluster reports that have been collected in various jurisdictions are a source of data about transmission in schools. These reports consist of the name of a school, a date, and the number of students known to be infected. We provide a simple model for the frequency and size of clusters in this data, based on random arrivals of index cases at schools who then infect their classmates with a highly variable rate, fitting the overdispersion evident in the data. We fit our model to reports from four Canadian provinces, providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size, as well as the distribution of the instantaneous transmission parameter beta, whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment. According to our model with parameters estimated from the data, in all four provinces (i) more than 65% of non-index cases occur in the 20% largest clusters, and (ii) reducing instantaneous transmission rate and the number of contacts a student has at any given time are effective in reducing the total number of cases, whereas strict bubbling (keeping contacts consistent over time) does not contribute much to reduce cluster sizes. We predict strict bubbling to be more valuable in scenarios with substantially higher transmission rates. Copyright © 2022, Tupper et al.},

   pages = {e1009230},
   abstract = {Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Across each state, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was marked by policies and rhetoric that often corresponded to the political party in power. These diverging responses have sparked broad ongoing discussion about how the political leadership of a state may affect not only the COVID-19 case numbers in a given state but also the subjective individual experience of the pandemic., OBJECTIVE: This study leverages state-level data from Google Search Trends and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) daily case data to investigate the temporal relationship between increases in relative search volume for COVID-19 symptoms and corresponding increases in case data. I aimed to identify whether there are state-level differences in patterns of lag time across each of the 4 spikes in the data (RQ1) and whether the political climate in a given state is associated with these differences (RQ2)., METHODS: Using publicly available data from Google Trends and the CDC, linear mixed modeling was utilized to account for random state-level intercepts. Lag time was operationalized as number of days between a peak (a sustained increase before a sustained decline) in symptom search data and a corresponding spike in case data and was calculated manually for each of the 4 spikes in individual states. Google offers a data set that tracks the relative search incidence of more than 400 potential COVID-19 symptoms, which is normalized on a 0-100 scale. I used the CDC's definition of the 11 most common COVID-19 symptoms and created a single construct variable that operationalizes symptom searches. To measure political climate, I considered the proportion of 2020 Trump popular votes in a state as well as a dummy variable for the political party that controls the governorship and a continuous variable measuring proportional party control of federal Congressional representatives., RESULTS: The strongest overall fit was for a linear mixed model that included proportion of 2020 Trump votes as the predictive variable of interest and included controls for mean daily cases and deaths as well as population. Additional political climate variables were discarded for lack of model fit. Findings indicated evidence that there are statistically significant differences in lag time by state but that no individual variable measuring political climate was a statistically significant predictor of these differences., CONCLUSIONS: Given that there will likely be future pandemics within this political climate, it is important to understand how political leadership affects perceptions of and corresponding responses to public health crises. Although this study did not fully model this relationship, I believe that future research can build on the state-level differences that I identified by approaching the analysis with a different theoretical model, method for calculating lag time, or level of geographic modeling.

   abstract = {Insights about the dominant dynamics, coupled structures and the unknown uncertainties of the pandemic diseases play an important role in determining the future characteristics of the pandemic diseases. To enhance the prediction capabilities of the models, properties of the unknown uncertainties in the pandemic disease, which can be utterly random, or function of the system dynamics, or it can be correlated with an unknown function, should be determined. The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties. For instance, the uncertainties correlated with an unknown function imply existence of an undetected factor in the casualties. In this paper, we extend the SpID-N (Suspicious-Infected-Death with non-pharmacological policies) model as in the form of MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) structure by adding the multi-dimensional unknown uncertainties. The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries. Obtained model with the corresponding uncertainties predicts a distinctive second peak where the number of deaths, infected and suspicious casualties disappear in 240, 290, and more than 300 days, respectively, for Turkey.

   journal = {ISA transactions},
   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has endured constituting formidable economic, social, educational, and phycological challenges for the societies. Moreover, during pandemic outbreaks, the hospitals are overwhelmed with patients requiring more intensive care units and intubation equipment. Therein, to cope with these urgent healthcare demands, the state authorities seek ways to develop policies based on the estimated future casualties. These policies are mainly non-pharmacological policies including the restrictions, curfews, closures, and lockdowns. In this paper, we construct three model structures of the SpInItIbD-N (suspicious Sp, infected In, intensive care It, intubated Ib, and dead D together with the non-pharmacological policies N) holding two key targets. The first one is to predict the future COVID-19 casualties including the intensive care and intubated ones, which directly determine the need for urgent healthcare facilities, and the second one is to analyse the linear and non-linear dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic under the non-pharmacological policies. In this respect, we have modified the non-pharmacological policies and incorporated them within the models whose parameters are learned from the available data. The trained models with the data released by the Turkish Health Ministry confirmed that the linear SpInItIbD-N model yields more accurate results under the imposed non-pharmacological policies. It is important to note that the non-pharmacological policies have a damping effect on the pandemic casualties and this can dominate the non-linear dynamics. Herein, a model without pharmacological or non-pharmacological policies might have more dominant non-linear dynamics. In addition, the paper considers two machine learning approaches to optimize the unknown parameters of the constructed models. The results show that the recursive neural network has superior performance for learning nonlinear dynamics. However, the batch least squares outperforms in the presence of linear dynamics and stochastic data. The estimated future pandemic casualties with the linear SpInItIbD-N model confirm that the suspicious, infected, and dead casualties converge to zero from 200000, 1400, 200 casualties, respectively. The convergences occur in 120 days under the current conditions.Copyright © 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities. Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the effective reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {The unexpected early cessation of the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak demonstrated shortcomings of popular forecasting approaches and has not been fully understood yet. A popular hypothesis is that public health interventions mitigated the spread, such as ETUs and safe burials. We investigate whether risk heterogeneity within the population could serve as an alternative explanation. We introduce a model for spread in heterogeneous host population that is particularly well suited for early predictions due to its simplicity and ease of application. Furthermore, we explore the conditions under which the observed epidemic trajectory can be explained without taking into account the effect of public health interventions. While the obtained fits closely match the total case count time series, closer inspection of sub-population results made us conclude that risk heterogeneity is unlikely to fully explain the early cessation of Ebola; other factors such as behavioral changes and other interventions likely played a major role. More accurate predictions in a future scenario require models that allow for early sub-exponential growth, as well as access to additional data on patient occupation (risk level) and location, to allow identify local phenomena that influence spreading behavior.Copyright © 2019 Uekermann et al.

   abstract = {COVID-19 has a disease and health phenomenon and has sociological and economic adverse effects. Accurate prediction of the spread of the epidemic will help in the planning of health management and the development of economic and sociological action plans. In the literature, there are many studies to analyse and predict the spread of COVID-19 in cities and countries. However, there is no study to predict and analyse the cross-country spread in the world's most populous countries. In this study, it was aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The motivation of this study is to reduce the workload of health workers, take preventive measures and optimize health processes by predicting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. A hybrid deep learning model was developed to predict and analyse COVID-19 cross-country spread and a case study was carried out for the world's most populous countries. The developed model was tested extensively using RMSE, MAE and R2. The experimental results showed that the developed model was more successful in predicting and analysis of COVID-19 cross-country spread in the world's most populous countries than LR, RF, SVM, MLP, CNN, GRU, LSTM and base CNN-GRU. In the developed model, CNN performs convolution and pooling operations to extract spatial features from the input data. GRU provides learning of long-term and non-linear relationships inferred by CNN. The developed hybrid model was more successful than the other models compared, as it enabled the effective features of the CNN and GRU models to be used together. The prediction and analysis of the cross-country spread of COVID-19 in the world's most populated countries can be presented as a novelty of this study. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: Ending the COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the most prominent challenges in recent human history. Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars toward achieving that goal. Objective(s): We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Method(s): The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay), and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at https://theguarani.com.br/ or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 3,722,128 cases reported worldwide as of May 8th 2020. Result(s): We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within 1 week, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusion(s): These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.© Copyright © 2020 Utsunomiya, Utsunomiya, Torrecilha, Paulan, Milanesi and Garcia.},

   title = {Production-sharing of critical resources with dynamic demand under pandemic situation: The COVID-19 pandemic},
   journal = {Omega},
   volume = {120},
   pages = {102909},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 virus's high transmissibility has resulted in the virus's rapid spread throughout the world, which has brought several repercussions, ranging from a lack of sanitary and medical products to the collapse of medical systems. Hence, governments attempt to re-plan the production of medical products and reallocate limited health resources to combat the pandemic. This paper addresses a multi-period production-inventory-sharing problem (PISP) to overcome such a circumstance, considering two consumable and reusable products. We introduce a new formulation to decide on production, inventory, delivery, and sharing quantities. The sharing will depend on net supply balance, allowable demand overload, unmet demand, and the reuse cycle of reusable products. Undeniably, the dynamic demand for products during pandemic situations must be reflected effectively in addressing the multi-period PISP. A bespoke compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible (SEIHRS) epidemiological model with a control policy is proposed, which also accounts for the influence of people's behavioral response as a result of the knowledge of adequate precautions. An accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm with tailored valid inequalities is offered to solve the model. Finally, we consider a realistic case study - the COVID-19 pandemic in France - to examine the computational proficiency of the decomposition method. The computational results reveal that the proposed decomposition method coupled with effective valid inequalities can solve large-sized test problems in a reasonable computational time and 9.88 times faster than the commercial Gurobi solver. Moreover, the sharing mechanism reduces the total cost of the system and the unmet demand on the average up to 32.98% and 20.96%, respectively. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).},

The traditional 1-on-1 consultation model was untenable. Therefore, we rapidly restructured our ID division to provide effective consultative services. We implemented a novel unit-based group rounds model that focused on delivering key updates to teams and providing unit-wide consultations simultaneously to all team members. Effectiveness of the program was studied using Likert-scale survey data. The survey captured data from the first month of the Detroit COVID-19 pandemic. During this period there were approximately 950 patients hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19. The survey of trainees and faculty reported an overall 95% positive response to delivery of information, new knowledge acquisition, and provider confidence in the care of COVID-19 patients. This showed that the unit-based consult model is a sustainable effort to provide care during epidemics.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

   abstract = {COVID-19 highlighted modeling as a cornerstone of pandemic response. But it also revealed that current models may not fully exploit the high-resolution data on disease progression, epidemic surveillance and host behavior, now available. Take the epidemic threshold, which quantifies the spreading risk throughout epidemic emergence, mitigation, and control. Its use requires oversimplifying either disease or host contact dynamics. We introduce the epidemic graph diagrams to overcome this by computing the epidemic threshold directly from arbitrarily complex data on contacts, disease and interventions. A grammar of diagram operations allows to decompose, compare, simplify models with computational efficiency, extracting theoretical understanding. We use the diagrams to explain the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the 2007-2008 season, and demonstrate that neglecting non-infectious prodromic stages of sexually transmitted infections biases the predicted epidemic risk, compromising control. The diagrams are general, and improve our capacity to respond to present and future public health challenges.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {COVID-19 prediction models are characterized by uncertainties due to fluctuating parameters, such as changes in infection or recovery rates. While deterministic models often predict epidemic peaks too early, incorporating these fluctuations into the SIR model can provide a more accurate representation of peak timing. Predicting R0, the basic reproduction number, remains a major challenge with significant implications for government policy and strategy. In this study, we propose a tool for policy makers to show the effects of possible fluctuations in policy strategies on different R0 levels. Results show that epidemic peaks in the United States occur at varying dates, up to 50, 87, and 82 days from the beginning of the second, third, and fourth waves. Our findings suggest that inaccurate predictions and public health policies may result from underestimating fluctuations in infection or recovery rates. Therefore, incorporating fluctuations into SIR models should be considered when predicting epidemic peak times to inform appropriate public health responses.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {To reach its goal of ending AIDS by 2030, Thailand has adopted antiretroviral treatment as prevention and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) as its core HIV control strategy. However, in the absence of reliable epidemiologic indicators, the impact of these policies on the course of the HIV epidemic in these groups remains unknown. To help answer this question, we formulated an HIV epidemic consensus initiative for Bangkok, Thailand, to analyze epidemiologic and program data and reach agreement between experts and stakeholders on the evolving state of the HIV epidemic among MSM and TGW. A customized Delphi process was used to consult and consolidate viewpoints of experts and stakeholders. Experts presented and discussed HIV prevalence and incidence data from recent and ongoing studies among MSM and TGW in Bangkok (2014 to 2018) during a meeting with stakeholders representing government, donors, and civil society. Agreement about the course of the HIV epidemic among MSM and TGW was attained by voting consensus. Based on presented data, meeting participants agreed that HIV prevalence and incidence had decreased among Bangkok MSM from 2014 to 2018. Despite these declines, HIV prevalence and incidence were found to remain high. This was particularly the case among younger MSM. Participants agreed that there was no evidence for a decrease in HIV prevalence and incidence among Bangkok TGW. Introduction of antiretroviral treatment as prevention and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis may have contributed to these declines. However, HIV prevalence and incidence remained high, and no signs of a decrease were reported among Bangkok TGW. At the current rate of new HIV infections in MSM and TGW, Thailand will not reach its goal of ending AIDS by 2030. This HIV consensus initiative may serve as a model for building agreement and advocacy on epidemiologic and program data and their implications for a large metropolitan city.Copyright © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

   abstract = {The mathematical interpretation of interventions for the mitigation of epidemics in the literature often involves finding the optimal time to initiate an intervention and/or the use of the number of infections to manage impact. Whilst these methods may work in theory, in order to implement effectively they may require information which is not likely to be available in the midst of an epidemic, or they may require impeccable data about infection levels in the community. In reality, testing and cases data can only be as good as the policy of implementation and the compliance of the individuals, which implies that accurately estimating the levels of infections becomes difficult or complicated from the data that is provided. In this paper, we demonstrate a different approach to the mathematical modelling of interventions, not based on optimality or cases, but based on demand and capacity of hospitals who have to deal with the epidemic on a day to day basis. In particular, we use data-driven modelling to calibrate a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-died type model to infer parameters that depict the dynamics of the epidemic in several regions of the UK. We use the calibrated parameters for forecasting scenarios and understand, given a maximum capacity of hospital healthcare services, how the timing of interventions, severity of interventions, and conditions for the releasing of interventions affect the overall epidemic-picture. We provide an optimisation method to capture when, in terms of healthcare demand, an intervention should be put into place given a maximum capacity on the service. By using an equivalent agent-based approach, we demonstrate uncertainty quantification on the likelihood that capacity is not breached, by how much if it does, and the limit on demand that almost guarantees capacity is not breached.Copyright © 2023 Van Yperen et al.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health (WDGPH) has conducted an absenteeism-based influenza surveillance program in the WDG region of Ontario, Canada since 2008, using a 10% absenteeism threshold to raise an alert for the implementation of mitigating measures. A recent study indicated that model-based alternatives, such as distributed lag seasonal logistic regression models, provided improved alerts for detecting an upcoming epidemic. However model evaluation and selection was primarily based on alert accuracy, measured by the false alert rate (FAR), and failed to optimize timeliness. Here, a new metric that simultaneously evaluates epidemic alert accuracy and timeliness is proposed. The alert time quality (ATQ) metric is investigated as a model selection criterion on both a simulated and real data set. METHOD(S): The ATQ assessed alerts on a gradient, where alerts raised incrementally before or after an optimal day were considered informative, but were penalized for lack of timeliness. Summary statistics of ATQ, average alert time quality (AATQ) and first alert time quality (FATQ), were used for model evaluation and selection. Alerts raised by ATQ and FAR selected models were compared. Daily elementary school absenteeism and laboratory-confirmed influenza case data collected by WDGPH were used for demonstration and evaluation of the proposed metric. A simulation study that mimicked the WDG population and influenza demographics was conducted for further evaluation of the proposed metric. RESULT(S): The FATQ-selected model raised acceptable first alerts most frequently, while the AATQ-selected model raised first alerts within the ideal range most frequently. CONCLUSION(S): Models selected by either FATQ or AATQ would more effectively predict community influenza activity with the local community than those selected by FAR.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {The trajectory of COVID-19 epidemic waves in the general population of Belgium was analysed by defining quantitative criteria for epidemic waves from March 2020 to early 2023. Peaks and starting/ending times characterised nine waves numerated I to IX based on the daily reported incidence number (symbol INCID) and three "endemic" interval periods between the first four waves. The SIR compartmental model was applied to the first epidemic wave by fitting the daily prevalence pool (symbol I) calculated as the sum of the daily incidence rate and estimated number of subjects still infectious from the previous days. The basic reproductive number R0 was calculated based on the exponential growth rate during the early phase and on medical literature knowledge of the time of generation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first COVID-19 wave was well fitted by an open SIR model. According to this approach, dampened recurrent epidemic waves evolving through an endemic state would have been expected. This was not the case with the subsequent epidemic waves being characterised by new variants of concern (VOC). Evidence-based observations: 1) each epidemic wave affected less than a fifth of the general population; 2) the Vth epidemic wave (VOC Omicron) presented the greatest amplitude. The lack of recurrence of the same VOC during successive epidemic waves strongly suggests that a VOC has a limited persistence, disappearing from the population well before the expected proportion of the theoretical susceptible cohort being maximally infected. Fitting the theoretical SIR model, a limited persistence of VOCs in a population could explain that new VOCs replace old ones, even if the new VOC has a lower transmission rate than the preceding one. In conclusion, acquisition of potential defective mutations in VOC during an epidemic wave is a potential factor explaining the absence of resurgence of a same VOC during successive waves. Such an hypothesis is open to discussion and to rebuttal. A modified SIR model with epidemic waves of variable amplitude related not only to R0 and public health measures but also to acquisition of defective fitting in virus within a population should be tested.Copyright © 2024.

   abstract = {The present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has engendered a worldwide crisis on an enormous scale within a very short period. The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R0) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable. Isolation and tracing the contact of infected individuals are recommended to control the spread of disease.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world since December 2019. The main goal of this study is to develop a more effective method for diagnosing and predicting the COVID-19 spread and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures to reduce and stop the virus spread. To this end, the COVID-19 Decision-Making System (CDMS) was developed to study disease transmission. CDMS divides the population into groups as susceptible, infected, cured and dead. The trends of the people's number in these groups have deterministic and stochastic components. The deterministic components are described by a differential equations system with parameters determined by the data reported. The stochastic components are represented as an indicator of instability that characterizes the tendency of COVID-19 spread. The simulation experiments have shown a good agreement between the CDMS estimates and the data reported in Russia and Greece. The analysis performed showed that the newly-introduced instability indicator may be the precursor to the pandemic dynamics. In this context, our results showed three potential candidates for a second wave of COVID-19 disease: USA, Russia and Brazil. Although the proportion of infected individuals in countries with high temperatures is lower than in European countries and Russia, temperature and humidity are slowly affecting the effects of the pandemic. Finally, the results presented may contribute to the urgent need to reduce the risks associated with the second wave of the COVID-19, to improve public health intervention and safety measures to be taken by various countries.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop an information-modeling method for assessing and predicting the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, a detailed analysis of official statistical information provided by global and national organizations is carried out. The developed method is based on the algorithm of multi-channel big data processing considering the demographic and socio-economic information. COVID-19 data are analyzed using an instability indicator and a system of differential equations that describe the dynamics of four groups of people: susceptible, infected, recovered and dead. Indicators of the global sustainable development in various sectors are considered to analyze COVID-19 data. Stochastic processes induced by COVID-19 are assessed with the instability indicator showing the level of stability of official data and the reduction of the level of uncertainty. It turns out that the number of deaths is rising with the Human Development Index. It is revealed that COVID-19 divides the global population into three groups according to the relationship between Gross Domestic Product and the number of infected people. The prognosis for the number of infected people in December 2020 and January-February 2021 shows negative events which will decrease slowly.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {A generalized pathway model, with time-dependent parameters, is applied to describe the mortality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries that exhibit multiple waves of infections. The pathway approach adopted here is formulated explicitly in time, in the sense that the model's growth rate for the number of deaths or infections is written as an explicit function of time, rather than in terms of the cumulative quantity itself. This allows for a direct fit of the model to daily data (new deaths or new cases) without the need of any integration. The model is applied to COVID-19 mortality curves for ten selected countries and found to be in very good agreement with the data for all cases considered. From the fitted theoretical curves for a given location, relevant epidemiological information can be extracted, such as the starting and peak dates for each successive wave. It is argued that obtaining reliable estimates for such characteristic points is important for studying the effectiveness of interventions and the possible negative impact of their relaxation, as it allows for a direct comparison of the time of adoption/relaxation of control measures with the peaks and troughs of the epidemic curve.

   abstract = {In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures, including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of immense interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than 2.3. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.},

   abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained increasing attention as a complementary tool to conventional surveillance methods with potential for significant resource and labour savings when used for public health monitoring. Using WBE datasets to train machine learning algorithms and develop predictive models may also facilitate early warnings for the spread of outbreaks. The challenges associated with using machine learning for the analysis of WBE datasets and timeseries forecasting of COVID-19 were explored by running Random Forest (RF) algorithms on WBE datasets across 108 sites in five regions: Scotland, Catalonia, Ohio, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. This method uses measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment concentration in samples taken at the inlets of wastewater treatment plants, providing insight into the prevalence of infection in upstream wastewater catchment populations. RF's forecasting performance at each site was quantitatively evaluated by determining mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values, which was used to highlight challenges affecting future implementations of RF for WBE forecasting efforts. Performance was generally poor using WBE datasets from Catalonia, Scotland, and Ohio with 'reasonable' or better forecasts constituting 0 %, 5 %, and 0 % of these regions' forecasts, respectively. RF's performance was much stronger with WBE data from the Netherlands and Switzerland, which provided 55 % and 45 % 'reasonable' or better forecasts respectively. Sampling frequency and training set size were identified as key factors contributing to accuracy, while inclusion of too many unnecessary variables (or e.g., flow data) was identified as a contributing factor to poor performance. The contribution of catchment population on forecast accuracy was more ambiguous. This study determined that the factors governing RF's forecast performance are complicated and interrelated, which presents challenges for further work in this space. A sufficiently accurate further iteration of the tool discussed within this study would provide significant but varying value for public health departments for monitoring future, or ongoing outbreaks, assisting the implementation of on-time health response measures.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on economy. Decisions regarding the reopening of businesses should account for infection risks., OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a novel model for COVID-19 infection risks and policy evaluations., METHODS: The model combines the best principles of the agent-based, microexposure, and probabilistic modeling approaches. It takes into account specifics of a workplace, mask efficiency, and daily routines of employees, but does not require specific inter-agent rules for simulations. Likewise, it does not require knowledge of microscopic disease related parameters. Instead, the risk of infection is aggregated into the probability of infection, which depends on the duration and distance of every contact. The probability of infection at the end of a workday is found using rigorous probabilistic rules. Unlike previous models, this approach requires only a few reference data points for calibration, which are more easily collected via empirical studies., RESULTS: The application of the model is demonstrated for a typical office environment and for a real-world case., CONCLUSION: The proposed model allows for effective risk assessment and policy evaluation when there are large uncertainties about the disease, making it particularly suitable for COVID-19 risk assessments.

   abstract = {In most big cities, public transports are enclosed and crowded spaces. Therefore, they are considered as one of the most important triggers of COVID-19 spread. Most of the existing research related to the mobility of people and COVID-19 spread is focused on investigating highly frequented paths by analyzing data collected from mobile devices, which mainly refer to geo-positioning records. In contrast, this paper tackles the problem by studying mass mobility. The relations between daily mobility on public transport (subway or metro) in three big cities and mortality due to COVID-19 are investigated. Data collected for these purposes come from official sources, such as the web pages of the cities' local governments. To provide a systematic framework, we applied the IBM Foundational Methodology for Data Science to the epidemiological domain of this paper. Our analysis consists of moving averages with a moving window equal to seven days so as to avoid bias due to weekly tendencies. Among the main findings of this work are: a) New York City and Madrid show similar distribution on studied variables, which resemble a Gauss bell, in contrast to Mexico City, and b) Non-pharmaceutical interventions don't bring immediate results, and reductions to the number of deaths due to COVID are observed after a certain number of days. This paper yields partial evidence for assessing the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Introduction Europe was the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, with the highest number of cases and deaths between March and April. In May, the infection numbers registered a fall followed by a second new rise, not proportionally reflected by an increase in the number of deaths. We aimed to investigate the relationship between disease prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR), and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital admissions over time, to develop a predictive model, as well as appraising the potential contributing factors underpinning this complex relationship. Methods A prospective epidemiological study using data from six countries collected between 10 March and 4 September 2020. Data on the number of daily hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 were gathered, and the IFR and the prevalence were calculated. Trends over time were analysed. A linear regression model was used to determine the association between the fatality rates and the number of admissions. Findings The prediction model confirmed the linear association between the fatality rates and the numbers of ICU and hospital admissions. The exception was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the model underestimated the fatalities indicating that a substantial number of deaths occurred outside of the hospitals. The fatality rates decreased in all countries from May until September regardless of the trends in prevalence, differences in healthcare systems or strategic variations in handling the pandemic. Interpretation The observed gradual reduction in COVID-19 fatality rates over time despite varying disease prevalence and public health measures across multiple countries warrants search for a biological explanation. While our understanding of this novel virus grows, hospital and ICU admission rates remain effective predictors of patient outcomes which can be used as early warning signs for escalation of public health measures.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

   abstract = {As the COVD-19 pandemic spreads, several new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) variants with various mutations across the genome have arisen, and they appear to be the greater risk to global public health. In this study, we have performed molecular characterization of SARS-COV-2 circulating in India between January 2020 and May 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-COV-2 reported in the first and second waves of the outbreak showed the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-COV-2 that was dispersed across the evolutionary tree of SARS-COV-2 with six major next strain clades: 19A (5.3%), 20A (29.9%), 20B (24.9%), 20I-Alpha, V1 (7.4%), 21A-Delta (17.2%), and 21B-Kappa (12.7%). Among the observed clades, 21A-Delta and 21B-Kappa belonging to the B.1.617 and its sublineages are the two notable clades that dominated approximately 78% of the total SARS-COV-2 genomes reported during April and May 2021. This study has also established a link between different SARS-COV-2 variants and risk of mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic using multivariable logistic regression model for patient-level data. The estimated model demonstrates that the risk of mortality of the COVID 19 patients infected by variant B.1.617 and/or its sublineages is much higher than the other preexisting SARS-COV-2 variants, especially among individuals over 45 years of age, regardless of gender. Considering the transmissibility of the B.1.617 and its sublineages and its potential impact to the public health, real-time analysis of COVID-19 cases coupled with stringent genomics surveillance are promising tools to develop and adapt stringent measures to contain and reduce the impact of SARS-COV-2.Copyright © 2022 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

   abstract = {Human mobility is a primary driver of infectious disease spread. However, existing data is limited in availability, coverage, granularity, and timeliness. Data-driven forecasts of disease dynamics are crucial for decision-making by health officials and private citizens alike. In this work, we focus on a machine-learned anonymized mobility map (hereon referred to as AMM) aggregated over hundreds of millions of smartphones and evaluate its utility in forecasting epidemics. We factor AMM into a metapopulation model to retrospectively forecast influenza in the USA and Australia. We show that the AMM model performs on-par with those based on commuter surveys, which are sparsely available and expensive. We also compare it with gravity and radiation based models of mobility, and find that the radiation model's performance is quite similar to AMM and commuter flows. Additionally, we demonstrate our model's ability to predict disease spread even across state boundaries. Our work contributes towards developing timely infectious disease forecasting at a global scale using human mobility datasets expanding their applications in the area of infectious disease epidemiology.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Viruses},
   volume = {16},
   number = {3},
   pages = {482},
   abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is currently used to monitor not only the spread of the viral SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but also that of other viruses in endemic conditions, particularly in the absence of syndromic surveillance. The continuous monitoring of sewage requires high expenditure and significant time investments, highlighting the need for standardized methods and structured monitoring strategies. In this context, we conducted weekly wastewater monitoring in northwestern Tuscany (Italy) and targeted human adenovirus (HAdV), norovirus genogroup II (NoVggII), enterovirus (EV), and SARS-CoV-2. Samples were collected at the entrances of treatment plants and concentrated using PEG/NaCl precipitation, and viral nucleic acids were extracted and detected through real-time reverse transcription qPCR. NoVggII was the most identified target (84.4%), followed by HAdV, SARS-CoV-2, and EV. Only HAdV and EV exhibited seasonal peaks in spring and summer. Compared with data that were previously collected in the same study area (from February 2021 to September 2021), the results for SARS-CoV-2 revealed a shift from an epidemic to an endemic pattern, at least in the region under investigation, which was likely due to viral mutations that led to the spreading of new variants with increased resistance to summer environmental conditions. In conclusion, using standardized methods and an efficient monitoring strategy, WBE proves valuable for viral surveillance in pandemic and epidemic scenarios, enabling the identification of temporal-local distribution patterns that are useful for making informed public health decisions.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.},

   journal = {Statistics in medicine},
   volume = {40},
   number = {4},
   pages = {865-884},
   abstract = {The correct identification of change-points during ongoing outbreak investigations of infectious diseases is a matter of paramount importance in epidemiology, with major implications for the management of health care resources, public health and, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, social live. Onsets, peaks, and inflexion points are some of them. An onset is the moment when the epidemic starts. A "peak" indicates a moment at which the incorporated values, both before and after, are lower: a maximum. The inflexion points identify moments in which the rate of growth of the incorporation of new cases changes intensity. In this study, after interpreting the concept of elasticity of a random variable in an innovative way, we propose using it as a new simpler tool for anticipating epidemic remission change-points. In particular, we propose that the "remission point of change" will occur just at the instant when the speed in the accumulation of new cases is lower than the average speed of accumulation of cases up to that moment. This gives stability and robustness to the estimation in the event of possible remission variations. This descriptive measure, which is very easy to calculate and interpret, is revealed as informative and adequate, has the advantage of being distribution-free and can be estimated in real time, while the data is being collected. We use the 2014-2016 Western Africa Ebola virus epidemic to demonstrate this new approach. A couple of examples analyzing COVID-19 data are also included. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {To combat the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), academician and clinician are in search of new approaches to predict the COVID-19 outbreak dynamic trends that may slow down or stop the pandemic. Epidemiological models like Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and its variants are helpful to understand the dynamics trend of pandemic that may be used in decision making to optimize possible controls from the infectious disease. But these epidemiological models based on mathematical assumptions may not predict the real pandemic situation. Recently the new machine learning approaches are being used to understand the dynamic trend of COVID-19 spread. In this paper, we designed the recurrent and convolutional neural network models: vanilla LSTM, stacked LSTM, ED_LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, and hybrid CNN+LSTM model to capture the complex trend of COVID-19 outbreak and perform the forecasting of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases of 7, 14, 21 days for India and its four most affected states (Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu). The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation metric are computed on the testing data to demonstrate the relative performance of these models. The results show that the stacked LSTM and hybrid CNN+LSTM models perform best relative to other models. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Infectious Disease Modelling},
   volume = {5},
   pages = {608-621},
   abstract = {Background: Due to uncertainties encompassing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, mathematical models informing the trajectory of disease are being proposed throughout the world. Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess health system preparedness in tandem with need projections for comprehensive outlook. Objective(s): We attempted this study to forecast the need for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in need due to COVID-19. Method(s): We employed age-structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the need under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of containment and mitigation strategies. Correspondingly, data on health resources was collated from various government records. Further, we computed daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. Finding(s): Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in need during peak of epidemic. Also, model suggests that continuing strict lockdown measures in India after mid-May 2020 would have been ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly. Augmenting testing to 1,500,000 tests per day during projected peak (mid-September) under social-distancing measures and current test to positive rate of 9.7% would lead to more documented cases (60, 000, 000 to 90, 000, 000) culminating to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 13x, 70x and 37x times more beds for mild cases, ICU beds and mechanical ventilators respectively would be required to commensurate with need under that scenario. However, if testing capacity is limited to 9,000,000 tests per day (current situation as of 19th August 2020) under continued social-distancing measures, documented cases would plummet significantly, still requiring 5x, 31x and 16x times the current allocated resources (beds for mild cases, ICU beds and mechanical ventilators respectively) to meet unmet need for COVID-19 treatment in India.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

   abstract = {Objectives: To understand and forecast the evolution of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in Chile, and analyze alternative simulated scenarios to better predict alternative paths, in order to implement policy solutions to stop the spread and minimize damage. Method(s): We have specified a novel multi-parameter generalized logistic growth model, which does not only look at the trend of the data, but also includes explanatory covariates, using a quasi-Poisson regression specification to account for overdispersion of the count data. We fitted our model to data from the onset of the disease (February 28) until September 15. Estimating the parameters from our model, we predicted the growth of the epidemic for the evolution of the disease until the end of October 2020. We also evaluated via simulations different fictional scenarios for the outcome of alternative policies (those analyses are included in the Supplementary Material). Results and Conclusion(s): The evolution of the disease has not followed an exponential growth, but rather, stabilized and moved downward after July 2020, starting to increase again after the implementation of the Step-by-Step policy. The lockdown policy implemented in the majority of the country has proven effective in stopping the spread, and the lockdown-relaxation policies, however gradual, appear to have caused an upward break in the trend.Copyright © 2021 Vicuna, Vasquez and Quiroga.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impacts on the residential aged care sector, whereby outbreaks were the cause of disproportionate morbidity and mortality among the high-risk resident population. The first outbreaks in New South Wales residential aged care facilities (RACF) occurred in mid-2020, however it was not until the widespread permeation of the COVID-19 Delta variant in July 2021 that RACF outbreaks accelerated exponentially. Many areas, like Western Sydney, became epicentres for both community and RACF outbreaks of COVID-19, and this necessitated commensurately aggressive public health and outbreak management responses. Outbreak management teams (OMTs) - a multidisciplinary coordination of aged care workers, nurses, infection control professionals, public health physicians and specialists - became central to the pandemic response in Western Sydney RACFs. This study explored the OMT response to COVID-19 outbreaks in Western Sydney RACFs during the initial Delta variant COVID-19 outbreak (June-October 2021), as well as its long-term impact over the subsequent course of pandemic as new variants emerged. Guided by the Donabedian framework, this study employed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods design to define and evaluate the structure, processes, and outcomes of the OMT response. We synthesize comprehensive clinical, epidemiological, and administrative datasets collected from facilities during the RACF outbreaks together with in-depth interviews from the facility managers and OMT members who were directly involved. Our findings provide critical insight into the capabilities, capacities, and challenges of deploying OMTs in aged care settings during pandemics and how this powerful model of care can be better utilized to prepare for future emergencies.Copyright © 2023},

   abstract = {When it comes to pandemics, such as the one caused by the Coronavirus disease COVID-19, various issues and problems have arisen for the healthcare infrastructure and institutions. With increasing number of patients in need of urgent medical care and hospitalizations, the healthcare systems and regional hospitals may approach their maximum service capacity and may face shortage of various parameters, such as supplies including PPE, medications, therapeutic devices, ventilators, beds, and many more. The article at hand describes the development and framework of a simulation model that enables the modeling and evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic progress. To achieve this, the model dynamically mimics and simulates the developments and time-dependent behavior of various crucial parameters of the pandemic, among others, the daily infection numbers and death rate. In addition, the model enables the simulation of single events and scenarios that occur outside of the regular pandemic developments as anomalies, such as holidays. Unlike traditional models, the proposed framework is based on factors and parameters closely derived from reality, such as the contact rate of individuals, which allows for a much more realistic representation. In addition, the real connection enables the assessment of effects of various influences regarding the development and progress of the pandemic, such as hospitalization numbers over time. All the aforementioned points are possible within the simulation framework and do not require awaiting the unfolding of the effects in reality. Thus, the model is capable of dynamically predicting how different scenarios turn out. The abilities of the model are demonstrated, illustrated, and proven in a specific case study that shows the impact of holidays, such as Passover and Easter in New York City when quarantine measures might have been ignored, and an increase in extended family gatherings temporarily occurred. As a result, the simulation showed significant impacts and disproportionate number of patients in need of medical care that could be potentially detrimental in reality. For example, compared to the previous trajectory of the pandemic, for a temporary increase of 50% in the contact rate of individuals, the model showed that the total number of cases would increase by 461 090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations would rise to 79 733, and the total number of fatalities would climb by 19 125 over 90 days. In addition to its function and proven capabilities, the model can and is furthermore planned to be adapted to other areas, not necessarily only metropolitan regions in order to expand the utilization of its predictive power. Such predictions could be used to derive regulatory measures and to test various policies for COVID-19 containment. Copyright © IEEE 2021.},

   abstract = {Background: Public health measures for COVID-19 containment have implied economic and social life disruptions, which have been particularly deleterious in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to high rates of informal employment, overcrowding, and barriers to accessing health services, amongst others social determinants. Mexico, a LMIC, is a country with a high COVID-19 mortality in which there has been a very limited governmental response to help mitigate such COVID-related disruptions. This study analyzes the association of the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in Mexico with four well-being indicators: income, employment, anxiety, and food security. Method(s): It uses pooled cross-sectional data (n = 5453) of five monthly nationally representative surveys collected between April and August 2020. Probit models are estimated to assess the association of the pandemic with job loss and anxiety; a multinomial logistic regression is estimated for food security, and an ordinary least squares regression assesses the association between the pandemic and changes in household's income. Result(s): Females were significantly associated with worse outcomes for the 4 well-being measures with an average reduction of 2.3% in household income compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, an increased probability (6.4 pp) of being in a household that had lost jobs, decreased probability of food security (6.9 pp), and an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (8.5 pp). In addition, those with lower SES and household with children also reported worse outcomes for employment, income and food security. The month variable was also statistically significant in these models suggesting that as more months of the pandemic elapsed the effects persisted. Conclusion(s): The currents study documents how the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with different well-being indicators in a LMIC. It suggests the urgent need to take actions to support vulnerable groups, particularly women, households with children and those in the lowest SES. If policy actions are not taken, the pandemic will increase social and gender disparities, and will jeopardize childhood development.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Describe the perceptions of key actors regarding the disruption of health services for populations that ceased to be prioritized because of the COVID-19 pandemic-pregnant women, newborn, children, adolescents, and women-in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) during the first stage of the pandemic., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a 35-question survey was administered to key actors in 19 LAC countries between July and September 2020. The respondents were asked for their personal perceptions regarding the situation of social and health services in their country before and during the pandemic. They were also asked for a projection of the situation during the post-pandemic period., RESULTS: In the 691 responses received, the main perception was that coverage in the services analyzed had been high before the pandemic, although their quality was not as highly rated. Both the coverage and quality of services were thought to have declined for adolescents and women. The majority of respondents predicted that all services will continue to function at lower than usual coverage levels for another three months (53.1%) and another 12 months (41.3%). Guaranteeing coverage and access to health services was considered the main policy challenge going forward. The next most needed initiatives noted were financing for actions to support women, children, and adolescents, and protection against violence and promotion of measures to combat it., CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic has struck all countries, its effect on the delivery of services in the populations analyzed differs from country to country and according to the types of service. It is essential to invest in national information systems that will make it possible to monitor the different services and identify the populations that need to be prioritized.},

   abstract = {This project is funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) through their NSF RAPID program under the title "Modeling Corona Spread Using Big Data Analytics." The project is a joint effort between the Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at FAU and a research group from LexisNexis Risk Solutions. The novel coronavirus Covid-19 originated in China in early December 2019 and has rapidly spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day. Covid-19 is officially a pandemic. It is a novel infection with serious clinical manifestations, including death, and it has reached at least 124 countries and territories. Although the ultimate course and impact of Covid-19 are uncertain, it is not merely possible but likely that the disease will produce enough severe illness to overwhelm the worldwide health care infrastructure. Emerging viral pandemics can place extraordinary and sustained demands on public health and health systems and on providers of essential community services. Modeling the Covid-19 pandemic spread is challenging. But there are data that can be used to project resource demands. Estimates of the reproductive number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 show that at the beginning of the epidemic, each infected person spreads the virus to at least two others, on average (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020, Livingston and Bucher in JAMA 323(14):1335, 2020). A conservatively low estimate is that 5 % of the population could become infected within 3 months. Preliminary data from China and Italy regarding the distribution of case severity and fatality vary widely (Wu and McGoogan in JAMA 323(13):1239-42, 2020). A recent large-scale analysis from China suggests that 80 % of those infected either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms; a finding that implies that demand for advanced medical services might apply to only 20 % of the total infected. Of patients infected with Covid-19, about 15 % have severe illness and 5 % have critical illness (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020). Overall, mortality ranges from 0.25 % to as high as 3.0 % (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020, Wilson et al. in Emerg Infect Dis 26(6):1339, 2020). Case fatality rates are much higher for vulnerable populations, such as persons over the age of 80 years (> 14 %) and those with coexisting conditions (10 % for those with cardiovascular disease and 7 % for those with diabetes) (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020). Overall, Covid-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza, which has a mortality of roughly 0.1 %. Public health efforts depend heavily on predicting how diseases such as those caused by Covid-19 spread across the globe. During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them. These computational methods use known statistical equations that calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness. Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as a given disease's ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people traveling by air and land. This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual's exact travel pattern. By plugging in different possible versions of each input, however, researchers can update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns for the illness. In this paper we describe the development a model of Corona spread by using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. We leveraged our experience from research in modeling Ebola spread (Shaw et al. Modeling Ebola Spread and Using HPCC/KEL System. In: Big Data Technologies and Applications 2016 (pp. 347-385). Springer, Cham) to successfully model Corona spread, we will obtain new results, and help in reducing the number of orona patients. We closely collaborated with LexisNexis, which is a leading US data analytics company and a member of our NSF I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement. The lack of a comprehensive view and informative analysis of the status of the pandemic can also cause panic and instability within society. Our work proposes the HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker, which provides a multi-level view of the pandemic with the informative virus spreading indicators in a timely manner. The system embeds a classical epidemiological model known as SIR and spreading indicators based on causal model. The data solution of the tracker is built on top of the Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems, from ingesting and tracking of various data sources to fast delivery of the data to the public. The HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker presents the Covid-19 data on a daily, weekly, and cumulative basis up to global-level and down to the county-level. It also provides statistical analysis for each level such as new cases per 100,000 population. The primary analysis such as Contagion Risk and Infection State is based on causal model with a seven-day sliding window. Our work has been released as a publicly available website to the world and attracted a great volume of traffic. The project is open-sourced and available on GitHub. The system was developed on the LexisNexis HPCC Systems, which is briefly described in the paper. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.},

   abstract = {Background: Little is known about sexual minority adults' willingness to use digital health tools, such as pandemic-related tools for screening and tracking, outside of HIV prevention and intervention efforts for sexual minority men, specifically. Additionally, given the current cultural climate in the United States, heterosexual and sexual minority adults may differ in their willingness to use digital health tools, and there may be within-group differences among sexual minority adults. Objective(s): This study compared sexual minority and heterosexual adults' willingness to use COVID-19-related digital health tools for public health screening and tracking and tested whether sexual minority adults differed from each other by age group, gender, and race or ethnicity. Method(s): We analyzed data from a cross-sectional, national probability survey (n=2047) implemented from May 30 to June 8, 2020, in the United States during the height of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using latent-variable modeling, heterosexual and sexual minority adults were tested for differences in their willingness to use digital health tools for public health screening and tracking. Among sexual minority adults, specifically, associations with age, gender, and race or ethnicity were assessed. Result(s): On average, sexual minority adults showed greater willingness to use digital health tools for screening and tracking than heterosexual adults (latent factor mean difference 0.46, 95% CI 0.15-0.77). Among sexual minority adults, there were no differences by age group, gender, or race or ethnicity. However, African American (b=0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.62), Hispanic or Latino (b=0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.55), and other racial or ethnic minority (b=0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.77) heterosexual adults showed greater willingness to use digital health tools for screening and tracking than White heterosexual adults. Conclusion(s): In the United States, sexual minority adults were more willing to use digital health tools for screening and tracking than heterosexual adults. Sexual minority adults did not differ from each other by age, gender, or race or ethnicity in terms of their willingness to use these digital health tools, so no sexual orientation-based or intersectional disparities were identified. Furthermore, White heterosexual adults were less willing to use these tools than racial or ethnic minority heterosexual adults. Findings support the use of digital health tools with sexual minority adults, which could be important for other public health-related concerns (eg, the recent example of mpox). Additional studies are needed regarding the decision-making process of White heterosexual adults regarding the use of digital health tools to address public health crises, including pandemics or outbreaks that disproportionately affect minoritized populations.Copyright ©Wilson Vincent.

   abstract = {(1) Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak in the Lazio region, a surge in emergency medical service (EMS) calls has been observed. The objective of present study is to investigate if there is any correlation between the variation in numbers of daily EMS calls, and the short-term evolution of the epidemic wave. (2) Methods: Data from the COVID-19 outbreak has been retrieved in order to draw the epidemic curve in the Lazio region. Data from EMS calls has been used in order to determine Excess of Calls (ExCa) in the 2020-2021 years, compared to the year 2019 (baseline). Multiple linear regression models have been run between ExCa and the first-order derivative (D') of the epidemic wave in time, each regression model anticipating the epidemic progression (up to 14 days), in order to probe a correlation between the variables. (3) Results: EMS calls variation from baseline is correlated with the slope of the curve of ICU admissions, with the most fitting value found at 7 days (R2 0.33, p < 0.001). (4) Conclusion(s): EMS calls deviation from baseline allows public health services to predict short-term epidemic trends in COVID-19 outbreaks, and can be used as validation of current data, or as an independent estimator of future trends.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Background: Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) practices always have been neglected among HIV/AIDS (Human immunodeficiency virus/ Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) programs, even when HIV and WaSH services have robust bearing on each other. With COVID-19 pandemic on the go, it is utmost necessary for the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) to ensure adequate WaSH practices., Objective: This study was carried out with an objective to assess baseline WaSH practices among PLHA and to find out if any association between nutritional status and WaSH parameters so as to identify the shortcomings and highlight the importance of WaSH practices among PLHAs and give suitable recommendations to program managers., Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out among PLHA registered in ART centres of western Maharashtra. A sample size of 378 consented to be part of the study were included in the study, by means of systematic random sampling. Data were collected by means of pretested questionnaire prepared from guidelines and previous studies. Institutional ethical clearance was obtained and informed consent was taken from study participants before data collection. Strict confidentiality was maintained throughout the study period., Results: When asked about the water processing method, 76% of them told they do not treat/process the water supplied to them. In contrast, only a few PLHA told they would filter (17%), boil (7%), and use aquaguard (1%). The majority (67%) had their latrines, and while 29% of them were using public latrines and its hygienic sanitation was a concern for them and 4% were still practising open-air defecation in rural areas. Almost all study participants were handwashing after toilet use and handwashing before consuming food. The majority (79%) told they used soap and water, while 20% were using only water, soil and water (1%) and ash and water (1%) which was a concern. Of all the households, 87% cooked their food twice and consumed it thrice a day, while 4% prepared thrice. 10% of them cooked only once and consumed thrice a day; 56% practised consumption of leftover food of the previous night which was a concern. A majority (54%) did not consume street food while remaining said that they used to consume street food. But majority (59%) said they did not follow the habit of checking hygiene or sanitation of hotel where they used to consume food while the remaining 41% did not check the hotel before ordering the food; 50% of them bought packaged milk while 40.9% brought from unpasteurized dairy. On analysis, hygiene and sanitation factors had no statistically significant association with the nutritional status of study participants., Conclusion: WaSH factors act synergistically with other factors to affect the holistic health of PLHA. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities (continuous and regular), that focus on improving awareness level on WaSH practices, need to be promoted and integrated into HIV program, including providing basic care packages to PLHA like household water treatment products and soap, etc., Such measures will go a long way in maintaining health of PLHA even during ongoing COVID-19 pandemic scenario.

   abstract = {The declaration of any public health emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is usually followed by the provision of technical and organizational support from international organizations, which build a parallel and short-time healthcare emergency response centered on preventing the extension of health emergencies across the countries and over the world. Previous Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have highlighted the need to reinforce the healthcare sector in different countries. Based on the difficulty to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) to the local level of affected countries including the DRC, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary model based on the health zones through the strengthening of preparedness and response structures to public health emergencies vis-a-vis the existing weak health systems existing in DRC. A commitment to integrating the emergency response in the existing health system should work to reduce the tension that exists between local recruitment and its impact on the quality of daily healthcare in the region affected by EVD outbreak on one hand, and the involvement of international recruitment and its impact on the trust of the population on the emergency response on the other. This paper highlights the provision of a local healthcare workforce skilled to treat infectious diseases, the compulsory implementation of training programs focused on the emergency response in countries commonly affected by EVD outbreaks including the DRC. These innovations should reduce the burden of health problems prior to and in the aftermath of any public health emergency in DRC hence increasing the wellbeing of the community, especially the vulnerable people as well as the availability of trained healthcare providers able to early recognize and treat EVD.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis},
   abstract = {Prevention behaviors are important in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19. The protection motivation theory (PMT) links perceptions of risk and coping ability with the act of adopting prevention behaviors. The goal of this research is to test the application of the PMT in predicting adoption of prevention behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two research objectives are achieved to explore motivating factors for adopting prevention behaviors. (1) The first objective is to identify variables that are strong predictors of prevention behavior adoption. A data-driven approach is used to train Bayesian belief network (BBN) models using results of a survey of N = 7797 $N=7797$ participants reporting risk perceptions and prevention behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A large set of models are generated and analyzed to identify significant variables. (2) The second objective is to develop models based on the PMT to predict prevention behaviors. BBN models that predict prevention behaviors were developed using two approaches. In the first approach, a data-driven methodology trains models using survey data alone. In the second approach, expert knowledge is used to develop the structure of the BBN using PMT constructs. Results demonstrate that trust and experience with COVID-19 were important predictors for prevention measure adoption. Models that were developed using the PMT confirm relationships between coping appraisal, threat appraisal, and protective behaviors. Data-driven and PMT-based models perform similarly well, confirming the use of PMT in this context. Predicting adoption of social distancing behaviors provides insight for developing policies during pandemics. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

   abstract = {We study an SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model due to Young et al. (2019) for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The simple subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave (short delay) approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how a well executed temporary phase of social distancing can reduce the total number of people affected. The reduction can be by as much as half for a weak pandemic, and is smaller but still substantial for stronger pandemics. An explicit formula for the greatest possible reduction is given.

   journal = {Viruses},
   volume = {15},
   number = {12},
   pages = {2299},
   abstract = {This study proposes a modification of the GeoCity model previously developed by the authors, detailing the age structure of the population, personal schedule on weekdays and working days, and individual health characteristics of the agents. This made it possible to build a more realistic model of the functioning of the city and its residents. The developed model made it possible to simulate the spread of three types of strain of the COVID-19 virus, and to analyze the adequacy of this model in the case of unhindered spread of the virus among city residents. Calculations based on the proposed model show that SARS-CoV 2 spreads mainly from contacts in workplaces and transport, and schoolchildren and preschool children are the recipients, not the initiators of the epidemic. The simulations showed that fluctuations in the dynamics of various indicators of the spread of SARS-CoV 2 were associated with the difference in the daily schedule on weekdays and weekends. The results of the calculations showed that the daily schedules of people strongly influence the spread of SARS-CoV 2. Under assumptions of the model, the results show that for the more contagious "rapid" strains of SARS-CoV 2 (omicron), immunocompetent people become a significant source of infection. For the less contagious "slow strains" (alpha) of SARS-CoV 2, the most active source of infection is immunocompromised individuals (pregnant women). The more contagious, or "fast" strain of the SARS-CoV 2 virus (omicron), spreads faster in public transport. For less contagious, or "slow" strains of the virus (alpha), the greatest infection occurs due to work and educational contacts.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: Delayed evaluation of stroke may contribute to COVID-19 pandemic-related morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated patient characteristics, process measures and outcomes associated with the decline in stroke presentation during the early pandemic. Method(s): Volumes of stroke presentations, intravenous thrombolytic administrations, and mechanical thrombectomies from 52 hospitals from January 1-June 30, 2020 were analyzed with piecewise linear regression and linear spline models. Univariate analysis compared pandemic (case) and pre-pandemic (control) groups defined in relation to the nadir of daily strokes during the study period. Significantly different patient characteristics were further evaluated with logistic regression, and significantly different process measures and outcomes were re-analyzed after propensity score matching. Result(s): Analysis of 7,389 patients found daily stroke volumes decreased 0.91/day from March 12-26 (p < 0.0001), reaching a nadir 35.0% less than expected, and increased 0.15 strokes/day from March 27-June 23, 2020 (p < 0.0001). Intravenous thrombolytic administrations decreased 3.3/week from February 19-March 31 (p = 0.0023), reaching a nadir 33.4% less than expected, and increased 1.4 administrations/week from April 1-June 23 (p < 0.0001). Mechanical thrombectomy volumes decreased by 1.5/week from February 19-March 31, 2020 (p = 0.0039), reaching a nadir 11.3% less than expected. The pandemic group was more likely to ambulate independently at baseline (p = 0.02, OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.08-2.42), and less likely to present with mild stroke symptoms (NIH Stroke Scale <= 5; p = 0.04, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.02). Process measures and outcomes of each group did not differ, including door-to-needle time, door-to-puncture time, and successful mechanical thrombectomy rate. Conclusion(s): Stroke presentations and acute interventions decreased during the early COVID-19 pandemic, at least in part due to patients with lower baseline functional status and milder symptoms not seeking medical care. Public health messaging and initiatives should target these populations.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {The 2019 coronavirus pandemic exudes public health and socio-economic burden globally, raising an unprecedented concern for infectious diseases. Thus, describing the infectious disease transmission process to design effective intervention measures and restrict its spread is a critical scientific issue. We propose a level-dependent Markov model with infinite state space to characterize viral disorders like COVID-19. The levels and states in this model represent the stages of outbreak development and the possible number of infectious disease patients. The transfer of states between levels reflects the explosive transmission process of infectious disease. A simulation method with heterogeneous infection is proposed to solve the model rapidly. After that, simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB according to the reported data on COVID-19 published by Johns Hopkins. Comparing the simulation results with the actual situation shows that our proposed model can well capture the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with and without imposed interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Further, the influence of model parameters on transmission dynamics is analyzed, which helps to develop reasonable intervention strategies. The proposed approach extends the theoretical study of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and contributes to developing models that can describe an infinite number of infected persons.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Mustafa.

   abstract = {An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

   volume = {11},
   pages = {1112547},
   abstract = {Big data technology plays an important role in the prevention and control of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Current studies on model construction, such as SIR infectious disease model, 4R crisis management model, etc., have put forward decision-making suggestions from different perspectives, which also provide a reference basis for the research in this paper. This paper conducts an exploratory study on the construction of a big data prevention and control model for public health emergencies by using the grounded theory, a qualitative research method, with literature, policies, and regulations as research samples, and makes a grounded analysis through three-level coding and saturation test. Main results are as follows: (1) The three elements of data layer, subject layer, and application layer play a prominent role in the digital prevention and control practice of epidemic in China and constitute the basic framework of the "DSA" model. (2) The "DSA" model integrates cross-industry, cross-region, and cross-domain epidemic data into one system framework, effectively solving the disadvantages of fragmentation caused by "information island". (3) The "DSA" model analyzes the differences in information needs of different subjects during an outbreak and summarizes several collaborative approaches to promote resource sharing and cooperative governance. (4) The "DSA" model analyzes the specific application scenarios of big data technology in different stages of epidemic development, effectively responding to the disconnection between current technological development and realistic needs.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Ye and Liu.},

   abstract = {Background: Novel coronavirus pneumonia has been the most serious worldwide public health emergency since being identified in December 2019. The rapid spread of the pandemic and the strong human to human infection rate of COVID-19 poses a great prevention challenge. There has been an explosion in the number of confirmed cases in several cities near Wuhan, including the highest in Honghu, Jinzhou. Owing to the limited admission capacity and medical resources, increasing numbers of suspected cases of COVID-19 infection were difficult to confirm or treat. Case presentation: Following the arrival of the Guangdong medical aid team on 11 February, 2020, COVID-19 care in Honghu saw changes after a series of solutions were implemented based on the 'Four-Early' and 'Four-centralization' management measures. The 'Four-Early' measures are: early detection, early reporting, early quarantine, and early treatment for meeting an urgent need like the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Four-centralization' refers to the way in which recruited medical teams can make full use of medical resources to give patients the best treatment. These solutions successfully increased the recovery rate and reduced mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Honghu. Conclusion(s): This management strategy is called the 'Honghu Model' which can be generalized to enable the prevention and management of COVID-19 worldwide.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19 hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID- 19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human activities on the transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable (above 94%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the spread of COVID- 19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google Community Mobility Reports.},

In January 2021, 200 participants under 50 years of age, located in 80 Chinese cities, participated in an online survey assessing risk perception, compliance with preventive behaviors, fear, anxiety, political trust, government dependency, and dispositional optimism. The results showed that the effect of risk perception on compliance with preventive behaviors was mediated by political trust and fear, and was moderated by government dependency. Anxiety and fear serially mediated the effect of optimism on compliance with preventive behaviors. Our study provided implications for future research to reduce negative emotions, strengthen confidence in the government, and sustain mod-erate government dependency accompanied by individual self-efficacy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   pages = {186},
   abstract = {The Chinese government relaxed the Zero-COVID policy on Dec 15, 2022, and reopened the border on Jan 8, 2023. Therefore, COVID prevention in China is facing new challenges. Though there are plenty of prior studies on COVID, none is regarding the predictions on daily confirmed cases, and medical resources needs after China reopens its borders. To fill this gap, this study innovates a combination of the Erdos Renyl network, modified computational model [Formula: see text], and python code instead of only mathematical formulas or computer simulations in the previous studies. The research background in this study is Shanghai, a representative city in China. Therefore, the results in this study also demonstrate the situation in other regions of China. According to the population distribution and migration characteristics, we divided Shanghai into six epidemic research areas. We built a COVID spread model of the Erodos Renyl network. And then, we use python code to simulate COVID spread based on modified [Formula: see text] model. The results demonstrate that the second and third waves will occur in July-September and Oct-Dec, respectively. At the peak of the epidemic in 2023, the daily confirmed cases will be 340,000, and the cumulative death will be about 31,500. Moreover, 74,000 hospital beds and 3,700 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds will be occupied in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai faces a shortage of medical resources. In this simulation, daily confirmed cases predictions significantly rely on transmission, migration, and waning immunity rate. The study builds a mixed-effect model to verify further the three parameters' effect on the new confirmed cases. The results demonstrate that migration and waning immunity rates are two significant parameters in COVID spread and daily confirmed cases. This study offers theoretical evidence for the government to prevent COVID after China opened its borders.Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {With the rapid development of internet information technology, online public opinion's influence is infinitely magnified, seriously threatening social security and national governance. It is significant to clarify the spatial and temporal evolution rules of online public opinion on major epidemics and its influencing factors for the governance and guidance of online public opinion on major epidemics. In this paper, the spatiotemporal evolution analysis model of online public opinion and an analysis model of influencing factors were constructed. We selected the Baidu index and microblog crawler text data at the early stage of COVID-19 as the research objects and analyzed the evolution of online public opinion during the time period by using the optimal segmentation method, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and text analysis method. The spatiotemporal evolutionary influences and their influence are further analyzed using the geographic probe factor detection method. The results showed that the evolution of online public opinion in the early stage of the epidemic was closely related to the event's evolution and the prevention and control effect. In the time dimension, the early evolution of online public opinion has prominent periodic characteristics. In the geospatial dimension, there are significant spatial agglomeration effects and spillover effects. In the cyberspace dimension, there are significant differences in online public opinion heat, hot topics, and netizens' emotional tendencies at different stages. Furthermore, the severity of the epidemic, the number of Internet users, the number of media reports and the region's attributes jointly affect the spatial and temporal evolution pattern of online public opinions about the epidemic. The research results provide decision-making references for the government and planners to effectively manage online public opinion on emergencies and improve the government's public opinion governance capacity and level.

   abstract = {In this paper, with the method of epidemic dynamics, we assess the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 after the policy adjustment of prevention and control measure in December 2022 in Taiyuan City in China, and estimate the excess population deaths caused by COVID-19. Based on the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 among individuals, a dynamic model with heterogeneous contacts is established to describe the change of control measures and the population's social behavior in Taiyuan city. The model is verified and simulated by basing on reported case data from November 8th to December 5th, 2022 in Taiyuan city and the statistical data of the questionnaire survey from December 1st to 23rd, 2022 in Neijiang city. Combining with reported numbers of permanent residents and deaths from 2017 to 2021 in Taiyuan city, we apply the dynamic model to estimate theoretical population of 2022 under the assumption that there is no effect of COVID-19. In addition, we carry out sensitivity analysis to determine the propagation character of the Omicron strain and the effect of the control measures. As a result of the study, it is concluded that after adjusting the epidemic policy on December 6th, 2022, three peaks of infection in Taiyuan are estimated to be from December 22nd to 31st, 2022, from May 10th to June 1st, 2023, and from September 5th to October 13th, 2023, and the corresponding daily peaks of new cases can reach 400 000, 44 000 and 22 000, respectively. By the end of 2022, excess deaths can range from 887 to 4887, and excess mortality rate can range from 3.06% to 14.82%. The threshold of the infectivity of the COVID-19 variant is estimated 0.0353, that is if the strain infectivity is above it, the epidemic cannot be control with the previous normalization measures.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses a serious threat to global public health and economics. Serial interval (SI), time between the onset of symptoms of a primary case and a secondary case, is a key epidemiological parameter. We estimated SI of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China based on 27 records of transmission chains. We adopted three parametric models: Weibull, lognormal and gamma distributions, and an interval-censored likelihood framework. The three models were compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the logistic growth model to estimate the reproduction number. Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated the mean SI to be 5.9 days (95% CI: 3.9-9.6) with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.8 days (95% CI: 3.1-10.1). Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen to be 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8). The SI of COVID-19 is relatively shorter than that of SARS and MERS, the other two betacoronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission may be rapid. Thus, it is crucial to isolate close contacts promptly to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

   abstract = {Background: Since the first appearance in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed serious threats to the public health in many Chinese places and overseas. It is essential to quantify the transmissibility on real-time basis for designing public health responses. Method(s): We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in China, Hubei province and Wuhan city by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. We compare the average reproduction numbers in different periods of time to explore the effectiveness of the public health control measures against the COVID-19 epidemic. Result(s): We estimated the reproduction numbers at 2.61 (95% CI: 2.47-2.75), 2.76 (95% CI: 2.54-2.95) and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.43-3.01) for China, Hubei province and Wuhan respectively. We found that the reproduction number largely dropped after the city lockdown. As of February 16, the three reproduction numbers further reduced to 0.98, 1.14 and 1.41 respectively. Conclusion(s): The control of COVID-19 epidemic was effective in substantially reducing the disease transmissibility in terms of the reproduction number in China reduced to 0.98 as of February 16. At the same time, the reproduction number in Wuhan was probably still larger than 1, and thus the enhancement in the public health control was recommended to maintain.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

   abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a serious global public health crisis. A major control challenge is its multiple transmission modes. This paper aims to simulate the transmission patterns of ZIKV using a dynamic process-based epidemiological model written in ordinary differential equations, which incorporates the human-to-mosquito infection by bites and sewage, mosquito-to-human infection by bites, and human-to-human infection by sex. Mathematical analyses are carried out to calculate the basic reproduction number and backward bifurcation, and prove the existence and stability of the equilibria. The model is validated with infection data by applying it to the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic in Brazil. The results indicate that the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.13, in which the contributions by mosquito bite, sex and sewage account for 85.7%, 3.5% and 10.8%, respectively. This number and the morbidity rate are most sensitive to parameters related to mosquito ecology, rather than asymptomatic or human-to-human transmission. Multiple transmission routes and suitable temperature exacerbate ZIKV infection in Brazil, and the vast majority of human infection cases were prevented by the intervention implemented. These findings may provide new insights to improve the risk assessment of ZIKV infection.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).},

METHOD(S): This paper adopts a widely accepted qualitative research and coding method to form an analysis on word materials. RESULT(S): Although Chinese CDC didn't work effectively in the early stages on risk identification and warning, China was able to respond quickly and successfully to this medical emergency after the initial shock of the awareness of a novel epidemic with a swift implementation of national-scale health emergency management. CONCLUSION(S): The success in fighting against COVID-19 in China can be attributed to: 1) adaptable governance to changing situations; 2) culture of moral compliance with rules; 3) trusted collaboration between government and people; 4) an advanced technical framework ABCD+5G (A-Artificial intelligence; B-Block chain; C-Cloud computing; D-Big data). Implications for public health: This paper constructs a conceptual model for pandemic management based on the lessons and experiences of fighting COVID-19 in China.

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), a newly emerging disease in China, posed a public health emergency of China. Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak.},

   abstract = {Objective. Infectious diseases usually spread rapidly. This study aims to develop a model that can provide fine-grained early warnings of infectious diseases using real hospital data combined with disease transmission characteristics, weather, and other multi-source data. Methods. Based on daily data reported for infectious diseases collected from several large general hospitals in China between 2012 and 2020, seven common infectious diseases in medical institutions were screened and a multi self-regression deep (MSRD) neural network was constructed. Using a recurrent neural network as the basic structure, the model can effectively model the epidemiological trend of infectious diseases by considering the current influencing conditions while taking into account the historical development characteristics in time-series data. The fitting and prediction accuracy of the model were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error. Results. The proposed approach is significantly better than the existing infectious disease dynamics model, susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR), as it addresses the concerns of difficult-to-obtain quantitative data such as latent population, overfitting of long time series, and considering only a single series of the number of sick people without considering the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases. We also compare certain machine learning methods in this study. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an MAE of 0.6928 and 1.3782 for hand, foot, and mouth disease and influenza, respectively. Conclusion. The MRSD-based infectious disease prediction model proposed in this paper can provide daily and instantaneous updates and accurate predictions for epidemic trends.Copyright © 2022 Mengying Wang et al.},

   volume = {167},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is the most serious public health event of the 21st century and has had a huge impact across the world. The spatio-temporal pattern analysis and simulation of epidemic spread have become the focus of current research. LSTM model has made a lot of achievements in the prediction of infectious diseases by virtue of its advantages in time prediction, but lacks the spatial expression. CA model plays an important role in epidemic spatial propagation modeling due to its unique evolution characteristics from local to global. However, no existing studies of CA have considered long-term dependence due to the impact of time changes on the evolution of the epidemic, and few have modeled using location data from actual diagnosed patients. Therefore, we proposed a LSTM-CA model to solve above mentioned problems. Base on the advantages of LSTM in temporal level and CA in spatial level, LSTM and CA are integrated from the spatio-temporal perspective of geography based on the fine-grained characteristics of epidemic data. The method divides the study area into regular grids, simulates the spatial interactions between neighborhood cells with the help of CA model, and extracts the parameters affecting the transition probability in CA with the help of LSTM model to assist evolution. Simulations are conducted in Python 3.4 to model the propagation of COVID-19 between Feb, 6 to Mar 20, 2020 in China. Experimental results show that, LSTM-CA performs a higher statistical accuracy than LSTM and spatial accuracy than CA, which could demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. This method could be universal for the temporal and spatial transmission of major public health events. Especially in the early stage of the epidemic, we can quickly understand its development trend and cycle, so as to provide an important reference for epidemic prevention and control and public sentiment counseling.

This study aimed to scrutinize the influence of Type A personality on the biochemical indicators of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the behavioral indicators of appetite and sleep disorder, and to analyze the mediating effect of depression. Meanwhile, multiple-group path analysis was used to evaluate path differences between the models of two samples. The results of the mediation analysis for both samples demonstrated that depression significantly mediated the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder. The results of multiple-group path analysis showed that the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder seems to be significantly stronger in ordinary people, whereas the relationship between depression and appetite and sleep disorder, as well as with the path towards AST, seems to be significantly stronger in frontline anti-epidemic medical staff. This paper provides ideas for the selection and distribution of medical personnel based on personality characteristics in major public health emergencies, and physical and mental health status should be taken into account to provide relative health assistance.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern over the past 3 years, leading to adverse effects on front-line healthcare workers. This study aimed to develop a Body Mass Index (BMI) change prediction model among doctors and nurses in North China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and further identified the predicting effects of lifestyles, sleep quality, work-related conditions, and personality traits on BMI change., Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study conducted in North China, during May-August 2022. A total of 5,400 doctors and nurses were randomly recruited from 39 COVID-19 designated hospitals and 5,271 participants provided valid responses. Participants ' data related to social-demographics, dietary behavior, lifestyle, sleep, personality, and work-related conflicts were collected with questionnaires. Deep Neural Network (DNN) was applied to develop a BMI change prediction model among doctors and nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic., Results: Of participants, only 2,216 (42.0%) individuals kept a stable BMI. Results showed that personality traits, dietary behaviors, lifestyles, sleep quality, burnout, and work-related conditions had effects on the BMI change among doctors and nurses. The prediction model for BMI change was developed with a 33-26-20-1 network framework. The DNN model achieved high prediction efficacy, and values of R 2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE for the model were 0.940, 0.027, 0.002, and 0.038, respectively. Among doctors and nurses, the top five predictors in the BMI change prediction model were unbalanced nutritional diet, poor sleep quality, work-family conflict, lack of exercise, and soft drinks consumption., Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, BMI change was highly prevalent among doctors and nurses in North China. Machine learning models can provide an automated identification mechanism for the prediction of BMI change. Personality traits, dietary behaviors, lifestyles, sleep quality, burnout, and work-related conditions have contributed to the BMI change prediction. Integrated treatment measures should be taken in the management of weight and BMI by policymakers, hospital administrators, and healthcare workers.

   abstract = {The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread throughout China and worldwide since it was reported in Wuhan city, China in December 2019. 4 589 526 confirmed cases have been caused by the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), by May 18, 2020. At the early stage of the pandemic, the large-scale mobility of humans accelerated the spread of the pandemic. Rapidly and accurately tracking the population inflow from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province is especially critical to assess the potential for sustained pandemic transmission in new areas. In this study, we first analyze the impact of related multisource urban data (such as local temperature, relative humidity, air quality, and inflow rate from Hubei province) on daily new confirmed cases at the early stage of the local pandemic transmission. The results show that the early trend of COVID-19 can be explained well by human mobility from Hubei province around the Chinese Lunar New Year. Different from the commonly-used pandemic models based on transmission dynamics, we propose a simple but effective short-term prediction model for COVID-19 cases, considering the human mobility from Hubei province to the target cities. The performance of our proposed model is validated by several major cities in Guangdong province. For cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou with frequent population flow per day, the values of [Formula: see text] of daily prediction achieve 0.988 and 0.985. The proposed model has provided a reference for decision support of pandemic prevention and control in Shenzhen.},

In the simulation results on January 19, 2022, the estimated number of Olympic Games-related infections who were identified at borders was 357 (95%CI: 153-568) and the observed number was 323. The estimated number of "seed" cases that entered the closed-loop of Olympics Games was 195 (95%CI: 43-335), and the observed number of cases in the closed-loop was 212.

This paper aims to forecast future 2 weeks national and state-level COVID-19 new hospital admissions in the United States. Our method is inspired by the strong association between public search behavior and hospitalization admissions and is extended from a previously-proposed influenza tracking model, AutoRegression with GOogle search data (ARGO). Our LASSO-penalized linear regression method efficiently combines Google search information and COVID-19 related time series information with dynamic training and rolling window prediction. Compared to other publicly available models collected from COVID-19 forecast hub, our method achieves substantial error reduction in a retrospective out-of-sample evaluation from Jan 4, 2021, to Dec 27, 2021. Overall, we showed that our method is flexible, self-correcting, robust, accurate, and interpretable, making it a potentially powerful tool to assist healthcare officials and decision making for the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {The aim is to explore the development trend of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) and predict the infectivity of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus), as well as its impact on public health. First, the existing data are analyzed through data pre-processing to extract useful feature factors. Then, the LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) prediction model in the deep learning algorithm is used to predict the epidemic situation in Hubei Province, outside Hubei nationwide, and the whole country, respectively. Meanwhile, the impact of intervention time changes on the epidemic situation is compared. The results show that the prediction results are almost consistent with the actual values. Specifically, Hubei Province abolishes quarantine restrictions after the Spring Festival holiday, and the first COVID-19 peak is reached in late February, while the second COVID-19 peak has been reached in early March. Finally, the cumulative number of diagnoses reaches 85,000 cases, with an increase of 15,000 cases compared with the nationwide cases outside Hubei under the continuous implementation of prevention and control measures. Under the prediction of the proposed LSTM model, if the nationwide implementation of prevention and control interventions is postponed by 5 days, the epidemic will peak in early March, and the cumulative number of diagnoses will be about 200,000; and if the intervention measures are implemented five days earlier, the epidemic will peak in mid-February, with a cumulative number of diagnoses of approximately 40,000. Meanwhile, the proposed LSTM model predicts the RMSE values of the epidemic situation in Hubei Province, outside Hubei nationwide, and the whole country as 34.63, 75.42, and 50.27, respectively. Under model comparison analysis, the prediction error of the proposed LSTM model is small and has better applicability over similar algorithms. The results show that the LSTM model is effective and has high performance in infectious disease prediction, and the research results can provide scientific and effective references for subsequent related research.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is complex and is developing in different ways according to the country involved. METHOD(S): To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. RESULT(S): Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590,000 and 60,000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. CONCLUSION(S): Multiple data sources and cross validation of a COVID-19 epidemic model, coupled with a medical resource logistic model, revealed the key factors that affect epidemic progressions and their outbreak patterns in different countries. These key factors are the type of emergency medical response to avoid runs on medical resources, especially improved detection rates, the ability to promote public health measures, and the synergistic effects of combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs, and staff.},

Many researchers have proposed many epidemiological models to predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19, but all use confirmed cases to predict "onset cases." In this article, a total of 5434 cases were collected from National Health Commission and other provincial Health Commission in China, spanning from 1 December 2019 to 23 February 2020. We studied the delayed distribution of patients from onset to be confirmed. The delay is divided into two stages, which takes about 15 days or even longer. Therefore, considering the right truncation of the data, we proposed a "predict-in-advance" method, used the number of "visiting hospital cases" to predict the number of "onset cases." The results not only show that our prediction shortens the delay of the second stage, but also the predicted value of onset cases is quite close to the real value of onset cases, which can effectively predict the epidemic trend of sudden infectious diseases, and provide an important reference for the government to formulate control measures in advance.},

In this study, we retrieved weekly influenza incidence data and weekly influenza surveillance data from the first week of 2012 through the 48th week of 2018, modelled the data from the National Influenza Centre using an edge intelligence model, and compared them. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the three machine learning techniques based on Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Kalman Filter, and vector autoregression model in predicting influenza incidence and activity patterns. Each technique performs differently under various conditions. The combination of these three techniques can enhance the effectiveness of the forecast, particularly in an outbreak scenario.

   abstract = {The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has threatened the social and economic structure all around the world. Generally, COVID-19 has three possible transmission routes, including pre-symptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, among which the last one has brought a severe challenge for the containment of the disease. One core scientific question is to understand the influence of asymptomatic individuals and of the strength of control measures on the evolution of the disease, particularly on a second outbreak of the disease. To explore these issues, we proposed a novel compartmental model that takes the infection of asymptomatic individuals into account. We get the relationship between asymptomatic individuals and critical strength of control measures theoretically. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of our model and the accuracy of the theoretical analysis by using the real confirmed cases of COVID-19 contamination. Our results, showing the importance of the asymptomatic population on the control measures, would provide useful theoretical reference to the policymakers and fuel future studies of COVID-19.

   abstract = {COVID-19, caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a global pandemic and created unprecedented public health challenges throughout the world. Despite significant progresses in understanding the disease pathogenesis and progression, the epidemiological triad of pathogen, host, and environment remains unclear. In this paper, we develop a multiscale model to study the coupled within-host and between-host dynamics of COVID-19. The model includes multiple transmission routes (both human-to-human and environment-to-human) and connects multiple scales (both the population and individual levels). A detailed analysis on the local and global dynamics of the fast system, slow system and full system shows that rich dynamics, including both forward and backward bifurcations, emerge with the coupling of viral infection and epidemiological models. Model fitting to both virological and epidemiological data facilitates the evaluation of the influence of a few infection characteristics and antiviral treatment on the spread of the disease. Our work underlines the potential role that the environment can play in the transmission of COVID-19. Antiviral treatment of infected individuals can delay but cannot prevent the emergence of disease outbreaks. These results highlight the implementation of comprehensive intervention measures such as social distancing and wearing masks that aim to stop airborne transmission, combined with surface disinfection and hand hygiene that can prevent environmental transmission. The model also provides a multiscale modeling framework to study other infectious diseases when the environment can serve as a reservoir of pathogens.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than 150 million cases of infection to date and poses a serious threat to global public health. In this study, global COVID-19 data were used to examine the dynamical variations from the perspectives of immunity and contact of 84 countries across the five climate regions: tropical, arid, temperate, and cold. A new approach named Yi Hua Jie Mu is proposed to obtain the transmission rates based on the COVID-19 data between the countries with the same climate region over the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will persist over a long period of time or enter into regular circulation in multiple periods of 1-2 years. Moreover, based on the simulated results by the COVID-19 data, it is found that the temperate and cold climate regions have higher infection rates than the tropical and arid climate regions, which indicates that climate may modulate the transmission of COVID-19. The role of the climate on the COVID-19 variations should be concluded with more data and more cautions. The non-pharmaceutical interventions still play the key role in controlling and prevention this global pandemic. Copyright © 2021. The Authors.

   abstract = {Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of acute stress disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health-related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. Results A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean [standard deviation] age = 32.21 [8.77] years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient beta = 0.47, p =.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated, and ASD was associated with hostility. Conclusions During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the well-being of staff in health care systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering that most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

   pages = {100467},
   abstract = {Background: Japan has a concentrated HIV epidemic, with the majority of transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to explore the effect of behavioral and biomedical interventions on the HIV epidemic and forecast the time required to eliminate HIV transmission among Japanese MSM. Method(s): A deterministic compartmental model was built to estimate and forecast the HIV epidemic among Japanese MSM from 2010 to 2050. Elimination of HIV transmission among MSM was defined as incidence less than 1/1000 person-years. The time required for eliminating HIV transmission under different scenarios was calculated. Finding(s): Under the current policies, HIV transmission cannot be eliminated by 2050. Both behavioral and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV among MSM by 2050 with annual number of sexual partners among high-risk MSM less than 9, or with condom use rate above 65%, or with testing and treatment rate above 80%, or with more than 10% PrEP coverage rate. Under comprehensive interventions, HIV elimination will be achieved in 2032, 2025 and 2024 using weak, moderate and strong intervention combinations, respectively. Interpretation(s): Both behavioural and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV among MSM by 2050, but comprehensive interventions can accelerate the realization of this goal with higher feasibility.

   abstract = {In this study, we proposed a new data-driven hybrid technique by integrating an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), with a nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural network (NARANN), called the EEMD-ARIMA-NARANN model, to perform time series modeling and forecasting based on the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality data from 28 February 2020 to 27 June 2020 in South Africa and Nigeria. By comparing the accuracy level of forecasting measurements with the basic ARIMA and NARANN models, it was shown that this novel data-driven hybrid model did a better job of capturing the dynamic changing trends of the target data than the others used in this work. Our proposed mixture technique can be deemed as a helpful policy-supportive tool to plan and provide medical supplies effectively. The overall confirmed cases and deaths were estimated to reach around 176,570 [95% uncertainty level (UL) 173,607 to 178,476] and 3454 (95% UL 3384 to 3487), respectively, in South Africa, along with 32,136 (95% UL 31,568 to 32,641) and 788 (95% UL 775 to 804) in Nigeria on 12 July 2020 using this data-driven EEMD-ARIMA-NARANN hybrid technique. The contributions of this study include three aspects. First, the proposed hybrid model can better capture the dynamic dependency characteristics compared with the individual models. Second, this new data-driven hybrid model is constructed in a more reasonable way relative to the traditional mixture model. Third, this proposed model may be generalized to estimate the epidemic patterns of COVID-19 in other regions.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

   title = {Evaluating the Demand for Nucleic Acid Testing in Different Scenarios of COVID-19 Transmission: A Simulation Study},
   journal = {Infectious Diseases and Therapy},
   abstract = {Introduction: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been recognized as the most severe human infectious disease pandemic in the past century. To enhance our ability to control potential infectious diseases in the future, this study simulated the influence of nucleic acid testing on the transmission of COVID-19 across varied scenarios. Additionally, it assessed the demand for nucleic acid testing under different circumstances, aiming to furnish a decision-making foundation for the implementation of nucleic acid screening measures, the provision of emergency materials, and the allocation of human resources. Method(s): Considering the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and the preventive measures implemented by countries, we explored three distinct levels of epidemic intensity: community transmission, outbreak, and sporadic cases. Integrating the theory of scenario analysis, we formulated six hypothetical epidemic scenarios, each corresponding to possible occurrences during different phases of the pandemic. We developed an improved SEIR model, validated its accuracy using real-world data, and conducted a comprehensive analysis and prediction of COVID-19 infections under these six scenarios. Simultaneously, we assessed the testing resource requirements associated with each scenario. Result(s): We compared the predicted number of infections simulated by the modified SEIR model with the actual reported cases in Israel to validate the model. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 350.09, and the R-squared (R2) was 0.99, indicating a well-fitted model. Scenario 4 demonstrated the most effective prevention and control outcomes. Strengthening non-pharmaceutical interventions and increasing nucleic acid testing frequency, even under low testing capacity, resulted in a delayed epidemic peak by 78 days. The proportion of undetected cases decreased from 77.83% to 31.21%, and the overall testing demand significantly decreased, meeting maximum demand even with low testing capacity. The initiation of testing influenced case detection probability. Under high testing capacity, increasing testing frequency elevated the detection rate from 36.40% to 77.83%. Nucleic acid screening proved effective in reducing the demand for testing resources under diverse epidemic prevention and control strategies. While effective interventions and nucleic acid screening measures substantially diminished the demand for testing-related resources, varying degrees of insufficient testing capacity may still persist. Conclusion(s): The nucleic acid detection strategy proves effective in promptly identifying and isolating infected individuals, thereby mitigating the infection peak and extending the time to peak. In situations with constrained testing capacity, implementing more stringent measures can notably decrease the number of infections and alleviate resource demands. The improved SEIR model demonstrates proficiency in predicting both reported and unreported cases, offering valuable insights for future infection risk assessments. Rapid evaluations of testing requirements across diverse scenarios can aptly address resource limitations in specific regions, offering substantial evidence for the formulation of future infectious disease testing strategies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Objective: To compare the prevalence of anxiety among old people before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, and to provide scientific evidence for psychological intervention of the elderly during public health emergencies. Method(s): In 2019, the National Psychological Care Project for the Elderly was launched, covering 818 communities across the country, and 188 407 subjects received psychological assessment. In April and May 2020, a convenient sample of 6 467 aged 65 and above subjects were followed up on the anxiety status and its influencing factors during the epidemic period by using structurized questionnaire. Data collection and management were carried out using the national elderly psychological care project data collection platform. McNemar test was used to compare the difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly before (October 2019 to January 23, 2020) and during the epidemic (April-May 2020). The difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly with different characteristics was compared by chi square test. The influencing factors of anxiety before and during the epidemic situation were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model. Result(s): The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the elderly population was 4.95% (95%CI: 4.42%-5.48%) before the outbreak of COVID-19, and 10.10% (95%CI: 9.36%-10.83%) during the epidemic which was twice as high as before the outbreak. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors of anxiety symptoms before the outbreak were with one underlying disease (OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.05-2.37), with two or more underlying diseases (OR=3.10, 95%CI: 2.13-4.51), and the protective factors were with hobbies, good relationship between children, good relationship with spouse, positive aging attitude and good psychological resilience (all P<0.05). The risk factors of developing anxiety symptoms during the epidemic were living in rural areas (OR=1.77, 95%CI: 1.42-2.20), participating in social activities regularly (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.48), having a good relationship with friends (OR=1.42, 95%CI: 1.11-1.82) and were quarantined or people around were quarantined for medical observation (OR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.90-4.13). Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 epidemic leads to a double increase in anxiety among the elderly. We should pay more attention to the psychological state of the elderly in rural area and who is being quarantined or people around being quarantined for medical observation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The annual influenza epidemic is a heavy burden on the health care system, and has increasingly become a major public health problem in some areas, such as Hong Kong (China). Therefore, based on a variety of machine learning methods, and considering the seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, the study aims to establish a Combinatorial Judgment Classifier (CJC) model to classify the epidemic trend and improve the accuracy of influenza epidemic early warning. METHOD(S): The characteristic variables were selected using the single-factor statistical method to establish the influencing factor system of an influenza outbreak. On this basis, the CJC model was proposed to provide an early warning for an influenza outbreak. The characteristic variables in the final model included atmospheric pressure, absolute maximum temperature, mean temperature, absolute minimum temperature, mean dew point temperature, the number of positive detections of seasonal influenza viruses, the positive percentage among all respiratory specimens, and the admission rates in public hospitals with a principal diagnosis of influenza. RESULT(S): The accuracy of the CJC model for the influenza outbreak trend reached 96.47%, the sensitivity and specificity change rates of this model were lower than those of other models. Hence, the CJC model has a more stable prediction performance. In the present study, the epidemic situation and meteorological data of Hong Kong in recent years were used as the research objects for the construction of the model index system, and a lag correlation was found between the influencing factors and influenza outbreak. However, some potential risk factors, such as geographical nature and human factors, were not incorporated, which ideally affected the prediction performance to some extent. CONCLUSION(S): In general, the CJC model exhibits a statistically better performance, when compared to some classical early warning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, Discriminant Analysis, and Ensemble Classfiers, which improves the performance of the early warning of seasonal influenza.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic with high morbidity and mortality rates. Current epidemiological studies urge the need of implementing sophisticated methods to appraise the evolution of COVID-19. In this study, we analysed the data for 228 days (1 May to 15 December 2020) of daily incidence of COVID-19 cases for a district level analysis in the region of Jammu and Kashmir in the northern Himalayan belt of India. We used a deep learning-based incremental learning technique to model the current trend of COVID-19 transmission and to predict the future trends with 60-day forecasting. The results not only indicate high rates of morbidity and mortality but also forecast high rise in the incidence of COVID-19 in different districts of the study region. We used geographic information system (GIS) for storing, analysing, and presenting the spread of COVID-19 which provides key insights in understanding, planning, and implementing mitigating measures to tackle the current spread of the pandemic and its possible future scenarios. The existing disparity in health care facilities at district level is shown in relation to the spread of disease. The study results also highlight the need to upgrade health care infrastructure in the study region to control the current and future pandemics. These results could be useful for administration and scientific community to develop efficient short-term and long-term strategies against such diseases.Copyright © 2021.

   journal = {Epidemics},
   volume = {35},
   pages = {100460},
   abstract = {Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza cause a large burden of disease. Evidence of their interaction via temporary cross-protection implies that prevention of one could inadvertently lead to an increase in the burden of the other. However, evidence for the public health impact of such interaction is sparse and largely derives from ecological analyses of peak shifts in surveillance data. To test the robustness of estimates of interaction parameters between RSV and Influenza from surveillance data we conducted a simulation and back-inference study. We developed a two-pathogen interaction model, parameterised to simulate RSV and Influenza epidemiology in the UK. Using the infection model in combination with a surveillance-like stochastic observation process we generated a range of possible RSV and Influenza trajectories and then used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to back-infer parameters including those describing competition. We find that in most scenarios both the strength and duration of RSV and Influenza interaction could be estimated from the simulated surveillance data reasonably well. However, the robustness of inference declined towards the extremes of the plausible parameter ranges, with misleading results. It was for instance not possible to tell the difference between low/moderate interaction and no interaction. In conclusion, our results illustrate that in a plausible parameter range, the strength of RSV and Influenza interaction can be estimated from a single season of high-quality surveillance data but also highlights the importance to test parameter identifiability a priori in such situations.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Predictions of COVID-19 case growth and mortality are critical to the decisions of political leaders, businesses, and individuals grappling with the pandemic. This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.Copyright © 2021 Watson et al.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is transfusion-transmissible. In Australia the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, is established in the north-east, such that local transmission is possible following importation of an index case, which has the potential to impact on blood transfusion safety and public health. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) to model the epidemic potential of ZIKV in Australian locations, compared this with the ecologically similar dengue viruses (DENV), and examined possible implications for blood transfusion safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Varying estimates of vector control efficiency and extrinsic incubation period, "best-case" and "worst-case" scenarios of monthly R0 for ZIKV and DENV were modeled from 1996 to 2015 in 11 areas. We visualized the geographical distribution of blood donors in relation to areas with epidemic potential for ZIKV. RESULT(S): Epidemic potential (R0 > 1) existed for ZIKV and DENV throughout the study period in a number of locations in northern Australia (Cairns, Darwin, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Townsville, and Brisbane) during the warmer months of the year. R0 for DENV was greater than ZIKV and was broadly consistent with annual estimates in Cairns. Increased vector control efficiency markedly reduced the epidemic potential and shortened the season of local transmission. Australian locations that provide the greatest number of blood donors did not have epidemic potential for ZIKV. CONCLUSION(S): We estimate that areas of north-eastern Australia could sustain local transmission of ZIKV. This early contribution to understanding the epidemic potential of ZIKV may assist in the assessment and management of threats to blood transfusion safety.Copyright © 2019 AABB},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic become the major reason of hospitalization of patients in ICU worldwide. AKI is a major disease and continue closely related with sepsis and COVID-19 infection. Cardiac injury is frequent in patients with septic schock and higher levels of cardiac troponin are expected in AKI patients however whether this is related with a poor outcome in the pandemic scenario still remain unknown. The objective of the study was evaluate the impact of the occurrence of AKI and cardiac troponin levels in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and their major outcomes Methods: We conducted an observational study during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 first wave outbreak in Brazil. The research was approved by IRB and patients of a Sao Paulo major public hospital. The main inclusion criteria were the occurrence of COVID-19 infection confirmed by oropharyngeal swab in the last 3 days of admission and the need of permanence of at least 3 days. Patients with a poorer expectancy of survival in the next 24 hours of inclusion were not considered elegible. Blood sample at admission was used to confirm sepsis and AKI and the patients were followed daily untill discharge of the unit or dead. AKI occurrence was seen as the rise of serum creatinine happened according KDIGO AKI guideline. Patients were divided in groups regarding the development of AKI and major outcome (mechanical ventilation or dead) Results: A total of 86 patients with sepsis were included. Female patients represented 58.3% of the sample. About 96,51% of the patients had at admission a level of d-dimer above 500 ng and 77,91% of patients had a cardiac troponin I above 20 ng in AKI patients group with a p level 0f 0,003. About 44 patients had AKI due to COVID-19 sepsis related by admission in the ICU Median serum creatinine at admission was 2.44 mg/dL (1.64-4.02). There was a higher proportion of patients in mechanical ventilation with development of AKI after admission (14) than those without AKI during the whole hospitalization (11) with a p of 0,299 The mortality of patients with higher cardiac troponin were significantly higher in AKI patients than the non AKI patients. Conclusion(s): IIn patients with COVID-19 sepsis related disease, there is a positive correlation between AKI and higher levels of cardiac troponin and higher days with mechanical ventilation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza and other respiratory tract infections are serious public health problems that need to be further addressed and investigated. Internet search data are recognized as a valuable source for forecasting influenza or other respiratory tract infection epidemics. However, the selection of internet search data and the application of forecasting methods are important for improving forecasting accuracy. The aim of the present study was to forecast influenza epidemics based on the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) method, Baidu search index data, and the influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate., METHODS: The official weekly ILI% data for northern and southern mainland China were obtained from the Chinese Influenza Center from 2018 to 2021. Based on the Baidu Index, search indices related to influenza infection over the corresponding time period were obtained. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore the association between influenza-related search queries and the ILI% of southern and northern mainland China. The LSTM model was used to forecast the influenza epidemic within the same week and at lags of 1-4 weeks. The model performance was assessed by evaluation metrics, including the mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)., RESULTS: In total, 24 search queries in northern mainland China and 7 search queries in southern mainland China were found to be correlated and were used to construct the LSTM model, which included the same week and a lag of 1-4 weeks. The LSTM model showed that ILI% + mask with one lag week and ILI% + influenza name were good prediction modules, with reduced RMSE predictions of 16.75% and 4.20%, respectively, compared with the estimated ILI% for northern and southern mainland China., CONCLUSIONS: The results illuminate the feasibility of using an internet search index as a complementary data source for influenza forecasting and the efficiency of using the LSTM model to forecast influenza epidemics.

   abstract = {Objectives: Fitting and forecasting the trend of COVID-19 epidemics. Method(s): Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism, infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February 7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12 were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Result(s): According to the cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the fitting bias of SEIR(+CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%. Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020, respectively. Conclusion(s): The proposed SEIR(+CAQ) dynamic model fits and forecasts the trend of novel coronavirus pneumonia well and provides evidence for decision making.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 20201-4. Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

   abstract = {Understanding the incidence of disease is often crucial for public policy decision-making, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating incidence is challenging, however, when the definition of incidence relies on tests that imperfectly measure disease, as in the case when assays with variable performance are used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To our knowledge, there are no pragmatic methods to address the bias introduced by the performance of labs in testing for the virus. In the setting of a longitudinal study, we developed a maximum likelihood estimation-based approach to estimate laboratory performance-adjusted incidence using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We constructed confidence intervals (CIs) using both bootstrapped-based and large-sample interval estimator approaches. We evaluated our methods through extensive simulation and applied them to a real-world study (TrackCOVID), where the primary goal was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the San Francisco Bay Area from July 2020 to March 2021. Our simulations demonstrated that our method converged rapidly with accurate estimates under a variety of scenarios. Bootstrapped-based CIs were comparable to the large-sample estimator CIs with a reasonable number of incident cases, shown via a simulation scenario based on the real TrackCOVID study. In more extreme simulated scenarios, the coverage of large-sample interval estimation outperformed the bootstrapped-based approach. Results from the application to the TrackCOVID study suggested that assuming perfect laboratory test performance can lead to an inaccurate inference of the incidence. Our flexible, pragmatic method can be extended to a variety of disease and study settings. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

   abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, epidemic models have been central to policy-making. Public health responses have been shaped by model-based projections and inferences, especially related to the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions. Accompanying this has been increased scrutiny over model performance, model assumptions, and the way that uncertainty is incorporated and presented. Here we consider a population-level model, focusing on how distributions representing host infectiousness and the infection-to-death times are modelled, and particularly on the impact of inferred epidemic characteristics if these distributions are mis-specified. We introduce an SIR-type model with the infected population structured by 'infected age', i.e. the number of days since first being infected, a formulation that enables distributions to be incorporated that are consistent with clinical data. We show that inference based on simpler models without infected age, which implicitly mis-specify these distributions, leads to substantial errors in inferred quantities relevant to policy-making, such as the reproduction number and the impact of interventions. We consider uncertainty quantification via a Bayesian approach, implementing this for both synthetic and real data focusing on UK data in the period 15 Feb-14 Jul 2020, and emphasising circumstances where it is misleading to neglect uncertainty.

PURPOSE: Guided by the common-sense model of self-regulation, this observational study examined associations among illness perceptions of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression symptoms among community-dwelling adults. METHOD(S): Data were collected from 1380 adults living in the United States early in the pandemic (03-23-2020 to 06-02-2020). Participants completed online surveys. Analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics and correlations. FINDINGS: While increased anxiety symptoms were associated with less perceived personal control, greater concern, and higher emotional responsiveness, increased depression symptoms were related to lower concern as well as greater emotional responsiveness and perceived consequences of the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Associations among illness perceptions, anxiety, and depression symptoms may impact viral spread mitigation behavior adoption.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Since 2003, 200 cases of bird flu (H5N1) cases have been reported with 168 death (case fatality rate: 84%) in Indonesia. Pandemics are unpredictable, but the threat is imminent. Therefore, pandemic preparedness, which includes full simulation exercises, is a key to reduce this threat. Responding to the challenges, Ministry of Health (MoH) Indonesia adopted WHO pandemic risk management guideline, developed contingency plan and conducted full scale epicenter influenza pandemic simulation. Method(s): The exercise outlines the Government of Indonesia operational plans for Avian Influenza (AI) control from the detection of AI cases (from poultry to human transmission) and containment of human to human transmission of novel influenza virus in influenza pandemic epicenter at Setu village South Tangerang. The simulation covers multiple locations in community, hospitals, point of entry and live bird market. 25 evaluators and around 800 observers involved in the exercise. Result(s): The full scale pandemic epicenter containment exercise has demonstrated Indonesia capacity in whole of society approach pandemic risk management in the overall national emergency response framework, covering command and coordination, animal health response surveillance, medical response, laboratory, risk communication, perimeter control, pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions and civil-military interoperability. It is served as a momentum to improve multisector commitment on pandemic preparedness. The outcome of this exercise has contributed to identification of gaps that require further strengthening of IHR core capacities in the country to reduce the threat of the next influenza pandemic. Conclusion(s): There is also a critical need for more evidence-based strategies and policy formulation to strengthen pandemic preparedness.Copyright © 2020 The Authors},

   abstract = {In response to an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within a cluster of Navy personnel in Sri Lanka commencing from 22nd April 2020, an aggressive outbreak management program was launched by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health. To predict the possible number of cases within the susceptible population under four social distancing scenarios, the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) was used. With increasing social distancing, the epidemiological curve flattened, and its peak shifted to the right. The observed or actually reported number of cases was above the projected number of cases at the onset; however, subsequently, it fell below all predicted trends. Predictive modelling is a useful tool for the control of outbreaks such as COVID-19 in a closed community.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Thailand was the first country reporting the first Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individual outside mainland China. Here we delineated the course of the COVID-19 outbreak together with the timeline of the control measures and public health policies employed by the Thai government during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand. Based on the comprehensive epidemiological data, we reconstructed the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission in Thailand using a stochastic modeling approach. Our stochastic model incorporated the effects of individual heterogeneity in infectiousness on disease transmission, which allows us to capture relevant features of superspreading events. We found that our model could accurately capture the transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in Thailand. The model predicted that at the end of the first wave, the number of cumulative confirmed cases was 3091 (95%CI: 2782-3400). We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) during the first epidemic wave. We found that after implementing the nationwide interventions, the Rt in Thailand decreased from the peak value of 5.67 to a value below one in less than one month, indicating that the control measures employed by the Thai government during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave were effective. Finally, the effects of transmission heterogeneity and control measures on the likelihood of outbreak extinction were also investigated.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the current early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Bali needs to prepare to face the escalation of cases, with a particular focus on the readiness of healthcare services. We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity., METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios., RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446., CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare system in Bali is in danger of collapse; thus, serious efforts are needed to improve COVID-19 interventions and to prepare the healthcare system in Bali to the greatest extent possible.},

   abstract = {Exposure to stressful life events involving threat and uncertainty often results in the development of anxiety. However, the factors that confer risk and resilience for anxiety following real world stress at a computational level remain unclear. We identified core components of uncertainty aversion moderating response to stress posed by the COVID-19 pandemic derived from computational modeling of decision making. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we investigated both immediate effects at the onset of the stressor, as well as medium-term changes in response to persistent stress. 479 subjects based in the United States completed a decision-making task measuring risk aversion, loss aversion, and ambiguity aversion in the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020). Self-report measures targeting threat perception, anxiety, and avoidant behavior in response to the pandemic were collected at the same time point and 8 weeks later (May 2020). Cross-sectional analyses indicated that higher risk aversion predicted higher perceived threat from the pandemic, and ambiguity aversion for guaranteed gains predicted perceived threat and pandemic-related anxiety. In longitudinal analyses, ambiguity aversion for guaranteed gains predicted greater increases in perceived infection likelihood. Together, these results suggest that individuals who have a low-level aversion toward uncertainty show stronger negative emotional reactions to both the onset and persistence of real-life stressCopyright © 2022 American Psychological Association},

   abstract = {The dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly changed since its initial outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy in the specific context of Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 415 patients with cancer. Instruments used were a demographic and clinical characteristics form, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (cancer symptom burden), Strategies Used by People to Promote Health (self-care self-efficacy), and a Thai version of the Brief Form of the WHO Quality of Life Assessment. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The participants had an average age of 56 years. They reported a moderate level of QoL across all domains and for the overall QoL during the pandemic. The results of the multiple linear regression model indicated that positive self-care self-efficacy, being married, having health insurance, stage of chemotherapy, and reduced cancer symptom burden were significant predictors of overall QoL (adjusted R2 = 0.4940). Positive self-care self-efficacy also emerged as a primary predictor, positively influencing all QoL domains and overall QoL (p < 0.001). These findings emphasize the significance of self-care self-efficacy in enhancing the QoL of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy during the pandemic. Integrating interventions to bolster self-care self-efficacy into the care plans for these patients can help them manage their symptoms, cope with the side effects of cancer treatment, and enhance their overall well-being.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly and this scenario is concerning in South America, mainly in Brazil that presented more than 21 million coronavirus disease 2019 cases and 590 000 deaths. The recent emergence of novel lineages carrying several mutations in the spike protein has raised additional public health concerns worldwide. The present study describes the temporal spreading and evolution of SARS-CoV2 in the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Brazil, highlighting the fast dissemination of the two major concerning variants (P.1 and P.2). A total of 2507 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences (WGSs) with available information from the country (Brazil) and sampling date (July 2020-February 2021), were obtained and the frequencies of the lineages were evaluated in the period of the growing second pandemic wave. The results demonstrated the increasing prevalence of P.1 and P.2 lineages in the period evaluated. P.2 lineage was first detected in the middle of 2020, but a high increase occurred only in the last trimester of this same year and the spreading to all Brazilian regions. P.1 lineage emerged even later, first in the North region in December 2020 and really fast dissemination to all other Brazilian regions in January and February 2021. All SARS-CoV-2 WGSs of P.1 and P.2 were further separately evaluated with a Bayesian approach. The rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were statistically higher in P.1 than P.2 (p < 0.01). The phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that P.2 gradually spread in all the country from September 2020 to January 2021, while P.1 disseminated even faster from December 2020 to February 2021. Skyline plots of both lineages demonstrated a slight rise in the spreading for P.2 and exponential growth for P.1. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that the P.1 (recently renamed as Gamma) and P.2 lineages have predominated in the second pandemic wave due to the very high spreading across all geographic regions in Brazil at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

Among other things, we illustrate the use of a probabilistic programming language that automates inference in existing simulators. Neither the full capabilities of this tool for automating inference nor its utility for planning is widely disseminated at the current time. Timely gains in understanding about how such simulation-based models and inference automation tools applied in support of policy-making could lead to less economically damaging policy prescriptions, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Under varying scenarios for hospital capacity, we found that the population needing care would overwhelm the system's ability to provide care in the case study. Our model is presented as a framework that can be augmented and expanded to suit the needs of the particular event and healthcare system or services required. By integrating concepts and models from epidemiology, geography, and health care services research, we provide a valuable tool for potential use in disaster planning, hospital system evaluation, and pandemic preparedness.Copyright © 2019},

   abstract = {Prediction of the progression of an infectious disease outbreak is important for planning and coordinating a response. Differential equations are often used to model an epidemic outbreak's behaviour but are challenging to parameterise. Furthermore, these models can suffer from misspecification, which biases predictions and parameter estimates. Stochastic models can help with misspecification but are even more expensive to simulate and perform inference with. Here, we develop an explicitly likelihood-based variation of the generalised profiling method as a tool for prediction and inference under model misspecification. Our approach allows us to carry out identifiability analysis and uncertainty quantification using profile likelihood-based methods without the need for marginalisation. We provide justification for this approach by introducing a new interpretation of the model approximation component as a stochastic constraint. This preserves the rationale for using profiling rather than integration to remove nuisance parameters while also providing a link back to stochastic models. We applied an initial version of this method during an outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019-2020 and found that it achieved relatively fast, accurate predictions. Here we present the most recent version of our method and its application to this measles outbreak, along with additional validation.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {The unprecedented global crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked numerous efforts to create predictive models for the detection and prognostication of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the goal of helping health systems allocate resources. Machine learning models, in particular, hold promise for their ability to leverage patient clinical information and medical images for prediction. However, most of the published COVID-19 prediction models thus far have little clinical utility due to methodological flaws and lack of appropriate validation. In this paper, we describe our methodology to develop and validate multi-modal models for COVID-19 mortality prediction using multi-center patient data. The models for COVID-19 mortality prediction were developed using retrospective data from Madrid, Spain (N=2547) and were externally validated in patient cohorts from a community hospital in New Jersey, USA (N=242) and an academic center in Seoul, Republic of Korea (N=336). The models we developed performed differently across various clinical settings, underscoring the need for a guided strategy when employing machine learning for clinical decision-making. We demonstrated that using features from both the structured electronic health records and chest X-ray imaging data resulted in better 30-day mortality prediction performance across all three datasets (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.87), 0.76 (0.70-0.82), and 0.95 (0.92-0.98)). We discuss the rationale for the decisions made at every step in developing the models and have made our code available to the research community. We employed the best machine learning practices for clinical model development. Our goal is to create a toolkit that would assist investigators and organizations in building multi-modal models for prediction, classification, and/or optimization.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Hospitals are the focus of the fight against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To meet this challenge hospitals need a Disaster Response Plan and a Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) as a crisis leadership tool. The complex dependency between the systems staff, supplies, and space during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major problem for hospitals. To take the appropriate countermeasures, the effects of the crisis on these systems must be detected, analyzed, and displayed. The presentation and interpretation of such complex processes often poses serious problems for the hospitals' incident commanders. In this article, we describe a new model that is able to display these complex interrelationships within the command process. The model was developed and deployed during the disaster response to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to facilitate the entire command process and to improve hospital disaster response. The approach of the model is as simple as it is innovative. It perfectly symbolizes the basic principle of disaster medicine: keep is safe and simple. It will help hospitals to improve command and control and to optimize the disaster response during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.},

   abstract = {The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international concern. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in human feces and to a less extent in urine, and in raw wastewaters (to date viral RNA only) suggesting that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The ability to mitigate the damages caused by emergencies is an important symbol of the modernization of an emergency capability. When responding to emergencies, government agencies and decision makers need more information sources to estimate the possible evolution of the disaster in a more efficient manner. In this paper, an optimization model for predicting the dynamic evolution of COVID-19 is presented by combining the propagation algorithm of system dynamics with the warning indicators. By adding new parameters and taking the country as the research object, the epidemic situation in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom was simulated and predicted, the impact of prevention and control measures such as effective contact coefficient on the epidemic situation was analyzed, and the effective contact coefficient of the country was analyzed. The paper strives to provide early warning of emergencies scientifically and effectively through the combination of these two technologies, and put forward feasible references for the implementation of various countermeasures. Judging from the conclusion, this study reaffirmed the importance of responding quickly to public health emergencies and formulating prevention and control policies to reduce population exposure and prevent the spread of the pandemic.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate the regional and age-specific distribution of AIDS/HIV in China from 2004 to 2017 and to conduct time series analysis of the epidemiological trends. METHOD(S): Using official surveillance data from publicly accessible database of the national infectious disease reporting system, we described long-term patterns of incidence and death in AIDS/HIV, analyzed age group and regional epidemic characteristics, and established Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for time series analysis. RESULT(S): The incidence and death of AIDS/HIV have increased rapidly from 2004 to 2017, with significant difference regarding age groups and provincial regions (a few provinces appear as hot spots). With goodness-of-fit criteria and using data from 2004 to 2015, ARIMA (0,1,3)x(2,0,0), ARIMA (3,1,0)x(1,0,1), and ARIMA (0,1,2)x(2,0,0) were chosen as the optimal model for the incidence of AIDS, HIV, and combined; ARIMA (0,1,3)x(1,0,0) was chosen as the optimal model for the death of AIDS, HIV, and combined. ARIMA models robustly predicted the incidence and death of AIDS/HIV in 2016 and 2017. CONCLUSION(S): A focused intervention strategy targeting specific regions and age groups is essential for the prevention and control of AIDS/HIV. ARIMA models function as data-driven and evidence-based methods to forecast the trends of infectious diseases and formulate public health policies.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a life-threatening pandemic. The epidemic trends in different countries vary considerably due to different policy-making and resources mobilization. We calculated basic reproduction number (R0) and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 by using the maximum likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively. European and North American countries possessed higher R0 and unsteady Rt fluctuations, whereas some heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R0 and declining Rt now. The numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge outbreaks cannot be ignored. Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model. First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt. Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation. Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life. Our mathematical modeling provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment and mitigation policies for COVID-19.},

   abstract = {The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic leading to over 180 million confirmed cases and nearly 4 million deaths until June 2021, according to the World Health Organization. Since the initial report in December 2019 , COVID-19 has demonstrated a high transmission rate (with an R0 > 2), a diverse set of clinical characteristics (e.g., high rate of hospital and intensive care unit admission rates, multi-organ dysfunction for critically ill patients due to hyperinflammation, thrombosis, etc.), and a tremendous burden on health care systems around the world. To understand the serious and complex diseases and develop effective control, treatment, and prevention strategies, researchers from different disciplines have been making significant efforts from different aspects including epidemiology and public health, biology and genomic medicine, as well as clinical care and patient management. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced into the healthcare field to aid clinical decision-making for disease diagnosis and treatment such as detecting cancer based on medical images, and has achieved superior performance in multiple data-rich application scenarios. In the COVID-19 pandemic, AI techniques have also been used as a powerful tool to overcome the complex diseases. In this context, the goal of this study is to review existing studies on applications of AI techniques in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, these efforts can be grouped into the fields of epidemiology, therapeutics, clinical research, social and behavioral studies and are summarized. Potential challenges, directions, and open questions are discussed accordingly, which may provide new insights into addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and would be helpful for researchers to explore more related topics in the post-pandemic era.

   pages = {479-487},
   abstract = {Japan has the highest proportion of older adults worldwide but has fewer critical care beds than most high-income countries. Although the COVID-19 infection rate in Japan is low compared with Europe and the United States, by the end of 2020, several infected people died in ambulances because they could not find hospitals to accept them. Our study aimed to examine the Japanese healthcare system's capacity to accommodate critically ill COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. We created a model to estimate bed and staff capacity at 3 levels of pandemic response (conventional, contingency, and crisis), as defined by the US National Academy of Medicine, and the function of Japan's healthcare system at each level. We then compared our estimates of the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care at peak times with the national health system capacity using expert panel data. Our findings suggest that Japan's healthcare system currently can accommodate only a limited number of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It could accommodate the surge of pandemic demands by converting nonintensive care unit beds to critical care beds and using nonintensive care unit staff for critical care. However, bed and staff capacity should not be expanded uniformly, so that the limited number of physicians and nurses are allocated efficiently and so staffing does not become the bottleneck of the expansion. Training and deploying physicians and nurses to provide immediate intensive care is essential. The key is to introduce and implement the concept and mechanism of tiered staffing in the Japanese healthcare system. More importantly, most intensive care facilities in Japanese hospitals are small-scaled and thinly distributed in each region. The government needs to introduce an efficient system for smooth dispatching of medical personnel among hospitals regardless of their founding institutions.},

Using a quantitative method (i.e., cross-sectional survey), data was collected from 325 respondents via a structured questionnaire and subsequently analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through AMOS software. The findings of the study revealed that convenience and food quality generate utilitarian values, while subjective norms and novelty-seeking form hedonic values. Also, utilitarian and hedonic values significantly affect cognitive and affective attitudes. As opposed to food quality, the cognitive attitude, affective attitude, self-identity, and subjective norms were observed to affect behavioral intention, with affective attitude producing the strongest association, albeit with the high explanatory power of the model. Consequently, this study offers a number of theoretical and policy implications to design better interventions that address public health regarding fast food consumption.

The study is based on a vSIADR model which allows asymptomatic and pre-diagnosis infections to reflect COVID-19 clinical realities, and a linear mixed-effect model to analyse the association between each country's control measures and the effective reproduction number R t . It finds significant effects of higher stringency measures in lowering the reproduction, and a significant shortening effect on the time to the epidemic turning point by applying stronger early counter measures. Epidemic projections under scenarios of the counter measures (China and Korea, the USA and the UK) show substantial reduction in the epidemic size and death by taking earlier and forceful actions. The governments' response before and after the start of the second wave epidemics were alarmingly weak, which made the average duration of the second wave more than doubled that of the first wave. We identify countries which urgently need to restore to at least the maximum stringency measures implemented so far in the pandemic in order to avoid even higher infection size and death.

We then calculated the predictive incidence of each STD in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by the established Model. And we estimated the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiological changes of STDs by analyzing the difference between the absolute percentage error (APE) of the predictive incidence and actual rate in 2019 and 2020. Result(s): The incidence of HIV infection and syphilis showed a trend of increase from 2008 to 2019 in China, but that for gonorrhea was fluctuant. Of note, the incidence of these three STDs decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The APE of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in 2020 (20.54%, 15.45% and 60.88%) were about 7 times, 4 times and 2 times of that in 2019 (2.94%, 4.07% and 30.41%). The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea would be 5.77/100,000, 39.64/100,000 and 13.19/100,000 in 2021 based on our model. Conclusion(s): The epidemiological trend of STDs in China was significant influenced by COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to balance the control of COVID-19 and timely management of STDs during the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent or reduce the poor outcome among COVID-19 patients with STDs. New management strategies on STDs, such as leveraging social media, online medical care, rapid self-testing, timely diagnosis and treatment guarantee and balance of medical resources for STDs management should be adapted in the context of the long-term effects of COVID-19.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19, which emerged in December 2019, has spread rapidly around the world and has become a serious public health event endangering human life. With regard to COVID-19, there are still many unknowns, such as the exact case fatality rate (CFR). OBJECTIVE(S): The main objective of this study was to explore the value of the discharged CFR (DCFR) to make more accurate forecasts of epidemic trends of COVID-19 in Italy. METHOD(S): We retrieved the epidemiological data of COVID-19 in Italy published by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. We then used the proportion of deaths to discharged cases(including deaths and recovered cases) to calculate the total DCFR (tDCFR), monthly DCFR (mDCFR), and stage DCFR (sDCFR). Furthermore, we analyzed the trend in the mDCFR between January and December 2020 using joinpoint regression analysis, used ArcGIS version 10.7 to visualize the spatial distribution of the epidemic CFR, and assigned different colors to each province based on the CFR or tDCFR. RESULT(S): We calculated the numbers and obtained the new indices of the tDCFR and mDCFR for calculating the fatality rate. The results showed that the tDCFR and mDCFR fluctuated greatly from January to May. They first showed a rapid increase followed by a rapid decline after reaching the peak. The map showed that the provinces with a high tDCFR were Emilia-Romagna, Puglia, and Lombardia. The change trend of the mDCFR over time was divided into the following 2 stages: the first stage (from January to May) and the second stage (from June to December). With regard to worldwide COVID-19 statistics, among 6 selected countries, the United States had the highest tDCFR (4.26%), while the tDCFR of the remaining countries was between 0.98% and 2.72%. CONCLUSION(S): We provide a new perspective for assessing the fatality of COVID-19 in Italy, which can use ever-changing data to calculate a more accurate CFR and scientifically predict the development trend of the epidemic.Copyright ©Mengqing Yan, Wenjun Kang, Zhifeng Guo, Qi Wang, Peizhong Peter Wang, Yun Zhu, Yongli Yang, Wei Wang.

   abstract = {Importance: Machine learning could be used to predict the likelihood of diagnosis and severity of illness. Lack of COVID-19 patient data has hindered the data science community in developing models to aid in the response to the pandemic., Objectives: To describe the rapid development and evaluation of clinical algorithms to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization using patient data by citizen scientists, provide an unbiased assessment of model performance, and benchmark model performance on subgroups., Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic and prognostic study operated a continuous, crowdsourced challenge using a model-to-data approach to securely enable the use of regularly updated COVID-19 patient data from the University of Washington by participants from May 6 to December 23, 2020. A postchallenge analysis was conducted from December 24, 2020, to April 7, 2021, to assess the generalizability of models on the cumulative data set as well as subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, and time of COVID-19 test. By December 23, 2020, this challenge engaged 482 participants from 90 teams and 7 countries., Main Outcomes and Measures: Machine learning algorithms used patient data and output a score that represented the probability of patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test result or being hospitalized within 21 days after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result. Algorithms were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) scores. Ensemble models aggregating models from the top challenge teams were developed and evaluated., Results: In the analysis using the cumulative data set, the best performance for COVID-19 diagnosis prediction was an AUROC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.775-0.777) and an AUPRC of 0.297, and for hospitalization prediction, an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.794-0.798) and an AUPRC of 0.188. Analysis on top models submitting to the challenge showed consistently better model performance on the female group than the male group. Among all age groups, the best performance was obtained for the 25- to 49-year age group, and the worst performance was obtained for the group aged 17 years or younger., Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic and prognostic study, models submitted by citizen scientists achieved high performance for the prediction of COVID-19 testing and hospitalization outcomes. Evaluation of challenge models on demographic subgroups and prospective data revealed performance discrepancies, providing insights into the potential bias and limitations in the models.},

   abstract = {The new type of coronavirus pneumonia is caused by the new type of coronavirus which appeared at the end of 2019. Because of its strong contagiousness, rapid spread and great harm, it has already given countries around the world serious effects. So far there is no clear specific drug. Scientifically grasping the development law of epidemics is extremely important for preventing and controlling epidemics. Since the latent of this epidemic are also highly contagious, traditional infectious disease models cannot accurately describe the regularity of this epidemic transmission. Based on the traditional infectious disease model, an infectious disease model with a time delay is proposed. The time difference is used to characterize the cycle of viral infection and treatment time. Using the epidemic data released in real time, firstly, through the numerical simulation parameter inversion, the minimum error is obtained; then we simulate the development trend of the epidemic according to the dynamics system; finally, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of isolation measures. This article has simulated COVID-19 and analyzed the development of the epidemic in Beijing and Wuhan. By comparing the severity of the epidemic in the two regions, early detection and isolation are still the top priority of epidemic prevention and control.},

   abstract = {The influenza pandemic is a wide-ranging threat to people's health and property all over the world. Developing effective strategies for predicting the influenza outbreak which may prevent or at least get ready for a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Owing to the complexity of influenza outbreaks that are usually involved with spatial and temporal characteristics of both biological and social systems, however, it is a challenging task to achieve the real-time monitoring of influenza outbreaks. In this study, by exploring the rich dynamical information of the city network during influenza outbreaks, we developed a computational method, the minimum-spanning-tree-based dynamical network marker (MST-DNM), to identify the tipping point or critical stage prior to the influenza outbreak. With historical records of influenza outpatients between 2009 and 2018, the MST-DNM strategy has been validated by accurate predictions of the influenza outbreaks in three Japanese cities/regions, respectively, i.e., Tokyo, Osaka, and Hokkaido. These successful applications show that the early-warning signal was detected 4 weeks on average ahead of each influenza outbreak. The results show that our method is of considerable potential in the practice of public health surveillance.Copyright © 2020 Kun Yang et al.},

   abstract = {Background: Influenza outbreaks pose a significant threat to global public health. Traditional surveillance systems and simple algorithms often struggle to predict influenza outbreaks in an accurate and timely manner. Big data and modern technology have offered new modalities for disease surveillance and prediction. Influenza-like illness can serve as a valuable surveillance tool for emerging respiratory infectious diseases like influenza and COVID-19, especially when reported case data may not fully reflect the actual epidemic curve. Objective(s): This study aimed to develop a predictive model for influenza outbreaks by combining Baidu search query data with traditional virological surveillance data. The goal was to improve early detection and preparedness for influenza outbreaks in both northern and southern China, providing evidence for supplementing modern intelligence epidemic surveillance methods. Method(s): We collected virological data from the National Influenza Surveillance Network and Baidu search query data from January 2011 to July 2018, totaling 3,691,865 and 1,563,361 respective samples. Relevant search terms related to influenza were identified and analyzed for their correlation with influenza-positive rates using Pearson correlation analysis. A distributed lag nonlinear model was used to assess the lag correlation of the search terms with influenza activity. Subsequently, a predictive model based on the gated recurrent unit and multiple attention mechanisms was developed to forecast the influenza-positive trend. Result(s): This study revealed a high correlation between specific Baidu search terms and influenza-positive rates in both northern and southern China, except for 1 term. The search terms were categorized into 4 groups: essential facts on influenza, influenza symptoms, influenza treatment and medicine, and influenza prevention, all of which showed correlation with the influenza-positive rate. The influenza prevention and influenza symptom groups had a lag correlation of 1.4-3.2 and 5.0-8.0 days, respectively. The Baidu search terms could help predict the influenza-positive rate 14-22 days in advance in southern China but interfered with influenza surveillance in northern China. Conclusion(s): Complementing traditional disease surveillance systems with information from web-based data sources can aid in detecting warning signs of influenza outbreaks earlier. However, supplementation of modern surveillance with search engine information should be approached cautiously. This approach provides valuable insights for digital epidemiology and has the potential for broader application in respiratory infectious disease surveillance. Further research should explore the optimization and customization of search terms for different regions and languages to improve the accuracy of influenza prediction models.Copyright ©Liuyang Yang, Ting Zhang, Xuan Han, Jiao Yang, Yanxia Sun, Libing Ma, Jialong Chen, Yanming Li, Shengjie Lai, Wei Li, Luzhao Feng, Weizhong Yang.},

   volume = {21},

   pages = {203-212},
   abstract = {Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. Method(s): In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and >=75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). Finding(s): During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1.39% (95% credible interval 1.04-1.77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and >=75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0.116% (0.0729-0.148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0.939% (0.729-1.19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4.87% (3.37-6.89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14.2% (10.2-18.1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6.72% (5.52-8.01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19.1% (14.7-21.9) for those aged 75 years and older. Interpretation(s): Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will likely remain a major public health burden; accurate forecast of COVID-19 epidemic outcomes several months into the future is needed to support more proactive planning. Here, we propose strategies to address three major forecast challenges, i.e., error growth, the emergence of new variants, and infection seasonality. Using these strategies in combination we generate retrospective predictions of COVID-19 cases and deaths 6 months in the future for 10 representative US states. Tallied over >25,000 retrospective predictions through September 2022, the forecast approach using all three strategies consistently outperformed a baseline forecast approach without these strategies across different variant waves and locations, for all forecast targets. Overall, probabilistic forecast accuracy improved by 64% and 38% and point prediction accuracy by 133% and 87% for cases and deaths, respectively. Real-time 6-month lead predictions made in early October 2022 suggested large attack rates in most states but a lower burden of deaths than previous waves during October 2022 -March 2023; these predictions are in general accurate compared to reported data. The superior skill of the forecast methods developed here demonstrate means for generating more accurate long-lead forecast of COVID-19 and possibly other infectious diseases.Copyright: © 2023 Yang, Shaman.},

   abstract = {This research was aimed at exploring the construction and evaluation method of the comprehensive emergency response system for public health emergencies under the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) epidemic situation based on discrete stochastic mathematical model. The response of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of Taiyuan city in the COVID-19 epidemic situation was taken as an example. A new discrete stochastic COVID-19 epidemic spread mathematical model which integrated public health intervention and input cases was proposed. The model was parameterized by multisource data, and the impact of different flow patterns on the risk of secondary outbreak was analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of its emergency system construction were analyzed. Additionally, the improvement measures and suggestions for the existing problems were proposed. Results suggested that there was only one specialized disease prevention and control institution in Taiyuan, and there were only 11 centers for disease prevention and control, accounting for 6.2% (11/177) of the total in Shanxi Province. Through the analysis, it was found that the current public health emergency response system in Taiyuan city had imperfect management coordination mechanism, incomplete plan type, serious shortage of public health personnel, poor information communication efficiency, insufficient early warning efficiency of the epidemic detection system, and weak logistics material security links. Therefore, it was proposed to establish a sound coordination system of emergency health management and vigorously promote the construction of emergency health management institutions. Thus, a public health emergency management system integrating management coordination system, plan system, emergency team building system, material reserve management, and other functions was formed. The application of discrete stochastic mathematical model suggests that intermittent population flow and effective isolation of infected people in transient population can effectively reduce the risk of secondary outbreak. The system analysis here also provides theoretical basis for improving the construction of public health emergency response system in Taiyuan.Copyright © 2022 Ying Yang et al.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread stealthily and presented a tremendous threat to the public. It is important to investigate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and the economy. In this article, we develop a new epidemic model that utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. The model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well as the lag between symptom onset and the confirmation date of infection. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model. Using the daily reported number of confirmed cases, we describe an estimation procedure for the model parameters, which involves adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm. To illustrate the use of the proposed model, we examine the COVID-19 data from Quebec for the period from 2 April 2020 to 10 May 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model under a variety of settings. Copyright © 2022 Statistical Society of Canada.},

   abstract = {Objectives This study aims to explore the mediating effect and influence mechanism of organisational commitment on the association among thriving at work and job satisfaction among frontline primary public health workers (PHWs) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design This study is a cross-sectional written survey. Setting We included 20 primary care units in northern provinces of China. Participants A total of 601 PHWs who worked in primary organisations and against COVID-19 on the front line were included. Methods We collected the data from the participants' written questionnaire (Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, thriving at work scale and organisational commitment scale), and programmed AMOS V.26.0 to develop a structural equation model (SEM) based on the relationships among the three variables. Results The thriving at work scores of the primary PHWs were (M=3.17, SD=0.65), and job satisfaction was (M=3.05, SD=0.69); the scores of their thriving at work, organisational commitment and job satisfaction were all significantly correlated (p<0.01); and the SEM indicated that organisational commitment had a significant partial mediating effect between thriving at work and job satisfaction. The overall effect value was 0.867, and the mediated effect value was 0.422, accounting for 48.7% of the total effect size. Conclusion The thriving at work and job satisfaction scores of primary PHWs in China are moderate, and thriving at work not only affects job satisfaction directly, but also indirectly through organisational commitment. This study suggests that health policy-makers should promote job satisfaction among PHWs through relative inventions aiming to improve their thriving at work and organisational commitment.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

   abstract = {The emergence of epidemics has seriously threatened the running of human society, such as COVID-19. During the epidemics, some external factors usually have a non-negligible impact on the epidemic transmission. Therefore, we not only consider the interaction between epidemic-related information and infectious diseases, but also the influence of policy interventions on epidemic propagation in this work. We establish a novel model that includes two dynamic processes to explore the co-evolutionary spread of epidemic-related information and infectious diseases under policy intervention, one of which depicts information diffusion about infectious diseases and the other denotes the epidemic transmission. A weighted network is introduced into the epidemic spreading to characterize the impact of policy interventions on social distance between individuals. The dynamic equations are established to describe the proposed model according to the micro-Markov chain (MMC) method. The derived analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold indicate that the network topology, epidemic-related information diffusion and policy intervention all have a direct impact on the epidemic threshold. We use numerical simulation experiments to verify the dynamic equations and epidemic threshold, and further discuss the co-evolution dynamics of the proposed model. Our results show that strengthening epidemic-related information diffusion and policy intervention can significantly inhibit the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases. The current work can provide some valuable references for public health departments to formulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.

   abstract = {At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began to emerge on a global scale, including China, and left deep traces on all societies. The spread of this virus shows remarkable temporal and spatial characteristics. Therefore, analyzing and visualizing the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are relevant to the current pressing need and have realistic significance. In this article, we constructed a new model based on time-geography to analyze the movement pattern of COVID-19 in Hebei Province. The results show that as time changed COVID-19 presented an obvious dynamic distribution in space. It gradually migrated from the southwest region of Hebei Province to the northeast region. The factors affecting the moving patterns may be the migration and flow of population between and within the province, the economic development level and the development of road traffic of each city. It can be divided into three stages in terms of time. The first stage is the gradual spread of the epidemic, the second is the full spread of the epidemic, and the third is the time and again of the epidemic. Finally, we can verify the accuracy of the model through the stand-ard deviation ellipse and location entropy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Combined with robust analytic systems and tools available for investigators, VA Research has produced actionable results during the COVID-19 pandemic. Big data science techniques applied to VA's health care data demonstrate that medical research can be performed quickly and judiciously during nationwide health care emergencies., Observations: We envision a common framework of data collection, management, and surveillance implemented in partnership with other health care agencies that would capture even broader, actionable, and timely observational data on populations, while providing opportunities for enhanced collaborative research across agencies. This model should be continued and expanded through the current COVID-19 and future pandemics., Conclusions: Extending the achievements of VA Research in the COVID-19 pandemic to date, we advocate national goals of open science by working toward a synergistic national framework of anonymized, synchronized, shared health data that would provide researchers with potent tools to combat future public health crises.

   number = {2},
   pages = {1149-1167},
   abstract = {At present, more and more countries have entered the parallel stage of fighting the epidemic and restoring the economy after reaching the inflection point. Due to economic pressure, the government of India had to implement a policy of relaxing control during the rising period of the epidemic. This paper proposes a compartment model to study the development of COVID-19 in India after relaxing control. The Sigmoid function reflecting the cumulative effect is used to characterize the model-based diagnosis rate, cure rate and mortality rate. Considering the influence of the lockdown on the model parameters, the data are fitted using the method of least squares before and after the lockdown. According to numerical simulation and model analysis, the impact of India's relaxation of control before and after the inflection point is studied. Research shows that adopting a relaxation policy prematurely will have disastrous consequences. Even if the degree of relaxation is only 5% before the inflection point, it will increase the number of deaths by 15.03%. If the control is relaxed after the inflection point, the higher degree of relaxation, the more likely a secondary outbreak will occur, which will extend the duration of the pandemic, leading to more deaths and put more pressure on the health care system. It is found that after the implementation of the relaxation policy, medical quarantine capability and public cooperation are two vital indicators. The results show that if the supply of kits and detection speed can be increased after the control is relaxed, the secondary outbreak can be effectively avoided. Meanwhile, the increase in public cooperation can significantly reduce the spread of the virus, suppress the second outbreak of the pandemic and reduce the death toll. It is of reference significance to the government's policy formulation. Copyright © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.},

   abstract = {This study explores the use of numerical simulations to model the spread of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using fractional-order COVID-19 models and Haar wavelet collocation methods. The fractional order COVID-19 model considers various factors that affect the virus's transmission, and the Haar wavelet collocation method offers a precise and efficient solution to the fractional derivatives used in the model. The simulation results yield crucial insights into the Omicron variant's spread, providing valuable information to public health policies and strategies designed to mitigate its impact. This study marks a significant advancement in comprehending the COVID-19 pandemic's dynamics and the emergence of its variants. The COVID-19 epidemic model is reworked utilizing fractional derivatives in the Caputo sense, and the model's existence and uniqueness are established by considering fixed point theory results. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model to identify the parameter with the highest sensitivity. For numerical treatment and simulations, we apply the Haar wavelet collocation method.

   abstract = {Purpose: To analyse structural and non-structural modifications of acute stroke care pathways undertaken at healthcare institutions across the regions of Italy due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method(s): Research on National decrees specific for the pandemic was carried out. The stroke pathways of four Italian regions from North to South, such as Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio and Campania, were analysed before and after the pandemic outbreak. Finding(s): On 29 February 2020, the Italian Minister of Health issued national guidelines on how to address the COVID-19 emergency. Stroke management was affected and required changes, basically resulting in the need to prioritise the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. In the most affected regions, the closure of departments and hospitals led to a complete reorganisation of previously functioning stroke networks. With the closure of several Stroke Units and Stroke Centres, the transportation time to hospital lengthened significantly, especially for the outlying populations. Discussion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been spreading rapidly in Italy and placing an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. In response to this, political and healthcare decision-makers worked together to develop and implement efforts to sustain the national healthcare system while fighting the pandemic. Stroke care pathways changed during the pandemic and different organisational models were applied in the most affected regions. Conclusion(s): Stroke treatment pathways will need to be redesigned so to guarantee that severe and acute disease patients do not lose their rights to the access and delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemics.Copyright © European Stroke Organisation 2020.},

   abstract = {Background: More than 360,000 people infected with COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) by the end of May 2020.The spatial variations of prevalence across the counties in NYS suggested that variations in county-level factors might contribute to the statewide COVID-19 outbreak. However, no study to date investigates such variations and the relevant predictors. We leveraged multiple public datasets and machine learning approaches to construct the county-level spatial-temporal prediction model of COVID-19 in NYS. Findings generating from this study help identify counties with high prevalence, county-level predictors, and promising next steps for policy efforts to control the second wave of statewide COVID-19 transmission. Method(s): Cumulative confirmed case rates (CCCR) of COVID-19 by county in NYS were extracted from the US Health Data system at four critical time points including March 17th (state of emergency, 4.40 per 100,000 people), April 18th (coronavirus peak, 310.10 per 100,000 people), April 25th (expand testing, 393.90 per 100,000 people), and May 11th (daily increased rate back to the level in March, 505.30 per 100,000 people. A total of 28 county-level predictors were used to construct the prediction model, and the generalized linear mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to select the predictors of COVID-19 outbreak across the counties in NYS with adjusting for time effect. Result(s): The CCCR by the final timepoint was 1,850.3 per 100,000 people. Rockland County had the highest CCCR than any other counties, with a rate of 3,856.82 per 100,000 people, while Chautauqua and Franklin counties had the lowest CCCR (0.03 per 100,000 people). LASSO regression revealed counties with a larger proportion of non-citizen (beta=9537.97, p=0.02) had a higher CCCR of COVID-19 across the time. In contrast, counties with a lower proportion of people with at least high school education (beta=-6157.89, p=0.025) and a larger proportion of houses with less than 3 people (beta=-5995.79471, p=0.01) had lower CCCR. Conclusion(s): We identified immigrant status, education level and household type influenced the spatial variations of COVID-19 outbreak in NYS. Future interventions shall target on areas with greater density of non-citizens to prevent transmission.},

Previous studies have found high turnover rates among prison officers since the outbreak of COVID-19. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mediating role of job burnout between job demands and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of the perceived efficacy in overcoming COVID-19 in Chinese prison officers. In total, 1316 prison officers were recruited to complete an online questionnaire between May 2022 and June 2022 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The bootstrapping approach was used to assess the moderated mediation model in this study. The results showed that prison officers' job demands were positively associated with their turnover intention. Job burnout mediated the relationship between job demands and turnover intention. Perceived efficacy in overcoming COVID-19 moderated the effect of job burnout on turnover intention. Based on these results, suggestions were provided to reduce the high turnover rate of prison officers in public health events like the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {The rapid geographic spread of COVID-19, to which various factors may have contributed, has caused a global health crisis. Recently, the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic have attracted worldwide attention. In this work, a large COVID-19 data set consisting of COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 testing capacity, economic level, demographic information, and geographic location data in 184 countries and 1241 areas from December 18, 2019, to September 30, 2020, were developed from public reports released by national health authorities and bureau of statistics. We proposed a machine learning model for COVID-19 prediction based on the broad learning system (BLS). Here, we leveraged random forest (RF) to screen out the key features. Then, we combine the bagging strategy and BLS to develop a random-forest-bagging BLS (RF-Bagging-BLS) approach to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we compared the forecasting results with linear regression (LR) model, [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (Ada), RF, gradient boosting DT (GBDT), support vector regression (SVR), extra trees (ETs) regressor, CatBoost (CAT), LightGBM (LGB), XGBoost (XGB), and BLS. The RF-Bagging BLS model showed better forecasting performance in terms of relative mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]), adjusted coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]), median absolute error (MAD), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than other models. Hence, the proposed model demonstrates superior predictive power over other benchmark models.},

   abstract = {Objective To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China. Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073 (95% confidence interval, 41673 to 42475), 21342 (95% confidence interval, 21057 to 21629) and 13384 (95% confidence interval, 13158 to 13612) infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei), respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic should be under control in early April with very few new cases occasionally reported.Copyright © 2020 Zhang et al.

   journal = {Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)},
   volume = {33},
   number = {7},
   abstract = {Investigations on spreading dynamics based on complex networks have received widespread attention these years due to the COVID-19 epidemic, which are conducive to corresponding prevention policies. As for the COVID-19 epidemic itself, the latent time and mobile crowds are two important and inescapable factors that contribute to the significant prevalence. Focusing on these two factors, this paper systematically investigates the epidemic spreading in multiple spaces with mobile crowds. Specifically, we propose a SEIS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible) model that considers the latent time based on a multi-layer network with active nodes which indicate the mobile crowds. The steady-state equations and epidemic threshold of the SEIS model are deduced and discussed. And by comprehensively discussing the key model parameters, we find that (1) due to the latent time, there is a "cumulative effect" on the infected, leading to the "peaks" or "shoulders" of the curves of the infected individuals, and the system can switch among three states with the relative parameter combinations changing; (2) the minimal mobile crowds can also cause the significant prevalence of the epidemic at the steady state, which is suggested by the zero-point phase change in the proportional curves of infected individuals. These results can provide a theoretical basis for formulating epidemic prevention policies.Copyright © 2023 Author(s). Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor mental health status and associated risk factors of public health workers have been overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used the effort-reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHOD(S): A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULT(S): The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant. CONCLUSION(S): This study confirmed the harmful effects of effort and over-commitment on mental health among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Such effects could be alleviated through an appropriate reward system, especially the development and job acceptance dimensions of such a system. These findings highlight the importance of establishing an emergency reward system, comprising reasonable work-allocation mechanism, bonuses and honorary titles, a continuous education system and better career-development opportunities.},

   abstract = {The importation of COVID-19 cases in China is due to the returning of Chinese citizens abroad, where the majority of cases stand. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of importing COVID-19 into the Sichuan Province of China and conduct a short-term risk prediction assessment and analysis. Data on COVID-19 cases in each country and Sichuan were collected, as well as visitors to Sichuan, population, area, and medical resources in each city in Sichuan province. According to different control strategies of entry aviation and quarantine control, we built models of epidemic transmission to estimate the risk for imported COVID-19 cases in 21 cities of Sichuan. Within 140 days of the policy change's implementation, the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered people in all cities followed the same pattern over time: (1) the number of susceptible people declined slowly at first, then accelerated to reach a stable value; (2) the number of infections gradually increased to a peak, then decreased; and (3) the number of recovered patients gradually increased to a stable value. Under the four different scenarios, there were no significant differences between the risk peaks because the social distance did not change. However, the peak time would be delayed due to the implementation of flight control and nucleic acid detection measures. The improvement of foreign epidemics (reduction of attenuation factors) all delayed the arrival of the peak risk value in Chengdu by about 20 days; however, the size of the peak value did not change significantly. The improvement of nucleic acid detection accuracy delayed the arrival of the peak risk value in Chengdu, but the size of the peak value did not change significantly. Therefore, flight control and the improvement of nucleic acid detection accuracy and overseas epidemic situations have positively affected the prevention and control of the epidemic in Sichuan.Copyright © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

In this study, we address the modeling of COVID-19 spread across space and time, which facilitates understanding of the pandemic. We propose a hybrid data-driven learning approach to capture the mobility-related spreading mechanism of infectious diseases, utilizing multi-sourced mobility and attributed data. This study develops a visual analytic approach that identifies and depicts the strength of the transmission pathways of COVID-19 between areal units by integrating data-driven deep learning and compartmental epidemic models, thereby engaging stakeholders (e.g., public health officials, managers from transportation agencies) to make informed intervention decisions and enable public messaging. A case study in the state of Colorado, USA was performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed transmission modeling approach in understanding the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 at the neighborhood level. Transmission path maps are presented and analyzed, demonstrating their utility in evaluating the effects of mitigation measures. In addition, integrated embeddings also support daily prediction of infected cases and role analysis of each area unit during the transmission of the virus. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Extreme public health interventions play a critical role in mitigating the local and global prevalence and pandemic potential. Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of COVID-19. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion. With applications to COVID-19, we estimate the mean of the effective reproductive number of China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.4626 (95% CI: 2.4142-2.5111) and 3.0979 (95% CI: 3.0968-3.0990), respectively. The prediction results show the effectiveness of the stochastic epidemic dynamic model with nonlinear filtering. The hidden Markov dynamic system with nonlinear filtering can be used to make analysis, nowcasting and forecasting for other contagious diseases in the future since it helps to understand the mechanism of disease transmission and to estimate the population size for pathogen transmission and the number of hidden infections, which is a valid tool for decision-making by policy makers for epidemic control.Copyright © 2021.

   abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on 11th March 2020 the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. The traditional infectious disease surveillance had failed to alert public health authorities to intervene in time and mitigate and control the COVID-19 before it became a pandemic. Compared with traditional public health surveillance, harnessing the rich data from social media, including Twitter, has been considered a useful tool and can overcome the limitations of the traditional surveillance system. This paper proposes an intelligent COVID-19 early warning system using Twitter data with novel machine learning methods. We use the natural language processing (NLP) pre-training technique, i.e., fine-tuning BERT as a Twitter classification method. Moreover, we implement a COVID-19 forecasting model through a Twitter-based linear regression model to detect early signs of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we develop an expert system, an early warning web application based on the proposed methods. The experimental results suggest that it is feasible to use Twitter data to provide COVID-19 surveillance and prediction in the US to support health departments' decision-making.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the patterns of lifestyle and posed psychological stress on pregnant women. However, the association of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety among pregnant women under the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario has been poorly addressed. We conducted one large-scale, multicenter cross-sectional study which recruited 1794 pregnant women across middle and west China. Self-reported demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and mental health status were collected from 6th February to 8th May 2020. We investigated the association of sleep duration and screen time with the risk of anxiety by multivariable logistic regression analysis and linear regression analysis after adjusting potential confounders. The dose-response relationship of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety was visualized using a cubic spline plot. Our data revealed that almost 35% of pregnant women suffered from anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep duration was dose-dependently associated with a lower risk of anxiety among pregnant women (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.63), while screen time exhibited a conversed effect (OR = 2.01, 95% CI:1.00-4.39). Notably, sleep duration (>=8 h/day) synergistically combined with screen time (3-7 h/day) to diminish the risk of anxiety (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.99). Taken together, sleep duration and screen time were independently and jointly associated with anxiety (P < 0.05). Therefore, promoting a more active lifestyle and maintaining higher sleep quality could improve the mental health of pregnant women, especially under public health emergency.

   abstract = {As COVID-19 shows a heterogeneous spreading process globally, investigating factors associated with COVID-19 spreading among different countries will provide information for containment strategy and medical service decisions. A significant challenge for analyzing how these factors impact COVID-19 transmission is assessing key epidemiological parameters and how they change under different containment strategies across different nations. This paper builds a COVID-19 spread simulation model to estimate the core COVID-19 epidemiological parameters. Then, the correlation between these core COVID-19 epidemiological parameters and the times of publicly announced interventions is analyzed, including three typical countries, China (strictly containment), the USA (moderately control), and Sweden (loose control). Results show that the recovery rate leads to a distinct COVID-19 transmission process in the three countries, as all three countries finally have similar and close to zero spreading rates in the third period of COVID-19 transmission. Then, an epidemic fundamental diagram between COVID-19 "active infections" and "current patients" is discovered, which could plan a country's COVID-19 medical capacity and containment strategies when combined with the COVID-19 spreading simulation model. Based on that, the hypothetical policies are proved effectively, which will give support for future infectious diseases. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The emergence of mutant strains such as Omicron has increased the uncertainty of COVID-19, and all countries have taken strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The spread of the disease between countries is of particular concern. However, most COVID-19 research focuses mainly on the country or community, and there is less research on the border areas between two countries. In this study, we analyzed changes in the total nighttime light intensity (TNLI) and total nighttime lit area (TNLA) along the Sino-Burma border and used the data to construct an epidemic pressure input index (PII) model in reference to the Shen potential model. The results show that, as the epidemic became more severe, TNLI on both sides of the border at the Ruili border port increased, while that in areas far from the port decreased. At the same time, increases and decreases in TNLA occurred in areas far from the port, and PII can indicate the areas where imported cases are likely to occur. Along the Sino-Burma border, the PII model showed low PII in the north and south and high PII in the central region. The areas between Dehong and Lincang, especially the Ruili, Wanding, Nansan, and Qingshuihe border ports, had high PII. The results of this study offer a reference for public health officials and decision makers when determining resource allocation and the implementation of stricter quarantine rules. With updated epidemic statistics, PII can be recalculated to support timely monitoring of COVID-19 in border areas. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of the dynamics of new SARS-CoV-2 infections during the current COVID-19 pandemic is critical for public health planning of efficient health care allocation and monitoring the effects of policy interventions. We describe a new approach that forecasts the number of incident cases in the near future given past occurrences using only a small number of assumptions., METHODS: Our approach to forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves 1) modeling the observed incidence cases using a Poisson distribution for the daily incidence number, and a gamma distribution for the series interval; 2) estimating the effective reproduction number assuming its value stays constant during a short time interval; and 3) drawing future incidence cases from their posterior distributions, assuming that the current transmission rate will stay the same, or change by a certain degree., RESULTS: We apply our method to predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in a single state in the U.S. and for a subset of counties within the state to demonstrate the utility of this method at varying scales of prediction. Our method produces reasonably accurate results when the effective reproduction number is distributed similarly in the future as in the past. Large deviations from the predicted results can imply that a change in policy or some other factors have occurred that have dramatically altered the disease transmission over time., CONCLUSION: We presented a modelling approach that we believe can be easily adopted by others, and immediately useful for local or state planning.},

   abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in China and more than 30 countries over last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures., Methods: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models., Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty., Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran., Supplementary Materials: The supplementary materials can be found online with this article at 10.1007/s40484-020-0199-0.

   abstract = {Background: In 2015-2016, Zika virus (ZIKV) caused serious epidemics in Brazil. The key epidemiological parameters and spatial heterogeneity of ZIKV epidemics in different states in Brazil remain unclear. Early prediction of the final epidemic (or outbreak) size for ZIKV outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making and mitigation planning. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity in the epidemiological features of ZIKV across eight different Brazilian states by using simple non-linear growth models. Result(s): We fitted three different models to the weekly reported ZIKV cases in eight different states and obtained an R 2 larger than 0.995. The estimated average values of basic reproduction numbers from different states varied from 2.07 to 3.41, with a mean of 2.77. The estimated turning points of the epidemics also varied across different states. The estimation of turning points nevertheless is stable and real-time. The forecast of the final epidemic size (attack rate) is reasonably accurate, shortly after the turning point. The knowledge of the epidemic turning point is crucial for accurate real-time projection of the outbreak. Conclusion(s): Our simple models fitted the epidemic reasonably well and thus revealed the spatial heterogeneity in the epidemiological features across Brazilian states. The knowledge of the epidemic turning point is crucial for real-time projection of the outbreak size. Our real-time estimation framework is able to yield a reliable prediction of the final epidemic size.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The burden of vector-borne diseases (Dengue, Zika virus, yellow fever, etc.) gradually increased in the past decade across the globe. Mathematical modelling on infectious diseases helps to study the transmission dynamics of the pathogens. Theoretically, the diseases can be controlled and eventually eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number, (Reff), strictly less than 1. We established a vector-host compartmental model, and derived (Reff) for vector-borne diseases. The analytic form of the (Reff) was found to be the product of the basic reproduction number and the geometric average of the susceptibilities of the host and vector populations. The (Reff) formula was demonstrated to be consistent with the estimates of the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, and distinguished the second minor epidemic wave. For those using the compartmental model to study the vector-borne infectious disease epidemics, we further remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition "from host to vector to host" in reproduction number calculation.Copyright © 2020 Zhao et al.},

   abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China on December 2019 in patients presenting with atypical pneumonia. Although 'city-lockdown' policy reduced the spatial spreading of the COVID-19, the city-level outbreaks within each city remain a major concern to be addressed. The local or regional level disease control mainly depends on individuals self-administered infection prevention actions. The contradiction between choice of taking infection prevention actions or not makes the elimination difficult under a voluntary acting scheme, and represents a clash between the optimal choice of action for the individual interest and group interests. Method(s): We develop a compartmental epidemic model based on the classic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model and use this to fit the data. Behavioral imitation through a game theoretical decision-making process is incorporated to study and project the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. By varying the key model parameters, we explore the probable course of the outbreak in terms of size and timing under several public interventions in improving public awareness and sensitivity to the infection risk as well as their potential impact. Result(s): We estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, to be 2.5 (95% CI: 2.4-2.7). Under the current most realistic setting, we estimate the peak size at 0.28 (95% CI: 0.24-0.32) infections per 1,000 population. In Wuhan, the final size of the outbreak is likely to infect 1.35% (95% CI: 1.00-2.12%) of the population. The outbreak will be most likely to peak in the first half of February and drop to daily incidences lower than 10 in June 2020. Increasing sensitivity to take infection prevention actions and the effectiveness of infection prevention measures are likely to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Conclusion(s): Through an imitating social learning process, individual-level behavioral change on taking infection prevention actions have the potentials to significantly reduce the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of size and timing at city-level. Timely and substantially resources and supports for improving the willingness-to-act and conducts of self-administered infection prevention actions are recommended to reduce to the COVID-19 associated risks.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

   abstract = {Infectious diseases generally spread along with the asymmetry of social network propagation because the asymmetry of urban development and the prevention strategies often affect the direction of the movement. But the spreading mechanism of the epidemic remains to explore in the directed network. In this paper, the main effect of the directed network and delay on the dynamic behaviors of the epidemic is investigated. The algebraic expressions of Turing instability are given to show the role of the directed network in the spread of the epidemic, which overcomes the drawback that undirected networks cannot lead to the outbreaks of infectious diseases. Then, Hopf bifurcation is analyzed to illustrate the dynamic mechanism of the periodic outbreak, which is consistent with the transmission of COVID-19. Also, the discrepancy ratio between the imported and the exported is proposed to explain the importance of quarantine policies and the spread mechanism. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by numerical simulation.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To observe the psychological status of pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic, and to test a hypothetical model that estimates the influence of psychological response to COVID-19 and security sense on pregnancy stress. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 advanced rapidly and then spread worldwide. Pregnant women were more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this infection will increase the risk of congenital monstrosity, foetal growth restriction, premature delivery or cause other long-term adverse effects. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey. METHOD(S): A total of 331 pregnant women participated in this study. And this research adhered to the STROBE guideline. The psychological questionnaire for emergent events of public health, pregnancy stress scale and security questionnaire were used to collect data. The hypothetical path model was tested using the SPSS version 25.0 software and AMOS version 26.0 software. RESULT(S): Fear and depression were the most common psychological responses among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis model of this study fitted the data well, and the results showed that psychological response positively affected pregnancy stress, while security sense negatively affected pregnancy stress; security sense mediated between psychological response and pregnancy stress. CONCLUSION(S): Nurses and midwives can help reduce the stress in pregnant women by alleviating their psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by improving their security sense. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is essential for the health staff to build trust with pregnant women and their families, and communicate accurate information to them. Nurses should promptly conduct a psychological response evaluation and psychological guidance for pregnant women to alleviate their fears and hypochondria related to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Understanding the spread of infectious diseases is an extremely essential step to preventing them. Thus, correct modeling and simulation approaches are critical for elucidating the transmission of infectious diseases and improving the control of epidemics. The primary objective of this study is to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban rail transit station. Data were collected by a field investigation in the city of Ningbo, China. A SEIR-based model was developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in Tianyi station, considering four groups of passengers (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) and a 14-day incubation period. Based on the historical data of infectious diseases, the parameters of the SEIR infectious disease model were clarified, and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was also performed. The results showed that the contact rate (CR), infectivity (I), and average illness duration (AID) were positively correlated with the number of infections. It was also found that the length of the average incubation time (AIT) was positively correlated with the number of exposed individuals and negatively correlated with the number of infectors. These simulation results provide support for the validity and reliability of using the SEIR model in studies of the spread of epidemics and facilitate the development of effective measures to prevent and control an epidemic.Copyright © 2021 Zhou et al.},

   volume = {9},

   pages = {76},
   abstract = {Background: As COVID-19 makes its way around the globe, each nation must decide when and how to respond. Yet many knowledge gaps persist, and many countries lack the capacity to develop complex models to assess risk and response. This paper aimed to meet this need by developing a model that uses case reporting data as input and provides a four-tiered risk assessment output. Method(s): We used publicly available, country/territory level case reporting data to determine median seeding number, mean seeding time (ST), and several measures of mean doubling time (DT) for COVID-19. We then structured our model as a coordinate plane with ST on the x-axis, DT on the y-axis, and mean ST and mean DT dividing the plane into four quadrants, each assigned a risk level. Sensitivity analysis was performed and countries/territories early in their outbreaks were assessed for risk. Result(s): Our main finding was that among 45 countries/territories evaluated, 87% were at high risk for their outbreaks entering a rapid growth phase epidemic. We furthermore found that the model was sensitive to changes in DT, and that these changes were consistent with what is officially known of cases reported and control strategies implemented in those countries. Conclusion(s): Our main finding is that the ST/DT Model can be used to produce meaningful assessments of the risk of escalation in country/territory-level COVID-19 epidemics using only case reporting data. Our model can help support timely, decisive action at the national level as leaders and other decision makers face of the serious public health threat that is COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in China and the Chinese government took a series of policies to control the epidemic. Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections. At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries.

   abstract = {Risk assessment of the intra-city spatio-temporal spreading of COVID-19 is important for providing location-based precise intervention measures, especially when the epidemic occurred in the densely populated and high mobile public places. The individual-based simulation has been proven to be an effective method for the risk assessment. However, the acquisition of individual-level mobility data is limited. This study used publicly available datasets to approximate dynamic intra-city travel flows by a spatio-temporal gravity model. On this basis, an individual-based epidemic model integrating agent-based model with the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model was proposed and the intra-city spatio-temporal spreading process of COVID-19 in eleven public places in Guangzhou China were explored. The results indicated that the accuracy of dynamic intra-city travel flows estimated by available big data and gravity model is acceptable. The spatio-temporal simulation method well presented the process of COVID-19 epidemic. Four kinds of spatial-temporal transmission patterns were identified and the pattern was highly dependent on the urban spatial structure and location. It indicated that location-based precise intervention measures should be implemented according to different regions. The approach of this research can be used by policy-makers to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to implement intervention measures ahead of epidemic outbreaks.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the global spread of COVID-19, detecting high-risk countries/regions timely and dynamically is essential; therefore, we sought to develop automatic, quantitative and scalable analysis methods to observe and estimate COVID-19 spread worldwide and further generate reliable and timely decision-making support for public health management using a comprehensive modeling method based on multiple mathematical models. METHOD(S): We collected global COVID-19 epidemic data reported from January 23 to September 30, 2020, to observe and estimate its possible spread trends. Countries were divided into three outbreak levels: high, middle, and low. Trends analysis was performed by calculating the growth rate, and then country grouping was implemented using group-based trajectory modeling on the three levels. Individual countries from each group were also chosen to further disclose the outbreak situations using two predicting models: the logistic growth model and the SEIR model. RESULT(S): All 187 observed countries' trajectory subgroups were identified using two grouping strategies: with and without population consideration. By measuring epidemic trends and predicting the epidemic size and peak of individual countries, our study found that the logistic growth model generally estimated a smaller epidemic size than the SEIR model. According to SEIR modeling, confirmed cases in each country would take an average of 9-12 months to reach the outbreak peak from the day the first case occurred. Additionally, the average number of cases at the peak time will reach approximately 10-20% of the countries' populations, and the countries with high trends and a high predicted size must pay special attention and implement public health interventions in a timely manner. CONCLUSION(S): We demonstrated comprehensive observations and predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in 187 countries using a comprehensive modeling method. The methods proposed in this study can measure COVID-19 development from multiple perspectives and are generalizable to other epidemic diseases. Furthermore, the methods also provide reliable and timely decision-making support for public health management.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).},

   title = {Individual preferences, government policy, and COVID-19: A game-theoretic epidemiological analysis},
   journal = {Applied mathematical modelling},
   volume = {122},
   pages = {401-416},
   abstract = {Purpose: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic imposes serious short-term and long-term health costs on populations. Restrictive government policy measures decrease the risks of infection, but produce similarly serious social, mental health, and economic problems. Citizens have varying preferences about the desirability of restrictive policies, and governments are thus forced to navigate this tension in making pandemic policy. This paper analyses the situation facing government using a game-theoretic epidemiological model., Methodology: We classify individuals into health-centered individuals and freedom-centered individuals to capture the heterogeneous preferences of citizens. We first use the extended Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered (SEAIR) model (adding individual preferences) and the signaling game model (adding government) to analyze the strategic situation against the backdrop of a realistic model of COVID-19 infection., Findings: We find the following: 1. There exists two pooling equilibria. When health-centered and freedom-centered individuals send anti-epidemic signals, the government will adopt strict restrictive policies under budget surplus or balance. When health-centered and freedom-centered individuals send freedom signals, the government chooses not to implement restrictive policies. 2. When governments choose not to impose restrictions, the extinction of an epidemic depends on whether it has a high infection transmission rate; when the government chooses to implement non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), whether an epidemic will disappear depends on how strict the government's restrictions are., Originality/value: Based on the existing literature, we add individual preferences and put the government into the game as a player. Our research extends the current form of combining epidemiology and game theory. By using both we get a more realistic understanding of the spread of the virus and combine that with a richer understanding of the strategic social dynamics enabled by game theoretic analysis. Our findings have important implications for public management and government decision-making in the context of COVID-19 and for potential future public health emergencies.

   journal = {Bulletin of mathematical biology},
   volume = {84},

   pages = {92},
   abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) recently reemerged in the Americas and rapidly expanded in global range. It is posing significant concerns of public health due to its link to birth defects and its complicated transmission routes. Southeast Asia is badly hit by ZIKV, but limited information was found on the transmission potential of ZIKV in the region. In this paper, we develop a new dynamic process-based mathematical model, which incorporates the interactions among humans (sexual transmissibility), and between human and mosquitoes (biting transmissibility), as well as the essential impacts of temperature. The model is first validated by fitting the 2016 ZIKV outbreak in Singapore via Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Based on that, we demonstrate the effects of temperature on mosquito ecology and ZIKV transmission, and further clarify the potential risk of ZIKV outbreak in Southeast Asian countries. The results show that (i) the estimated infection reproduction number [Formula: see text] in Singapore fell from 6.93 (in which the contribution of sexual transmission was 0.89) to 0.24 after the deployment of control strategies; (ii) the optimal temperature for the reproduction of ZIKV infections and adult mosquitoes are estimated to be [Formula: see text]C and [Formula: see text]C, respectively; and (iii) the [Formula: see text] in Southeast Asia could be between 3 and 7, with an inverted-U shape around the year. The large values of [Formula: see text] and the simulative patterns of ZIKV transmission in each country highlights the high risk of ZIKV attack in Southeast Asia.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {Epidemic models are being used by governments to inform public health strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). The relationship between public health interventions and [Formula: see text] was explored, firstly using a hierarchical clustering algorithm on initial [Formula: see text] patterns, and secondly computing the time-lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented, [Formula: see text], and daily incidence counts in subsequent months. The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag). Lastly, the outbreak prediction accuracy of the model using dynamically updated [Formula: see text] produced an average AUROC of 0.72 (0.708, 0.723) compared to 0.56 (0.555, 0.568) when [Formula: see text] was kept constant. Monitoring the evolution of [Formula: see text] during an epidemic is an important complementary piece of information to reported daily counts, recoveries and deaths, since it provides an early signal of the efficacy of containment measures. Using updated [Formula: see text] values produces significantly better predictions of future outbreaks. Our results found variation in the effect of early public health interventions on the evolution of [Formula: see text] over time and across countries, which could not be explained solely by the timing and number of the adopted interventions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that can cause serious public health hazard. Due to its huge threat to the society, precise real-time forecasting of influenza outbreaks is of great value to our public. RESULT(S): In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network structure that forecasts a real-time influenza-like illness rate (ILI%) in Guangzhou, China. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks is applied to precisely forecast accurateness due to the long-term attribute and diversity of influenza epidemic data. We devise a multi-channel LSTM neural network that can draw multiple information from different types of inputs. We also add attention mechanism to improve forecasting accuracy. By using this structure, we are able to deal with relationships between multiple inputs more appropriately. Our model fully consider the information in the data set, targetedly solving practical problems of the Guangzhou influenza epidemic forecasting. CONCLUSION(S): We assess the performance of our model by comparing it with different neural network structures and other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our model has strong competitiveness and can provide effective real-time influenza epidemic forecasting.},

   abstract = {Since December 2019, a disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) had infected many people and the cumulative confirmed cases have reached almost 180,000 as of 17, March 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak was believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, a metropolis city of more than 11 million population in Hubei province, China. We introduced a statistical disease transmission model using case symptom onset data to estimate the transmissibility of the early-phase outbreak in China, and provided sensitivity analyses with various assumptions of disease natural history of the COVID-19. We fitted the transmission model to several publicly available sources of the outbreak data until 11, February 2020, and estimated lock down intervention efficacy of Wuhan city. The estimated R was between 2.7 and 4.2 from plausible distribution assumptions of the incubation period and relative infectivity over the infectious period. 95% confidence interval of R were also reported. Potential issues such as data quality concerns and comparison of different modelling approaches were discussed.Copyright © 2020, International Chinese Statistical Association.},

   abstract = {Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it became urgent to deal with the relationship between the prevention and control of the epidemic and the resumption of work and production. The purpose of this study is to observe and describe which approach seemed more important for the Chinese government and people, and how this trend evolved through time. To this end, a game model of resuming production and preventing the epidemic is constructed, using the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). By combing China's measures on epidemic prevention and resuming production during critical periods of epidemic outbreak, it is clarified that the present stage is considered a period of equal emphasis on both epidemic prevention and resuming production. Based on the dynamic between these two strategies and further theoretical research, present policies should equally focus on both preventive and controlling measures as well as on the socioeconomic development for most countries in the world.

   abstract = {Stochastic transmission dynamic models are needed to quantify the uncertainty in estimates and predictions during outbreaks of infectious diseases. We previously developed a calibration method for stochastic epidemic compartmental models, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), and demonstrated its competitive performance against a number of existing state-of-the-art calibration methods. The existing MSS method, however, lacks a mechanism against filter degeneracy, a phenomenon that results in parameter posterior distributions that are weighted heavily around a single value. As such, when filter degeneracy occurs, the posterior distributions of parameter estimates will not yield reliable credible or prediction intervals for parameter estimates and predictions. In this work, we extend the MSS method by evaluating and incorporating two resampling techniques to detect and resolve filter degeneracy. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that an extended MSS method produces credible and prediction intervals with desired coverage in estimating key epidemic parameters (e.g. mean duration of infectiousness and R0) and short- and long-term predictions (e.g. one and three-week forecasts, timing and number of cases at the epidemic peak, and final epidemic size). Applying the extended MSS approach to a humidity-based stochastic compartmental influenza model, we were able to accurately predict influenza-like illness activity reported by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 10 regions as well as city-level influenza activity using real-time, city-specific Google search query data from 119 U.S. cities between 2003 and 2014.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.},

   pages = {200-216},
   abstract = {We applied a queuing model to inform ventilator capacity planning during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The core of our framework is a multi-class Erlang loss model that represents ventilator use by both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Input for the model includes COVID-19 case projections, and our analysis incorporates projections with different levels of transmission due to public health measures and social distancing. We incorporated data from the BC Intensive Care Unit Database to calibrate and validate the model. Using discrete event simulation, we projected ventilator access, including when capacity would be reached and how many patients would be unable to access a ventilator. Simulation results were compared with three numerical approximation methods, namely pointwise stationary approximation, modified offered load, and fixed point approximation. Using this comparison, we developed a hybrid optimization approach to efficiently identify required ventilator capacity to meet access targets. Model projections demonstrate that public health measures and social distancing potentially averted up to 50 deaths per day in BC, by ensuring that ventilator capacity was not reached during the first wave of COVID-19. Without these measures, an additional 173 ventilators would have been required to ensure that at least 95% of patients can access a ventilator immediately. Our model enables policy makers to estimate critical care utilization based on epidemic projections with different transmission levels, thereby providing a tool to quantify the interplay between public health measures, necessary critical care resources, and patient access indicators.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {Shenzhen is a city of 22 million people in south China that serves as a financial and trade center for East Asia. The city has extensive ties to Hubei Province, the first reported epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the world. Initial predictions suggested Shenzhen would experience a high number of COVID-19 cases. These predictions have not materialized. As of 31 March 2020 Shenzhen had only 451 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Contact tracing has shown that no cases were the result of community transmission within the city. While Shenzhen did not implement a citywide lockdown like Wuhan, it did put into place a rapid response system first developed after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Shenzhen health authority created a network for surveillance and responding to novel respiratory infections, including pneumonia of unknown causes (PUC). The network rapidly detected mass discussion about PUC and immediately deployed emergency preparedness, quarantine for close contacts of PUC. Five early actions (early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment) and four centralized responses (centralized coordination by experts, centralized allocation of resources, centralized placement of patients, and centralized provision of treatment) ensured effective prevention and control. Tripartite working teams comprising community cadres, medical personnel and police were formulated to conduct contact tracing at each neighborhood and residential community. Incorporation of mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence into COVID-19 response increased accessibility to health services, reduced misinformation and minimized the impact of fake news. Shenzhen's unique experience in successfully controlling the COVID-19 outbreak may be a useful model for countries and regions currently experiencing rapid spread of the virus.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).},
