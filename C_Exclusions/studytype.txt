However, there has been no analysis that measures the potential magnitude of the problem or proposes a solution. In this article I combine the pandemic forecasting model used by the federal government with estimates of ventilator availability from the literature to assess the expected shortage under various scenarios. I then propose that the federal government organize a national effort for ventilators to be exchanged between states to take advantage of the intertemporal differences in demand peaks. I evaluate versions of this proposal, including use of the national stockpile, to estimate the potentially substantial number of lives that could be saved. In the absence of other viable solutions, the government should begin this effort in earnest, or else make preparations for such coordination should the country face another pandemic in the future.},

   abstract = {Background. We previously demonstrated higher odds of depression in PLWH during COVID-19 pandemic in our African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) between 07May2020 and 01Dec2021.1 This analysis updates the previous and estimates odds of depressive symptoms through 01Dec2022. Hypothesis: If the pandemic was truly associated with depressive symptoms in PLWH then odds of depressive symptoms will continue the downward trend identified in later timepoints of our first analysis. Methods. AFRICOS: Ongoing prospective cohort study enrolling PLWH at 12 clinics in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria.2 Longitudinal evaluations every 6 months include physical evaluation, medical record abstraction, extensive questionnaires including CES-D; depression defined by score >16.3 We compared odds of depression in preCOVID-19 period (1 Jan 2019 to 19 Mar 2020) with five timepoints in COVID-19 era (7 May 2020 to 1 Dec 2022). Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations for OR and 95% CI comparing depression before and during pandemic. Models a priori adjusted for sex, age, and site. Results. 2,038 AFRICOS participants with complete cases and visits before and during COVID-19 periods included. Median age at first visit included: 43 years (IQR 36-51) 1,181 (57.9%) were female Depression varied significantly by: sex, participants by site, marital status, ART adherence at first timepoint included (Table 1). 60 (2.9%) participants had CES-D score suggestive of depression at first visit included. Compared with pre-pandemic: PLWH had higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms throughout pandemic. After adjusting for age, sex, and site, PLWH had higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms only in second, third, fourth parts of pandemic period, aORs: 1.62 (95% CI 1.13 - 2.31), 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.31), 1.41 (1.01 - 1.96) respectively (Table 2, Figure). Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic is associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms in PLWH in AFRICOS. Odds of depression increased as pandemic progressed, peaking in third period and decreasing sequentially in fourth, fifth periods to confirm our hypothesis. Given the strong association between depression and HIV outcomes, aggressive public health mental health response to pandemics may improve HIV clinical outcomes.},

   abstract = {Qualitative research and comprehensive public awareness to nip the transmission of Ebola virus in the bud before it becomes a global threat is fast becoming imperative especially now that the Gambia Ebola virus is mutated. It is therefore necessary to consider and investigate a vector-host transmission model for possible control strategy of this deadly disease. Hence, in this study, we presented a novel and feasible human-bat (host-vector) Sh Eh Ih Rh i s Rh n i - Sb Eb Ib model which foretells the spread and severity of the Ebola virus from bats to humans to investigate the combined effects of three control strategies viz: (1) allowing specialized and designated agencies to bury deceased from Ebola infection without relatives touching or curdling the remains as usually practiced in most part of Africa as last respect for their departed love ones ( k1 ), (2) systematic and deliberate depopulation of bats in the metropolis (through persecution with pesticide exposure, pre capturing, chemical timber treatment for roosts destruction) to discourage hunting them for food by virtue of their proximity ( k2 ) and (3) immediate treatment of infected individuals in isolation ( k3 ). We established, among others, the endemic equilibrium, disease-free equilibrium, global and local stability, non-negativity, and boundedness of the model to prove the epidemiological feasibility of the model. The reality of the presence of optimal control remarkably influences the dynamics of transmission of the virus and simulated results also confirm the great effect of the combination of the control strategies k1 , k2 and k3 in flattening the curve of Ebola transmission (fig 1 - fig 8). Health workers and policy makers are better informed with fundamental precautions that could help eradicate Ebola from the populace. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).},

   journal = {Birth},
   volume = {51},
   number = {2},
   pages = {432-440},
   abstract = {Background: Often marginalized and disadvantaged by systems of oppression, Indigenous populations commonly face significant barriers to accessing adequate antenatal care (ANC). The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on healthcare systems worldwide, including on the provision of antenatal care; this was especially so for Indigenous communities in many regions. As such, our study aimed to estimate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and adequate ANC received by Indigenous women in Chiapas, Mexico. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective crossover analysis with data collected between June and December 2021 from Indigenous women who attended at least one ANC appointment at one of two health centers in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. We used a multinomial logistic regression model considering the time frame (before and during the pandemic) as the primary independent variable. Adequate antenatal care comprised four dimensions: attendance by qualified personnel, timely first visit, sufficient frequency of visits, and adequacy of the content provided during the visits. Result(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant drop in ANC adequacy, with 12.7% (95% CI: 8.3, 18.9) of Indigenous women receiving ANC, compared with the pre-pandemic rate of 52.5% (95% CI: 44.7, 60.3), among the 158 participants. The pandemic resulted in a reduction of 75.8% in the adequacy of ANC. Considering the four dimensions of adequacy, we found that having only one dimension was associated with a relative risk ratio (RRR) of 12.45 (95% CI: 6.40, 24.23), while having two or three dimensions was associated with a RRR of 5.23 (95% CI: 2.83, 9.65) when using adequate ANC as the category of reference. Conclusion(s): According to our results, Indigenous women's ANC adequacy was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of these findings, we emphasize the importance of developing healthcare systems that are prepared to adapt consultation schemes by implementing virtual visits and incorporating community health workers.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: Variation in the approaches taken to contain the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic at country level has been shaped by economic and political considerations, technical capacity, and assumptions about public behaviours. To address the limited application of learning from previous pandemics, this study aimed to analyse perceived facilitators and inhibitors during the pandemic and to inform the development of an assessment tool for pandemic response planning. Method(s): A cross-sectional electronic survey of health and non-health care professionals (5 May - 5 June 2020) in six languages, with respondents recruited via email, social media and website posting. Participants were asked to score inhibitors (-10 to 0) or facilitators (0 to +10) impacting country response to COVID-19 from the following domains - Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Ecological, Legislative, and wider Industry (the PESTELI framework). Participants were then asked to explain their responses using free text. Descriptive and thematic analysis was followed by triangulation with the literature and expert validation to develop the assessment tool, which was then compared with four existing pandemic planning frameworks. Result(s): 928 respondents from 66 countries (57% health care professionals) participated. Political and economic influences were consistently perceived as powerful negative forces and technology as a facilitator across high- and low-income countries. The 103-item tool developed for guiding rapid situational assessment for pandemic planning is comprehensive when compared to existing tools and highlights the interconnectedness of the 7 domains. Conclusion(s): The tool developed and proposed addresses the problems associated with decision making in disciplinary silos and offers a means to refine future use of epidemic modelling.Copyright © 2021 by the Journal of Global Health.

   title = {Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on smoking (waterpipe and cigarette) and participants' BMI across various sociodemographic groups in Arab countries in the Mediterranean Region},
   journal = {Tobacco Induced Diseases},
   volume = {20},
   number = {November},
   pages = {98},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smokers are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Lockdown was a chosen strategy to deal with the spread of infectious diseases; nonetheless, it influenced people's eating and smoking behaviors. The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on smoking (waterpipe and cigarette) behavior and its associations with sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index. METHOD(S): The data were derived from a large-scale retrospective cross-sectional study using a validated online international survey from 38 countries (n=37207) conducted between 17 April and 25 June 2020. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMR countries) data related to 10 Arabic countries that participated in this survey have been selected for analysis in this study. A total of 12433 participants were included in the analysis of this study, reporting their smoking behavior and their BMI before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between smoking practices and the participant's country of origin, sociodemographic characteristics, and BMI (kg/m2). RESULT(S): Overall, the prevalence rate of smoking decreased significantly during the lockdown from 29.8% to 23.5% (p<0.05). The percentage of females who smoke was higher than males among the studied population. The highest smoking prevalence was found in Lebanon (33.2%), and the lowest was in Oman (7.9%). In Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, the data showed a significant difference in the education level of smokers before and during the lockdown (p<0.05). Smokers in Lebanon had lower education levels than those in other countries, where the majority of smokers had a Bachelor's degree. The findings show that the BMI rates in Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, and Saudi Arabia significantly increased during the lockdown (p<0.05). The highest percentages of obesity among smokers before the lockdown were in Oman (33.3%), followed by Bahrain (28.4%) and Qatar (26.4%), whereas, during the lockdown, the percentage of obese smokers was highest in Bahrain (32.1%) followed by Qatar (31.3%) and Oman (25%). According to the logistic regression model, the odds ratio of smoking increased during the pandemic, whereas the odds ratio of TV watching decreased. This finding was statistically significant by age, gender, education level, country of residence, and work status. CONCLUSION(S): Although the overall rates of smoking among the studied countries decreased during the lockdown period, we cannot attribute this change in smoking behavior to the lockdown. Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with changes in daily tobacco consumption. Public health authorities should promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles to reduce the long-term negative effects of the lockdown.Copyright © 2022 Al Sabbah H. et al.},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family that has serious effects on respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. COVID-19 spreads quickly worldwide and affects more than 41.5 million persons (till 23 October 2020). It has a high hazard to the safety and health of people all over the world. COVID-19 has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, strict special policies and plans should be made to face this pandemic. Forecasting COVID-19 cases in hotspot regions is a critical issue, as it helps the policymakers to develop their future plans. In this paper, we propose a new short term forecasting model using an enhanced version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). An improved marine predators algorithm (MPA), called chaotic MPA (CMPA), is applied to enhance the ANFIS and to avoid its shortcomings. More so, we compared the proposed CMPA with three artificial intelligence-based models include the original ANFIS, and two modified versions of ANFIS model using both of the original marine predators algorithm (MPA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The forecasting accuracy of the models was compared using different statistical assessment criteria. CMPA significantly outperformed all other investigated models.

   abstract = {The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was the most devastating pandemic of the 20th century. It killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide. In late 1918, when the severity of the disease was apparent, the Australian Quarantine Service was established. Vessels returning from overseas and inter-state were intercepted, and people were examined for signs of illness and quarantined. Some of these vessels carried the infection throughout their voyage and cases were prevalent by the time the ship arrived at a Quarantine Station. We study four outbreaks that took place on board the Medic, Boonah, Devon, and Manuka in late 1918. These ships had returned from overseas and some of them were carrying troops that served in the First World War. By analysing these outbreaks under a stochastic Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, we estimate the transmission rates among crew and passengers aboard these ships. Furthermore, we ask whether the removal of infectious, convalescent, and healthy individuals after arriving at a Quarantine Station in Australia was an effective public health response.Copyright: © 2023 Alahakoon et al.},

   abstract = {Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare their outcome with case-matched controls from the prepandemic phase. Method(s): This is a retrospective case-control study in which all patients with TBI admitted during COVID-19 pandemic phase (Arm A) from March 24, 2020 to November 30, 2020 were matched with age and Glasgow Coma Scale score-matched controls from the patients admitted before March 2020 (Arm B). Result(s): The total number of patients matched in each arm was 118. The length of hospital stay (8 days vs. 5 days; P < 0.001), transit time from emergency room to operation room (150 minutes vs. 97 minutes; P = 0.271), anesthesia induction time (75 minutes vs. 45 minutes; P = 0.002), and operative duration (275 minutes vs. 180 minutes; P = 0.002) were longer in arm A. Although the incidence of fever and pneumonia was significantly higher in arm A than in arm B (50% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.001 and 27.1% vs. 1.7%, P < 0.001, respectively), outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended) and mortality (18.6% vs. 14.4% respectively; P = 0.42) were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): The outcome of the patients managed for TBI during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to matched patients with TBI managed at our center before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the guidelines followed during the COVID-19 pandemic were effective in dealing with patients with TBI. This model can serve as a guide for any future pandemic waves for effective management of patients with TBI without compromising their outcome.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to prevent the prevalence of infectious diseases in vulnerable groups by anticipating the role of actors in implementing decision-making models in conditions of uncertainty in medical universities. Method(s): This research is an applied research by combining qualitative and quantitative methods based on the foundation data theory (Grand Theory). To determine the dimensions of the model, the statistical population included crisis management managers and faculty members of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. The data collection was done through targeted sampling and interviews, semi-structured interviews, analysis and coding methods. The statistical population to present the model includes senior and middle managers of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. The simple random sampling method based on the sample size was determined by Cochran's method, and the collected data from the researcher's questionnaire were analyzed through nonparametric statistical experiments, Kolmogorov test Smirnov, SPSS SMARTPLS, Excel and the method of modeling structural equations with the least squares approach has been partial. Result(s): The path coefficient of each dimension in explaining the decision model in uncertainty conditions based on T statistic and p value and SRMR value was 0.137, which was a good value and the main actors in implementing the model were policymakers, managers and staff. Conclusion(s): The implementation of this model will lead to a change in the decisions made by health system authorities in conditions of uncertainty, and will increase the ability of Head of medical universities and the resilience of the health system.Copyright © 2020 Babol University of Medical Sciences.

   abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the role of language proficiency and institutional awareness in explaining excess COVID-19 mortality among immigrants. Design Cohort study with follow-up between 12 March 2020 and 23 February 2021. Setting Swedish register-based study on all residents in Sweden. Participants 3 963 356 Swedish residents in co-residential unions who were 30 years of age or older and alive on 12 March 2020 and living in Sweden in December 2019. Outcome measures Cox regression models were conducted to assess the association between different constellations of immigrant-native couples (proxy for language proficiency and institutional awareness) and COVID-19 mortality and all other causes of deaths (2019 and 2020). Models were adjusted for relevant confounders. Results Compared with Swedish-Swedish couples (1.18 deaths per thousand person-years), both immigrants partnered with another immigrant and a native showed excess mortality for COVID-19 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.58 and HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.40, respectively), which translates to 1.37 and 1.28 deaths per thousand person-years. Moreover, similar results are found for natives partnered with an immigrant (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29), which translates to 1.29 deaths per thousand person-years. Further analysis shows that immigrants from both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) experience excess mortality also when partnered with a Swede. However, having a Swedish-born partner is only partially protective against COVID-19 mortality among immigrants from LMIC origins. Conclusions Language barriers and/or poor institutional awareness are not major drivers for the excess mortality from COVID-19 among immigrants. Rather, our study provides suggestive evidence that excess mortality among immigrants is explained by differential exposure to the virus.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Canadian Journal of Cardiology},
   volume = {36},
   number = {10 Supplement},
   pages = {S67-S68},
   abstract = {Background: To improve health outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients, guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be optimized to target doses. However, GDMT remains underutilized, with less than 25% of patients receiving target doses in clinical practice. Telemonitoring is part of the management of HF and could provide reliable and real-time physiological data for clinical decision support to facilitate remote titration of HF medication. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of remote titration facilitated by telemonitoring, its impact on the proportion of HF patients achieving target doses, time to dose optimization and the number of visits required to achieve target doses. Methods and Results: A 2-arm randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT), comparing remote titration vs. standard heart function clinic (HFC) care was conducted. Patients were randomized to undergo remote medication titration facilitated by data from the smartphone-based telemonitoring system Medly, or standard care titration performed during HFC visits. 42 patients with new onset (10 patients [23.8%]) and existing (32 patients [76.2%]) heart failure, mean age of 55.29 years (SD 11.28 years) were randomized between January and June 2019. Remote titration increased the proportion of patients that achieved target doses within 6 months of enrolment (85.7% for the intervention group vs. 47.6% in the control group), decreased the median time to dose optimization (11.0 weeks for the intervention group vs. 18.8 weeks for the control group) and reduced the number of in-person visits in the intervention group vs. the control group by 54.5%. Conclusion(s): The results of this pilot study suggest that remote titration facilitated by telemonitoring has the potential to increase the proportion of patients who achieve optimal doses of GDMT, decrease the time to dose optimization, and reduce the number of necessary clinic visits. These results have important implications for virtualization of care that are particularly relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 highlighted the need for alternate models of care. Our study suggests that remote titration can be successfully utilized to create an alternate care delivery model that combines virtual follow-ups with minimal clinic visits.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed life and work patterns and reshaped the healthcare industry and public health strategies. It posed considerable challenges to public health emergency operations centers (PHEOCs). In this period, digital technologies such as modeling, simulation, visualization, and mapping (MSVM) emerged as vital tools in these centers. Despite their perceived importance, the potential and adaptation of digital tools in PHEOCs remain underexplored. This study investigated the application of MSVM in the PHEOCs during the pandemic in Canada using a questionnaire survey. The results show that digital tools, particularly visualization and mapping, are frequently used in PHEOCs. However, critical gaps, including data management issues, technical and capacity issues, and limitations in the policy-making sphere, still hinder the effective use of these tools. Key areas identified in this study for future investigation include collaboration, interoperability, and various supports for information sharing and capacity building.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Objective To examine risk perceptions and behavioural responses of the UK adult population during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK. Design A cross-sectional survey. Setting Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants 2108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Response rate was 84.3% (2108/2500). Data collected between 17 March and 18 March 2020. Main outcome measures Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including number of respondents and weighted percentages. Robust Poisson regression used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) ability and (4) willingness to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1992 (94.2%) respondents reported at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 years compared with younger adults aged 18-34 years (adjusted relative risk/aRR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5). Those with lowest household income were three times less likely to be able to work from home (aRR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.45) and less likely to be able to self-isolate (aRR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aRR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.0). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions Ability to adopt and comply with certain non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socioeconomic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

   abstract = {Early in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a global public health concern requiring urgent attention, concerted efforts and intervention to avoid catastrophe. This necessitated optimal use of fast-emerging data to be analysed to draw out inferences that would shape our response. World Health Organisation (WHO) called this pandemic an infodemic where data played a crucial role. This paper reviews how data from varied sources and different types helped delay the outbreak, limit the spread, initiate social and public health measures, decide treatment regimes, optimise healthcare infrastructure and human resources and helped to initiate a multipronged strategy with emerging evidence for further course correction as the world progressed through the pandemic. The classical mathematical tools, i.e., Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and its variants, were the primary analytical techniques utilised to analyse such data. However, newer data analytical techniques utilising artificial intelligence and machine learning, were also extensively used. These techniques have the capability to handle large quantities of data and develop prediction models of various emerging situations that offer foreknowledge for policymakers and provide solutions. Data Science has witnessed a leap in the past few years, and the way it helped shape our response to this pandemic is a testimony to the promise that it holds for humankind.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although in the past, the decision to enter the nursing profession was mainly due to intrinsic motives, more recent generations present additional extrinsic career choice motives. The motivation of choosing a nursing career may be affected by global health events, such as COVID-19. PURPOSE: To examine the motivation for choosing a nursing career during COVID-19. METHOD(S): A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted among 211 first-year nursing students at a university in Israel. A questionnaire was distributed during 2020 and 2021. Linear regression evaluated the motives that predict choosing a nursing career during COVID-19. RESULT(S): Intrinsic motives were the leading motives for choosing a nursing career in a univariate analysis. A multivariate linear model revealed that choosing a nursing career during the pandemic was associated with extrinsic motives (beta= .265, P < .001). Intrinsic motives did not predict choosing a nursing career during COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): Reassessment of motives among candidates may help the efforts of faculty and nursing to recruit and retain nurses in the profession.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

   abstract = {Background: Community pharmacists are key partners to public health agencies during pandemics and other emergencies. Community pharmacy and public health agencies can establish memoranda of understanding (MOUs) for dispensing and administering medical countermeasures and providing related services to affected population(s) during a public health incident. Objective(s): The objective of this facilitated discussion exercise was to identify the strengths and opportunities associated with the activation of a statewide pharmacy-public health agencies MOU with community pharmacists on the basis of a simulated pandemic influenza event. Method(s): A facilitated discussion exercise was held in the Puget Sound region of the State of Washington in May 2017. The participants included pharmacists from 2 community pharmacy organizations, emergency preparedness officials from 2 local health departments and the state health department, staff of the state pharmacy association, and faculty from a school of pharmacy. The evaluators recorded the discussions and observations, augmented by a postexercise telephone call with participants from each of the participating community pharmacy organizations. Key themes from the exercise are reported. Result(s): Five themes were identified during the facilitated discussion exercise. Two themes described the strengths of the MOU and its operational plan: (1) collaboration strengthens preparedness and response planning, and (2) an MOU provides a framework for effective collaboration. Three themes acknowledged the opportunities to optimize activation of the existing MOU: (1) early and active engagement between health department personnel and community pharmacists, (2) establishing pharmacy policies and procedures to support readiness and response, and (3) addressing the training or other educational needs of community pharmacists. Conclusion(s): This exercise provided community pharmacists and public health agency personnel an opportunity to better plan for responding to a pandemic. The open dialogue in this facilitated discussion allowed the exercise participants to identify the strengths, priorities, and perspectives as well as the gaps in the MOU operational plan. The lessons learned in this exercise can inform the community pharmacy and public health response to the coronavirus disease pandemic.Copyright © 2021 American Pharmacists Association},

   abstract = {With the aim of studying the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Tuscany region of Italy during the first epidemic wave (February-June 2020), we define a compartmental model that accounts for both detected and undetected infections and assumes that only notified cases can die. We estimate the infection fatality rate, the case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number, modeled as a time-varying function, by calibrating on the cumulative daily number of observed deaths and notified infected, after fixing to plausible values the other model parameters to assure identifiability. The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve. This stresses the need of collecting information on these parameters to better understand the phenomenon and get reliable predictions.Copyright: © 2021 Baccini et al.

   title = {Determinants of Shielding Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations With Well-being Among National Health Service Patients: Longitudinal Observational Study},
   journal = {JMIR public health and surveillance},
   volume = {7},

   pages = {e30460},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The UK National Health Service (NHS) classified 2.2 million people as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, advising them to "shield" (to not leave home for any reason). OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study was to measure the determinants of shielding behavior and associations with well-being in a large NHS patient population for informing future health policy. METHOD(S): Patients contributing to an ongoing longitudinal participatory epidemiology study (Longitudinal Effects on Wellbeing of the COVID-19 Pandemic [LoC-19], n=42,924) received weekly email invitations to complete questionnaires (17-week shielding period starting April 9, 2020) within their NHS personal electronic health record. Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised. RESULT(S): The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded. CONCLUSION(S): Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios.Copyright ©Patrik Bachtiger, Alexander Adamson, William A Maclean, Mihir A Kelshiker, Jennifer K Quint, Nicholas S Peters.

   abstract = {Objectives: This study was conducted to assess the perceptions and the opinions of our anesthesia and critical care staff at King Abdulaziz University Hospital regarding the preparation strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: In this cross-sectional study, an electronic questionnaire was constructed using Google forms and sent to staff. The questionnaire included questions on the demographic information of the participants and the department's strategic plans, preparedness and protective measures taken to protect staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Result(s): A response rate of 71% was achieved. The results revealed that 75% of the participants felt that they were trained well enough to handle a positive or suspected COVID-19 patient. Stress levels increased during the initial COVID-19 outbreak then decreased after the department began providing COVID-19 educational activities (such as PPE courses and virtual Monday grand rounds) (p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between stress levels before and after the introduction of continuous medical education courses (SP = 0.68, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In crisis management plans, psychological pressure management includes the effective use of continuous medical education, periodic group meetings, and mental health wellbeing clinics. For confidence development among healthcare workers, clinical simulation drills can be a key management strategy.Copyright © 2021 Faculty of Anaesthesia, Pain and Intensive Care, AFMS.

   journal = {The Lancet},
   volume = {395},
   number = {10238},
   pages = {1715-1725},
   abstract = {Background: The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. Method(s): In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0.001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. Finding(s): We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50.7%] women and 1 904 077 [49.3%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13.7% were older than 70 years and 6.3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4.46% (95% CI 4.41-4.51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1.5, four with an RR of 2.0, and seven with an RR of 3.0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1.5, 36 749 with an RR of 2.0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3.0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1.5, 293 991 with an RR of 2.0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3.0. Interpretation(s): We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

   journal = {Journal of Medical Internet Research},
   volume = {26},
   number = {1},
   pages = {e45723},
   abstract = {Background: Responses to public health crises are increasingly technological in nature, as the prominence of COVID-19-related statistics and simulations amply demonstrates. However, the use of technologies is preconditional and has various implications. These implications can not only affect acceptance but also challenge the acceptability of these technologies with regard to the ethical and normative dimension. Objective(s): This study focuses on pandemic simulation models as algorithmic governance tools that played a central role in political decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess the social implications of pandemic simulation models, the premises of data collection, sorting, and evaluation must be disclosed and reflected upon. Consequently, the social construction principles of digital health technologies must be revealed and examined for their effects with regard to social, ethical, and ultimately political issues. Method(s): This case study starts with a systematization of different simulation approaches to create a typology of pandemic simulation models. On the basis of this, various properties, functions, and challenges of these simulation models are revealed and discussed in detail from a socioscientific point of view. Result(s): The typology of pandemic simulation methods reveals the diversity of model-driven handling of pandemic threats. However, it is reasonable to assume that the use of simulation models could increasingly shift toward agent-based or artificial intelligence models in the future, thus promoting the logic of algorithmic decision-making in response to public health crises. As algorithmic decision-making focuses more on predicting future dynamics than statistical practices of assessing pandemic events, this study discusses this development in detail, resulting in an operationalized overview of the key social and ethical issues related to pandemic crisis technologies. Conclusion(s): This study identifies 3 major recommendations for the future of pandemic crisis technologies.Copyright ©Gabriel Bartl.},

   abstract = {Importance: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative COVID-19 cohort to date. This multicenter data set can support robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and inform clinical care and policy., Objectives: To evaluate COVID-19 severity and risk factors over time and assess the use of machine learning to predict clinical severity., Design, Setting, and Participants: In a retrospective cohort study of 1926526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression., Results: The cohort included 174568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1133848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity., Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Limited evidence exists on the policies to increase self-isolation compliance, with no experimental evidence. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a home visiting intervention in the London Borough of Havering on compliance with self-isolation guidance, relative to positive COVID-19 cases who received no home visits. DESIGN: Mixed method evaluation involving a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an implementation and process evaluation. METHOD(S): A total of 3878 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 were randomly allocated with equal probability to receive home visits from Havering outreach team staff (n=1946) or to a control group (n=1932) who did not receive home visits. Randomization was implemented through a spreadsheet consisting of random numbers generated online that was used to randomly allocate cases to treatment and control. Check-in calls were conducted by a separate blinded contact tracing team on day six of isolation to measure successful self-isolation compliance. The primary intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted on 3860 cases as 18 patients were excluded from analysis because of the missing outcome data. For the implementation and process evaluation, qualitative, semi-structured, one-to-one interviews were conducted with trial participants in the treatment arm of the RCT (n=15) and stakeholders within the London Borough of Havering's Adult Social Care and Health Team (n=8). Qualitative data was analysed thematically using a framework approach. RESULT(S): Positive cases who were allocated to receive the home visiting intervention (n=1933) were more likely to report successful self-isolation compared to those allocated to the control group (n=1927), an effect that was statistically significant (odds ratio 1.204 [95% CI: 1.052, 1.377]; absolute probability difference: 4.1 percentage points [95% CI: 1.2-6.9]). The implementation and process evaluation found that a key driver of compliance was altruistic motivation based on its perceived importance for protecting the community with some participants also reporting the potential of being caught not complying as a driving factor. Participants also reported that the intervention helped them 'feel supported', provided them with information about practical and financial support, and clarified their understanding or increased their awareness of self-isolation and COVID-19 guidance. No harms were reported from this trial. The trial was registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN10030612. CONCLUSION(S): A home-visiting intervention conducted between January and March 2022 increased the self-isolation compliance of positive COVID-19 cases allocated to receive home visits. The implementation and process evaluation highlighted that the intervention increased individuals' motivation to comply with guidance, and addressed some barriers associated with opportunity and capability to comply. This trial provides much-needed evidence to inform the policy and intervention design to support public health and social measures in future outbreak scenarios.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {Introduction: Few healthy eating, school-based interventions have been rigorously evaluated in American Indian communities. Gardening and healthy eating are priorities in the Navajo Nation. Collaborations between researchers and local partners supported the design and implementation of this project., Design: The Yeego! Healthy Eating and Gardening Study was a group-randomized controlled trial to evaluate a school-based healthy eating and gardening intervention in 6 schools in the Navajo Nation. Schools were randomized 1:2 to intervention or comparison., Setting/participants: The Shiprock and Tsaile/Chinle areas in the Navajo Nation were selected. Elementary schools were screened for eligibility. All students in third and fourth grades were invited to participate in the assessments., Intervention: Delivered during 1 school year in the intervention schools, the intervention included a culturally relevant nutrition and gardening curriculum and a school garden., Main outcome measures: Student self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables, student self-efficacy for gardening, and student healthy foods score from a modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index were assessed in third and fourth graders at the beginning and end of a school year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary analyses used repeated measures linear mixed models accounting for students nested within schools to estimate the intervention effect and 95% CIs., Results: Students in the intervention schools had self-efficacy scores for eating fruits and vegetables that were 0.22 points greater (95% CI=0.04, 0.41) than those in the comparison schools, although the student healthy foods score increased in the intervention schools by 2.0 (95% CI=0.4, 3.6); the differential change was modest at 1.7 (95% CI=-0.3, 3.7). The self-efficacy to grow fruits and vegetables in the school garden increased among those in the intervention schools (OR=1.92; 95% CI=1.02, 3.63) but not significantly more than it increased in the comparison schools (OR=1.29; 95% CI=0.60, 2.81)., Conclusions: The intervention was efficacious in improving self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables among third- and fourth-grade students over a school year. The findings warrant further evaluation of the intervention in larger-group randomized trials with schools in Navajo communities., Trial registration: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT03778021.

   abstract = {Objectives To explore the indirect negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions (collateral damage) on the lives and health of older adults living in central Stockholm, and to characterise the sociodemographic profile of those with the highest susceptibility to this damage. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting District of Kungsholmen in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants Older adults aged 68 years and above (n=1231) who participated in the ad hoc COVID-19-related phone questionnaire administered by trained staff between May and June 2020 and who had previously attended the regular follow-up assessment of the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) during 2016-2019. Primary and secondary outcome measures Three dimensions of collateral damage: psychological burden (feelings of worry, stress and loneliness), reductions in social and physical activities, and reductions in medical and social care use since the beginning of the pandemic. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between age, sex, education and living arrangement, and the risk of collateral damage. Results Vast majority of participants adhered to the national public health recommendations, with over three-quarters practising self-isolation (n=928). Half of the sample reported psychological burden, 55.3% reported reductions in social or physical activity, and 11.3% reported decreased medical or social care use. Over three quarters of participants (77.8%) were affected by at least one of the three collateral damage dimensions. Female sex was the strongest sociodemographic predictor of both individual and co-occurring dimensions of collateral damage. Conclusions COVID-19 and its restrictions during the first half of 2020 had a negative effect on the health and lives of a majority of the elderly living in central Stockholm. Women were at a higher risk of these negative consequences. We emphasise the need for predefined, evidence-based interventions to support those who are most susceptible to these consequences, both during the pandemic and once the outbreak is overcome.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

   abstract = {Motivated by unique challenges faced in containing the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, we develop a framework to dynamically allocate limited resources to several possibly connected populations where the disease transmission is stochastic. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic program. However, as the state and action spaces grow exponentially with the size of the problem, the standard solution techniques do not apply. We propose two solution methodologies along with several benchmark policies. The first approach considers a dynamic one-step look-ahead policy which is equivalent to a nonlinear integer knapsack that scales well with the problem size. The second approach is a modification of a myopic incidence policy found in the literature. In addition to testing the proposed policies in a simulation setting of the optimization framework, we develop a large-scale stochastic simulation for 2014 Ebola outbreak in a case study. We calibrate and validate the stochastic simulation model with real-world data from Sierra Leone. Our results provide insights on efficient prioritization and resource allocation in this setting.Copyright © 2022 "IISE".},

   abstract = {Objectives Sexual harassment among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is a prevalent and understudied form of gender-based violence (GBV) with negative impacts on health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic raised global concern about GBV within homes; less is known about how it affected GBV in public spaces. Methods Present analyses use cross-sectional data from a cohort of adolescents and young adults residing in Nairobi, Kenya, restricted to female participants. Data were collected August-October 2020 via phone after implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. Prevalence of past-year sexual harassment and harassment relative to COVID-19 restrictions were calculated for overall sample, and by individual, household, and pandemic-related factors. Multivariate negative binomial regression models examine correlates of (1) past-year sexual harassment and (2) increases in sexual harassment relative to COVID-19 restrictions. Results Overall, 18.1% of AGYW experienced past-year sexual harassment at the 2020 survey. Among this group, 14.6% experienced sexual harassment pre-COVID-19 only, 18.8% after only and 66.6% at both time points. Among the latter group, 34.9% reported more occurrences following COVID-19 restrictions, 20.5% reported less occurrences and 44.7% reported no change in occurrence. Overall, 42.0% of AGYW experienced an increase in sexual harassment while 58.0% experienced no increase since COVID-19. In adjusted models, past-year sexual harassment was associated with higher educational attainment (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 2.11; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.52) and inability to meet basic financial needs (aRR 1.67; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.66). Increased sexual harassment since COVID-19 was associated with having full control to leave the home (aRR 1.69; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.90). Conclusions Sexual harassment among AGYW in Nairobi, Kenya was prevalent before and during COVID-19 restrictions. Safety in public spaces remains a highly gendered issue that impacts women's safety and ability to participate in public life. Prevention and support services to address sexual harassment remain an important element in ensuring safe, sustainable public spaces.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The viral main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro), known to control coronavirus replication and essential for viral life cycle, has been established as an essential drug discovery target for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employed computationally screening of Druglib database containing FDA approved drugs against active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using MTiopen screen web server, yields a total of 1051 FDA approved drugs with docking energy >-7 kcal/mol. The top 10 screened potential compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were then studied by re-docking, binding affinity, intermolecular interaction, and complex stability via 100 ns all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation followed by post-simulation analysis, including end point binding free energy, essential dynamics, and residual correlation analysis against native crystal structure ligand N3 inhibitor. Based on comparative molecular simulation and interaction profiling of the screened drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro revealed R428 (-10.5 kcal/mol), Teniposide (-9.8 kcal/mol), VS-5584 (-9.4 kcal/mol), and Setileuton (-8.5 kcal/mol) with stronger stability and affinity than other drugs and N3 inhibitor; and hence, these drugs are advocated for further validation using in vitro enzyme inhibition and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England., METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >=18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time., RESULTS: 17 282 905 adults were included, of whom 27 480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14 882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2.90 (95% CI 1.96-4.30; p<0.0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.74-3.84; p<0.0001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 4.31 (95% CI 2.42-7.65) versus 1.84 (1.03-3.26) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0.044)., INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves., FUNDING: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

   abstract = {Since 8th March 2020 up to the time of writing, we have been producing near real-time weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for all countries with evidence of sustained transmission, shared online. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. Here we present a retrospective evaluation of the forecasts produced between 8th March to 29th November 2020 for 81 countries. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts produced in real-time using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. During the 39-week period covered by this study, both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week ahead forecasts respectively. The retrospective evaluation of our models shows that simple transmission models calibrated using routine disease surveillance data can reliably capture the epidemic trajectory in multiple countries. The medium-term forecasts can be used in conjunction with the short-term forecasts of COVID-19 mortality as a useful planning tool as countries continue to relax public health measures.Copyright © 2023 Bhatia et al.

   pages = {666-675},
   abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Can we use prediction modelling to estimate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) related delay in starting IVF or ICSI in different groups of women?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Yes, using a combination of three different models we can predict the impact of delaying access to treatment by 6 and 12 months on the probability of conception leading to live birth in women of different age groups with different categories of infertility., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased age and duration of infertility can prejudice the chances of success following IVF, but couples with unexplained infertility have a chance of conceiving naturally without treatment whilst waiting for IVF. The worldwide suspension of IVF could lead to worse outcomes in couples awaiting treatment, but it is unclear to what extent this could affect individual couples based on age and cause of infertility., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population-based cohort study based on national data from all licensed clinics in the UK obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Register. Linked data from 9589 women who underwent their first IVF or ICSI treatment in 2017 and consented to the use of their data for research were used to predict livebirth., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Three prediction models were used to estimate the chances of livebirth associated with immediate treatment versus a delay of 6 and 12 months in couples about to embark on IVF or ICSI., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We estimated that a 6-month delay would reduce IVF livebirths by 0.4%, 2.4%, 5.6%, 9.5% and 11.8% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, while corresponding values associated with a delay of 12 months were 0.9%, 4.9%, 11.9%, 18.8% and 22.4%, respectively. In women with known causes of infertility, worst case (best case) predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years varied between 31.6% (35.0%), 29.0% (31.6%), 23.1% (25.2%), 17.2% (19.4%) and 10.3% (12.3%) for tubal infertility and 34.3% (39.2%), 31.6% (35.3%) 25.2% (28.5%) 18.3% (21.3%) and 11.3% (14.1%) for male factor infertility. The corresponding values in those treated immediately were 31.7%, 29.8%, 24.5%, 19.0% and 11.7% for tubal factor and 34.4%, 32.4%, 26.7%, 20.2% and 12.8% in male factor infertility. In women with unexplained infertility the predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle were 41.0%, 36.6%, 29.4%, 22.4% and 15.1% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, compared to 34.9%, 32.5%, 26.9%, 20.7% and 13.2% in similar groups of women treated without any delay. The additional waiting period, which provided more time for spontaneous conception, was predicted to increase the relative number of babies born by 17.5%, 12.6%, 9.1%, 8.4% and 13.8%, in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively. A 12-month delay showed a similar pattern in all subgroups., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Major sources of uncertainty include the use of prediction models generated in different populations and the need for a number of assumptions. Although the models are validated and the bases for the assumptions are robust, it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of imprecision in our predictions. Therefore, our predicted live birth rates need to be validated in prospective studies to confirm their accuracy., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in starting IVF reduces success rates in all couples. For the first time, we have shown that while this results in fewer babies in older women and those with a known cause of infertility, it has a less detrimental effect on couples with unexplained infertility, some of whom conceive naturally whilst waiting for treatment. Post-COVID 19, clinics planning a phased return to normal clinical services should prioritize older women and those with a known cause of infertility., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTER ST(S): No external funding was received for this study.

   abstract = {Background The first positive COVID-19 tests in the UK were in our Trust. We were fortunate that there was a significant time delay between the first identified cases and the surge in cases that was seen across the UK in early 2020. Our department had been designed for maximal ease of access to equipment but the pandemic required us to change our layout and pathways. Summary of Work Across our adult and paediatric emergency departments we used targeted simulation scenarios to train staff, to help in the design of new pathways and expose latent errors. A series of basic scenarios with a member of staff as a simulated patient were used to train existing and redeployed staff in basic skills such as donning/doffing, entering and exiting a barriered room and passing samples out of the room without cross-contamination. Another series of simulated patient scenarios were used to train clinicians in the clinical management of a COVID-19 patient with an escalating oxygen requirement. We also practiced transfer of a deteriorating patient to Resus. Other simulation scenarios used an intubatable manikin to practice scenarios involving aerosol generating procedures. ED intubation simulations contributed to the design of our Trust's COVID-19 intubation checklist. We ran simulated cardiac arrest scenarios in adult and paediatric Majors cubicles and in Resus. In situ simulations were used to design our new 'Cold Majors' area in what was our Emergency Care Area. We designed scenarios to test transfer pathways from the ambulance bay to the new area and from Cold Majors to X ray and CT. Summary of Results In all, more than 50 scenarios were run over a six week period. Orientation simulations ran most frequently and highlighted any lapses in infection control practices that could be addressed. Deteriorating patient, intubation, cardiac arrest and fitting patient scenarios highlighted latent errors around storage of equipment and preparation of airway trollies. They also directly informed the new layout of our resus cubicles and the ever-evolving departmental COVID-19 policies. In Cold Majors, they helped to plan the flow of patients within the new area and helped to orientate staff within the new environment. Discussion and Conclusions In situ simulation is an effective tool to help an emergency department adapt to the new demands placed on it by the COVID-19 pandemic; from maintaining standards in infection control to designing pathways and even the layout of the department itself.},

   abstract = {Background Significant concerns about mental health were raised during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among the participants of the United Arab Emirates Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS); a national cohort study. We further explored the change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data. Methods A sample of UAEHFS participants were invited to complete a COVID-19 online questionnaire during the first wave of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7) respectively. Unpaired analyses were done to examine the effect of COVID-19 on depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Paired analysis was conducted to examine the change in depression symptoms. Results During the pandemic, we reported a prevalence of 32.8% (95% CI: 27.0, 39.1) for depression and 26.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 32.6) for anxiety symptoms. Younger people reported higher levels of depression (40.4%) and anxiety (34.5%) symptoms. Females reported higher levels of depression (36.5%) and anxiety (32.7%) symptoms. In paired analysis, the prevalence of depression symptoms during the pandemic was 34% (95% CI: 26.5, 42.4) compared to 29.9% (95% CI: 22.7, 38.1) before the pandemic. No statistically significant difference was observed, p-value = 0.440. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression models for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 during the pandemic showed that participants, who were experiencing flu-like symptoms, had higher odds of reporting depression symptoms compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, age was significantly negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Overall, we found that depression and anxiety symptoms were more prevalent among young people and females. However, we did not find a significant change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data. Identifying vulnerable groups and understanding trajectories through longitudinal studies would help with planning for effective mental health interventions for the current and future pandemics.Copyright © 2022 Al Blooshi et al.},

   title = {Syndromic Surveillance Using Structured Telehealth Data: Case Study of the First Wave of COVID-19 in Brazil},
   journal = {JMIR public health and surveillance},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {e40036},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth has been widely used for new case detection and telemonitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. It safely provides access to health care services and expands assistance to remote, rural areas and underserved communities in situations of shortage of specialized health professionals. Qualified data are systematically collected by health care workers containing information on suspected cases and can be used as a proxy of disease spread for surveillance purposes. However, the use of this approach for syndromic surveillance has yet to be explored. Besides, the mathematical modeling of epidemics is a well-established field that has been successfully used for tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting the decision-making process on diverse aspects of public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The response of the current models depends on the quality of input data, particularly the transmission rate, initial conditions, and other parameters present in compartmental models. Telehealth systems may feed numerical models developed to model virus spread in a specific region. OBJECTIVE(S): Herein, we evaluated whether a high-quality data set obtained from a state-based telehealth service could be used to forecast the geographical spread of new cases of COVID-19 and to feed computational models of disease spread. METHOD(S): We analyzed structured data obtained from a statewide toll-free telehealth service during 4 months following the first notification of COVID-19 in the Bahia state, Brazil. Structured data were collected during teletriage by a health team of medical students supervised by physicians. Data were registered in a responsive web application for planning and surveillance purposes. The data set was designed to quickly identify users, city, residence neighborhood, date, sex, age, and COVID-19-like symptoms. We performed a temporal-spatial comparison of calls reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and notification of COVID-19 cases. The number of calls was used as a proxy of exposed individuals to feed a mathematical model called "susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased." RESULTS: For 181 (43%) out of 417 municipalities of Bahia, the first call to the telehealth service reporting COVID-19-like symptoms preceded the first notification of the disease. The calls preceded, on average, 30 days of the notification of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Additionally, data obtained by the telehealth service were used to effectively reproduce the spread of COVID-19 in Salvador, the capital of the state, using the "susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased" model to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of the disease. CONCLUSION(S): Data from telehealth services confer high effectiveness in anticipating new waves of COVID-19 and may help understand the epidemic dynamics.Copyright ©Viviane S Boaventura, Malu Grave, Thiago Cerqueira-Silva, Roberto Carreiro, Adelia Pinheiro, Alvaro Coutinho, Manoel Barral Netto.

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, national risk management scenarios took an unexpected course at different individual and collective scales. In France, in the field of occupational risk, long-established practices, rules, and categories have been disturbed and placed 'under stress'. The field of prevention of occupational risk, which has constituted a distinct field in health policies, with its own bodies, missions and approaches, was similarly disturbed. To describe and analyse these social phenomena, we propose using two complementary concepts: the British 'risk work' and the French 'prevention work' ['travail de prevention']. We show some of the empirical manifestations of risk work associated with prevention work and their effects on the boundaries instituted in the field of prevention at work. Our investigation used data from documentation and interviews in order to explore the experiences of two categories of professionals-physicians specialising in occupational health and home care aides-concerned with prevention during an acute phase of the pandemic. We point out that the question of protective means and equipment has been a central issue, in a context characterised by tensions between knowledge and available material resources. We also show that contradictions and points of tension between actors reveal the subjects under discussion and the more or less porous nature of the boundaries. Amid these processes, however, the principles underlying occupational health were reaffirmed, along with the need for a cooperation between workers and prevention professionals.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {Medical leaders have warned of the potential public health burden of a "parallel pandemic" faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals may have experienced scenarios in which their moral code was violated resulting in potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). In the present study, hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to examine the role of PMIEs on COVID-19 pandemic-related difficulties in psychosocial functioning among 211 healthcare providers (83% female, 89% White, and an average of 11.30 years in their healthcare profession [9.31]) over a 10-month span (May 2020 -March 2021). Reported exposure to PMIEs was associated with statistically significant poorer self-reported psychosocial functioning at baseline and over the course of 10-months of data collection. Within exploratory examinations of PMIE type, perceptions of transgressions by self or others (e.g., "I acted in ways that violated my own moral code or values"), but not perceived betrayal (e.g., "I feel betrayed by leaders who I once trusted"), was associated with poorer COVID-19 related psychosocial functioning (e.g., feeling connected to others, relationship with spouse or partner). Findings from this study speak to the importance of investing in intervention and prevention efforts to mitigate the consequences of exposure to PMIEs among healthcare providers. Interventions for healthcare providers targeting psychosocial functioning in the context of moral injury is an important area for future research.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

   journal = {Resources, Conservation and Recycling},
   volume = {188},
   pages = {106681},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic had large repercussions for our economy and organizations. Improved resilience can give organizations the ability to withstand crises and build back better and faster. This article assesses resilience of organizations and sole proprietorships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with eight circular strategies as explanatory variables. Furthermore, these eight circular strategies are also used to assess the organizations' and sole proprietorships' resilience outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis is conducted to explain how circular strategies can help companies and sole proprietorships maintain stability. The analysis was performed by means of a survey conducted between May and June 2020 in Flanders (Belgium), using a sample of 542 respondents. After performing a regression analysis combined with expert opinions collected through interviews, we find that companies and sole proprietorships with a higher circularity score have a significantly higher resilience score during crises and during normal times, compared to less circular companies. Furthermore, we find that the size of the company does not matter during a crisis to adapt and react flexibly, while it is important when there is no crisis. Finally, we argue that it is the combination of different circular strategies which yields to the highest results for the organizations' resilience and we provide policy recommendations based on the most asked support measures.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {This empirical study examines the factors enhancing environmental governance for marine plastic litter abatement in Manila, the Philippines. We use a combined covariance-based hybrid structural equation modeling (SEM) and DPSIR framework, with data collected via an online survey from 456 barangays in Manila, the Philippines. The survey was processed and analyzed using a combined model, validated through interviews and focused group discussions. With Higher-Order Model good internal consistency (0.917) and achieved measures of CFI (0.992), RMSEA (0.036), and SRMR (0.019), the findings revealed that environmental governance (COVID-19 waste), community participation, socio-economic factors, and solution measures have positively affected marine plastic litter (MPL) abatement. Notwithstanding, environmental governance (SWM policies and guidelines) has a negative impact on MPL abatement. There is, however, no link between waste infrastructure and MPL abatement. The findings provide significant perspectives in Manila to enhance environmental governance for MPL abatement. This paper presents policy-actions implications drawn from DPSIR-SEM.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A set of indicators and mathematical models are introduced that aim to quantitatively describe changes in crime levels in comparison to what could otherwise be expected, and what might be expected by way of adaptation and subsequent resumption of those patterns. The validity of the proposed resilience assessment tool is demonstrated using commercial theft data from the COVID-19 pandemic period. A 64 per cent reduction in crime was found in the studied city (China) during an 83-day period, before daily crime levels bounced back to higher than expected values. The proposed resilience indicators are recommended as benchmarking instruments for evaluating and comparing the global impact of COVID-19 policies on crime and public safety.Copyright: © 2020 Borrion et al.

   abstract = {Health care education programs were faced with the need to quickly adapt to a new reality during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Students were temporarily suspended from campus and clinical sites, requiring prompt changes in structure to their didactic and clinical learning. This article describes the rapid adjustments that one midwifery and women's health nurse practitioner education program created using both synchronous and asynchronous simulation experiences to promote student learning and ongoing engagement. Flexibility and reflexivity were needed by faculty and students alike in the face of the multiple changes wrought by the pandemic. Curricular changes were made simultaneously in many courses. Objective structured clinical examinations simulate telehealth experiences that assess knowledge, clinical reasoning, and professional behaviors via a scripted scenario and an actor patient. On-call simulations mimic telephone triage and provide students the opportunity to build listening, assessment, and management skills for prenatal and intrapartum scenarios. Students are provided equipment and virtual instruction in an intrauterine device insertion session, which promotes skill acquisition and self-confidence. Trigger films are used to visualize real-life or scripted clinical encounters, leading to discussion and decision-making, particularly in the affective domain. Bilateral learning tools, similar to case studies, provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking with a mechanism for faculty feedback. Web-based virtual clinical encounter learning tools using patient avatars prompt additional student learning. Suturing skills introduced in live remote group sessions are augmented with video-guided individual practice. This article describes each of these adapted and innovative simulation methods and shares lessons learned during their development and implementation.Copyright © 2021 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives},

   abstract = {This study aimed to compare worries related to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in families with young children in two regions in Germany differently affected by the pandemic (Regensburg in Southeast Germany, Leipzig in Eastern Germany) during the first and the second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. 720 parents participating in the KUNO Kids health study in Regensburg (n = 507) or the LIFE Child study in Leipzig (n = 213) answered questions regarding COVID-19-related worries and trust in anti-pandemic policy measures during the first wave (spring 2020) and during the second wave (winter 2020/2021) of the pandemic. Ordinal mixed-effects models were performed to assess differences depending on region and time, adjusting for education and migration background. Participants worried most about the general economic situation and their family and least about their own health or financial situation. Worries about oneself, family, friends, hometown, and country were stronger during the second than during the first wave. In regional comparisons, worries about family, friends, and hometown increased more pronouncedly from wave 1 to wave 2 in Leipzig (OR ranging from 2.67 (95% CI 1.71-4.19) to 3.01 (95% CI 1.93-4.71), all p < 0.001) than in Regensburg (OR ranging from to 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.78) to 1.72 (95% CI 1.33-2.21), all p < 0.05), running parallel with the increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Trust in anti-pandemic policy measures, in contrast, decreased significantly between wave 1 and wave 2, with a stronger decrease in Regensburg (OR = 0.30 (95% CI 0.22-0.39), p < 0.001) than in Leipzig (OR = 0.91 (95% CI 0.59-1.41), n.s.). The degree of families' COVID-19-related worries differs by region and time, which might be related to differences in infection rates and public interest. Regional differences should be taken into account when developing communication strategies and policy measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Study objective: We aim to describe the variability and identify gaps in preparedness and response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in European emergency departments (EDs) caring for children. Method(s): A cross-sectional point-prevalence survey was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (Paediatric Emergency Research in the United Kingdom and Ireland). We aimed to include 10 EDs for countries with greater than 20 million inhabitants and 5 EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was less than 5. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20 and 21 to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyze data. Result(s): Overall, 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on personal protective equipment (PPE) items was shown for recommended PPE use at pretriage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2 and N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative-pressure isolation rooms. Coronavirus disease 2019-positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Conclusion(s): We found variation and identified gaps in preparedness and response to the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. A lack in early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as gaps that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.Copyright © 2020 American College of Emergency Physicians},

   abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several epidemiological measures, such as cumulative case-counts (CCC), incidence rates, effective reproduction numbers (Reff) and doubling times, have been used to inform the general public and to justify interventions such as lockdown. It has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified during the course of the epidemic, which lead to incomplete case-detection. We compare CCC, incidence rates, Reff and doubling times in the presence of incomplete case-detection. For this, an infection-age-structured SIR model is used to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared in terms of relative errors. CCC is most prone to bias by incomplete case-detection in all of our settings. Reff is the least biased measure. The possibly biased CCC may lead to erroneous conclusions in cross-country comparisons. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend including and placing an emphasis on Reff in those epidemiological measures used for informing the general public and policy makers.Copyright © 2022 Brinks et al.

   abstract = {We derive a model in which firms operate in an epidemic environment and internalize infections among their employees in the workplace. The model is calibrated to fit the moments of the Covid-19 epidemic. We show that firms have incentives to fight against infections and can do so very effectively by increasing teleworking and rotating employees between on-site work, teleworking, and leave. The fight against infections in firms flattens the aggregate infections curve. Subsidies to teleworking reduce infections and save lives. Subsidies to sick leave reduce the cost of sick workers and raise workplace infections. Firms delay and weaken the fight against infections during economic downturns. We also consider the problem of a government that values output and lives. We show that the government prefers to severely restrict the epidemic by tolerating short-term output losses when it has a high valuation of life. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exposed the disproportionate effects of pandemics on frontline workers and the ethical imperative to provide effective prophylaxis. We present a model for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) that utilises Bayesian methods to rapidly determine the efficacy or futility of a prophylactic agent. Method(s): We initially planned to undertake a multicentre, phase III, parallel-group, open-label RCT, to determine if hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) taken once a week was effective in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in healthcare workers (HCW) aged >= 18 years in New Zealand (NZ) and Ireland. Participants were to be randomised 2:1 to either HCQ (800 mg stat then 400 mg weekly) or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was time to Nucleic Acid Amplification Test-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcome variables included mortality, hospitalisation, intensive care unit admissions and length of mechanical ventilation. The trial had no fixed sample size or duration of intervention. Bayesian adaptive analyses were planned to occur fortnightly, commencing with a weakly informative prior for the no prophylaxis group hazard rate and a moderately informative prior on the intervention log hazard ratio centred on 'no effect'. Stopping for expected success would be executed if the intervention had a greater than 0.975 posterior probability of reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by more than 10%. Final success would be declared if, after completion of 8 weeks of follow-up (reflecting the long half-life of HCQ), the prophylaxis had at least a 0.95 posterior probability of reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by more than 10%. Futility would be declared if HCQ was shown to have less than a 0.10 posterior probability of reducing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by more than 20%. Discussion(s): This study did not begin recruitment due to the marked reduction in COVID-19 cases in NZ and concerns regarding the efficacy and risks of HCQ treatment in COVID-19. Nonetheless, the model presented can be easily adapted for other potential prophylactic agents and pathogens, and pre-established collaborative models like this should be shared and incorporated into future pandemic preparedness planning. Trial registration: The decision not to proceed with the study was made before trial registration occurred.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We conducted an assessment in Malawi, Nepal, Niger, and Uganda to document access-related reasons for not using contraceptive methods during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to unintended pregnancies, describe use of modern contraception among women in potential need of contraception compared to before the pandemic, examine method choice, and describe barriers to contraceptive access and use. METHOD(S): Between December 2020 and May 2021, we conducted an opt-in phone survey with 21,692 women, followed by an outbound survey with 5,124 women who used modern nonpermanent contraceptive methods or who did not want to get pregnant within 2 years but were not using a modern contraceptive method. The surveys examined current behaviors and documented behaviors before the pandemic retrospectively. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors associated with contraceptive use dynamics during COVID-19. RESULT(S): Pregnant women surveyed reported that the pandemic had affected their ability to delay or avoid getting pregnant, ranging from 27% in Nepal to 44% in Uganda. The percentage of respondents to the outbound survey using modern contraception decreased during the pandemic in all countries except Niger. Fear of COVID-19 infection was associated with discontinuing modern contraception in Malawi and with not adopting a modern method among nonusers in Niger. Over 79% of surveyed users were using their preferred method. Among nonusers who tried obtaining a method, reasons for nonuse included unavailability of the preferred method or of providers and lack of money; nonusers who wanted a method but did not try to obtain one cited fear of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION(S): We found evidence of surveyed women attributing unintended pregnancies to the pandemic and examples of constraints to contraceptive access and use on the supply and demand side. The effects of the pandemic must be interpreted within the local contraceptive, health system, and epidemiological context.Copyright © Brunie et al.},

   journal = {JAMA Network Open},
   pages = {E227639},
   abstract = {Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted health care institutions worldwide to develop plans for allocation of scarce resources in crisis capacity settings. These plans frequently rely on rapid deployment of institutional triage teams that would be responsible for prioritizing patients to receive scarce resources; however, little is known about how these teams function or how to support team members participating in this unique task. Objective(s): To identify themes illuminating triage team members' perspectives and experiences pertaining to the triage process. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This qualitative study was conducted using inductive thematic analysis of observations of Washington state triage team simulations and semistructured interviews with participants during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 2020 to February 2021. Participants included clinician and ethicist triage team members. Data were analyzed from December 2020 through November 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Emergent themes describing the triage process and experience of triage team members. Result(s): Among 41 triage team members (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [11.4] years; 21 [51.2%] women) who participated in 12 simulations and 21 follow-up interviews, there were 5 Asian individuals (12.2%) and 35 White individuals (85.4%); most participants worked in urban hospital settings (32 individuals [78.0%]). Three interrelated themes emerged from qualitative analysis: (1) understanding the broader approach to resource allocation: Participants strove to understand operational and ethical foundations of the triage process, which was necessary to appreciate their team's specific role; (2) contending with uncertainty: Team members could find it difficult or feel irresponsible making consequential decisions based on limited clinical and contextual patient information, and they grappled with ethically ambiguous features of individual cases and of the triage process as a whole; and (3) transforming mindset: Participants struggled to disentangle narrow determinations about patients' likelihood of survival to discharge from implicit biases and other ethically relevant factors, such as quality of life. They cited the team's open deliberative process, as well as practice and personal experience with triage as important in helping to reshape their usual cognitive approach to align with this unique task. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that there were challenges in adapting clinical intuition and training to a distinctive role in the process of scarce resource allocation. These findings suggest that clinical experience, education in ethical and operational foundations of triage, and experiential training, such as triage simulations, may help prepare clinicians for this difficult role.Copyright © 2022 American Medical Association.

   pages = {e000854},
   abstract = {Objective This study aimed to explore the British public's healthcare-seeking beliefs concerning eye symptoms, and assess how the first COVID-19 lockdown influenced these. Methods and analysis An anonymous web-based survey was disseminated through mailing lists and social media between June and August 2020. The survey sought participants' views on the severity and urgency of the need for medical review for four ophthalmic and two general medical scenarios on a five-point scale. Participants were asked to answer questions twice: once ignoring the COVID-19 pandemic, and once taking this into account, with additional questions asked to identify factors influencing the decision to seek medical attention and ward admission. Results A total of 402 participants completed the survey (mean age 61.6 years, 63.1% female and 87.7% of white ethnicity). Scores for symptom severity and urgency of medical review increased significantly with the severity of the clinical scenario (both p<0.001). However, participants gave significantly lower scores for the urgency of medical attention when accounting for the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with no pandemic) for all scenarios (all p<0.001). Younger age, greater deprivation and non-white ethnicity were correlated with a lower perception of seriousness and urgency of medical attention. Conclusions During the first UK lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced urgency of medical review for ocular and systemic pathologies was reported in response to the pandemic, which represents a barrier to healthcare-seeking behaviour. This has the potential to critically delay medical review and timely management, negatively impacting patient outcomes.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors play a central role in seasonal epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain has shown a heterogeneous geographical pattern This study aimed to assess the influence of several climatic factors on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 among the Spanish Autonomous Communities (AA.CC.)., METHODS: Data on coronavirus infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease, as well as the climatic variables were obtained from official sources (Ministry of Health and Spanish Meteorological Agency, respectively). To assess the possible influence of climate on the development of the disease, data on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were collected during the months before the start of the pandemic. To analyze its influence on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, data on UVR, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the months of highest contagiousness to the peak of the pandemic., RESULTS: From October 2019 to January 2020, mean UVR was significantly related not only to SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence -previous 14 days- x 105 habitants, rho = - 0.0,666; p = 0.009), but also with COVID-19 severity, assessed as hospital admissions (rho = - 0.626; p = 0.017) and ICU admissions (rho = - 0.565; p = 0.035). Besides, temperature (February: rho = - 0.832; p < 0.001 and March: rho = - 0.904; p < 0.001), was the main climatic factor responsible for the infectivity of the coronavirus and directly contributed to a different spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the Spanish regions., CONCLUSIONS: Climatic factors may partially explain the differences in COVID-19 incidence and severity across the different Spanish regions. The knowledge of these factors could help to develop preventive and public health actions against upcoming outbreaks of the disease.},

   abstract = {HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (HIV-1 MTCT), is an important cause of children mortality worldwide. Brazil has been traditionally praised by its HIV/Aids program, which provides free-of-charge care for people living with HIV-1. Using public epidemiology and demographic databases, we aimed at modeling HIV-1 MTCT prevalence in Brazil through the years (1994-2016) and elaborate a statistical model for forecasting, contributing to HIV-1 epidemiologic surveillance and healthcare decision-making. We downloaded sets of live births and mothers' data alongside HIV-1 cases notification in children one year old or less. Through time series modeling, we estimated prevalence along the years in Brazil, and observed a remarkable decrease of HIV-1 MTCT between 1994 (10 cases per 100,000 live births) and 2016 (five cases per 100,000 live births), a reduction of 50%. Using our model, we elaborated a prognosis for each Brazilian state to help HIV-1 surveillance decision making, indicating which states are in theory in risk of experiencing a rise in HIV-1 MTCT prevalence. Ten states had good (37%), nine had mild (33%), and eight had poor prognostics (30%). Stratifying the prognostics by Brazilian region, we observed that the Northeast region had more states with poor prognosis, followed by North and Midwest, Southeast and South with one state of poor prognosis each. Brazil undoubtedly advanced in the fight against HIV-1 MTCT in the past two decades. We hope our model will help indicating where HIV-1 MTCT prevalence may rise in the future and support government decision makers regarding HIV-1 surveillance and prevention.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia},

This current study examined longitudinal effects of two cognitive vulnerabilities, looming cognitive style, and intolerance of uncertainty, as well as coping styles on anxiety and depression through online questionnaires at two time points in the pandemic, May 2020 (N = 1520) and August 2020 (N = 545). Depression, but not anxiety, significantly increased across time, which was moderated by coping style. Serial mediation modeling using path analysis demonstrated a significant pathway illustrating increased looming cognitive style in the beginning of the pandemic leads to increased intolerance of uncertainty, avoidant coping, and anxiety later in the pandemic. Results suggest a novel model in conceptualizing anxiety during the pandemic, namely highlighting looming cognitive style as an underlying cognitive vulnerability factor and antecedent of intolerance of uncertainty and illuminating the temporal directionality between looming cognitive style and intolerance of uncertainty. These findings provide important implications regarding intervention and public health messaging with modifiable behavioral and cognitive factors to improve mental health during a pandemic.

   abstract = {Introduction: The current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic and the constant increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods represent a threat to public health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of front-of-pack nutrition labelling, the trend of purchase and consumption of ultra-processed foods during social confinement by COVID-19 in the Peruvian population. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered online survey. A total of 330 participants between the ages of 18 and 59 were recruited from all regions of Peru. A validated questionnaire was used to assess the perception of front-of-food labelling, purchases, and consumption of ultra-processed foods. The data were analyzed using the statistical software IBM SPSS version 27, using the Chi-square test. A significance level of 5% was considered. Result(s): 77.9% and 68.7% showed a positive perception towards the implementation of the nutrient warning octagons and the label model/design, respectively. 63.3% agreed or totally agreed that octagons influence food purchases. The purchase of ultra-processed foods during confinement by COVID-19 occurred in 67.5% in women. Women were the ones who reported having read almost always or always in a higher proportion compared to men (31.5% vs. 23.3%). The largest proportion of participants reported an increase in the consumption of foods high in saturated fat (90%) and sugars (87%) during confinement. Conclusion(s): Participants had a positive perception towards the implementation of the nutrition warning labelling standard. However, both the purchase and consumption of ultra-processed foods were high. It is suggested that educational programs should be implemented to promote a gradual decrease in the consumption of ultra-processed foods during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021 Asociacion Espanola de Dietistas-Nutricionistas.

   journal = {SSM - Population Health},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {100348},
   abstract = {The theory of syndemics has been used to explain elevated HIV risk facing men who have sex with men (MSM). However, few studies have employed suitable analytical methods to test this theory. Using data from a probability-based sample of MSM in India, we tested three proposed models linking the co-occurring epidemics of violence victimisation, drug use, and frequent alcohol use to HIV risk: 1) the syndemic model of synergistically interacting epidemics; 2) the "chains of risk" model; and 3) the model of mutually causal epidemics. The primary outcome was inconsistent condom use with male or hijra (transgender women) partners in the past month. For the syndemic model, we included product terms between the exposures and assessed for interaction on the additive (linear probability regression) and multiplicative (logistic regression) scales. Path analysis was used to test the models of serially causal epidemics and mutually causal epidemics. Among 22,297 HIV-negative MSM, violence victimisation (24.7%), frequent alcohol use (27.5%), and drug use (10.9%) frequently co-occurred. We found evidence for a three-way interaction between violence victimisation, drug use and frequent alcohol use on both the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.28; 95% CI 0.10, 0.47) and additive (b = 0.14; 95% CI 0.01,.27) scales. We also estimated statistically significant two-way interactions between violence victimisation and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity =.10; 95% CI 0.008, 0.20) and additive (b = 0.05, 95% CI 0.002, 0.107) scales, and between drug use and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.24) and additive (b = 0.06, 95% CI 0.007, 0.129) scales. Thus, we found strong evidence for the syndemic model. The models of serially causal and mutually causal epidemics were partially supported. These findings highlight the need to sharpen how syndemic models are specified so that their empirical predictions can be adequately tested and distinguished from other theories of disease distribution.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although there is a significant increase of evidence regarding the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 on maternal and perinatal outcomes, data on the effects of the pandemic on the obstetric population in sub-Saharan African countries are still scarce. Therefore, the study aims were to assess the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes in the obstetric population at Central Hospital of Maputo (HCM), Mozambique., METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted at teaching and referral maternity, HCM, from 20 October 2020 to 22 July 2021. We collected maternal and perinatal outcomes up to 6 weeks postpartum of eligible women (pregnant and postpartum women-up to the 14th day postpartum) screened for COVID-19 (individual test for symptomatic participants and pool testing for asymptomatic). The primary outcome was maternal death, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. We estimated the COVID-19 prevalence and the unadjusted RR (95% CI) for maternal and perinatal outcomes. We used the chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare categorical variables (two-sided p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance)., RESULTS: We included 239 participants. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 was 9.2% (22/239) and in the symptomatic group was 32.4% (11/34). About 50% of the participants with COVID-19 were symptomatic. Moreover, the most frequent symptoms were dyspnoea (33.3%), cough (28.6%), anosmia (23.8%), and fever (19%). Not having a partner, being pregnant, and alcohol consumption were vulnerability factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (abortion, foetal death, preterm birth, Apgar, and NICU admission) was not significantly increased with COVID-19. Moreover, we did not observe a significant difference in the primary outcomes (SARS, ICU admission and maternal death) between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the obstetric population is higher than in the general population, and fifty percent of pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic. Not having a partner and alcohol consumption were factors of greatest vulnerability to SARS-COV-2 infection. Moreover, being pregnant versus postpartum was associated with increased vulnerability to COVID-19. Data suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 may have a higher frequency of COVID-19 infection, reinforcing the need for universal testing, adequate follow-up for this population, and increasing COVID-19 therapy facilities in Mozambique. Moreover, provide counselling during Antenatal care for COVID-19 preventive measures. However, more prospective and robust studies are needed to assess these findings. Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic of significant international concern, requiring decisive government actions with public understanding and subsequent adherence to control the spread. This study investigated the predictions of the public and healthcare workers (HCWs) at an early stage of the United Kingdom (UK) pandemic to assess their understanding of this novel virus and provide a reflection of the information readily available to them at the time., METHOD: A cross-sectional survey between the 18th and 20th March 2020 of UK adults was conducted via an anonymous 17-question online questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. Simple descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and unpaired Mann-Whitney t-tests investigated significance at the P<.05 levels., RESULTS: A total of 823 UK residents responded, of which 12.0% (n=99) were HCWs (doctors and nurses). The primary information sources used by our participants were BBC News, group messaging such as WhatsApp, and NHS England. The majority (38.9%) estimated government-enacted social restrictions would last two to four weeks. Mean best guess of total UK COVID-19 mortality was 1000 to 10,000 deaths, and the majority of participants (77.9%) revealed that they expected their day-to-day lives to be affected for less than six months in total. HCWs consistently estimated greater duration, scale, and impact of COVID-19 than non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs)., CONCLUSION: Survey respondents greatly underestimated the duration and impact of COVID-19 on their personal and public lives. Non-HCWs made greater underestimates than HCWs. This provides a historical reference and highlights a lack of clear information regarding the pandemic at the time of the survey. There is an ongoing need for effective, realistic, and timely communication between government, front-line clinicians, and the general public to manage expectations of the course of the pandemic and, consequently, increase adherence to public health measures.

   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {11},
   pages = {2100},
   abstract = {Italy is one of the first European epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. In attempts to hinder the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, Italian government hardened protective measures, from quarantine to lockdown, impacting millions of lives dramatically. Amongst the enacted restrictions, all non-essential activities were prohibited as well as all outdoor activities banned. However, at the first spur of the outbreak, for about a dozen of days, physical and sports activities were permitted, while maintaining social distancing. In this timeframe, by administering measures coming from self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior and anxiety state, in an integrated approach, we investigated the prevalence of these activities by testing, via a Structural Equation Model, the influence of such psychosocial variables on the intention to preserve physical fitness during the healthcare emergency. Through an adequate fit of the hypothesized model and a multi-group analysis, we compared the most COVID-19 hit Italian region - Lombardy - to the rest of Italy, finding that anxiety was significantly higher in the Lombardy region than the rest of the country. In addition, anxiety negatively influenced the intention to do physical activity. Giving the potential deleterious effects of physical inactivity due to personal restrictions, these data may increase preparedness of public health measures and attractiveness of recommendations, including on the beneficial effects of exercise, under circumstances of social distancing to control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease.

   abstract = {Intro: With the relentless waves of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), there is a need for widespread community adoption of infection prevention(IP) measures including hand hygiene, use of face masks, and staying at home when unwell. Understanding the profile of individuals who do not consistently practice IP can help target public health education. Method(s): We conducted a nationally-representative population survey from November 2020 to January 2021. Households were randomly selected from a proportionately stratified national census. The household member with the most recent birthday was invited to complete the survey. Three questions on a 5-point Likert-scale(never-rarely-occasionally-often-always) assessed IP behaviours(hand hygiene, face mask use when having a cough/cold, staying at home when having a cold/flu) before and during the pandemic. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to assess factors associated with the non- or inconsistent("never-rarely-occasionally") adoption of any of the three IP behaviours during the pandemic. Finding(s): Mean age of 2004 respondents was 44.5(SD 15.0) years, with 52% females and 65% being highly educated (diploma/degree holders). Although 12% reported consistently("often-always") adopting all 3 IP behaviours pre-pandemic, the majority(n=1752, 87%) reported doing so during the pandemic. After adjusting for age, educational level, and presence of chronic illness, males(AOR 1.71 [95%CI 1.30, 2.25], Chinese(AOR 1.48 [1.07, 2.05]), low-adopters of healthy lifestyle(AOR 1.59 [1.03, 2.45]) and those who did not or inconsistently adopted IP behaviours pre-pandemic(AOR 8.92 [3.28, 24.27]) were more likely not to or inconsistently adopt the 3 IP behaviours during the pandemic. Discussion(s): During the ongoing pandemic, educational messages and information channels on IP measures could be more targeted at males and Chinese. Additionally, the promotion of healthy lifestyle and consistent adoption of IP behaviours during non-pandemic times is critical for consistent adoption of IP behaviours during pandemics. Conclusion(s): Males, Chinese, and low-adopters of healthy lifestyle and IP behaviours pre-pandemic do not consistently practice IP during the pandemic.Copyright © 2023},

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort. SETTING: Secondary schools in New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Subsample of a cohort (n = 443) recruited in the first year of secondary school in 2010-11. Analysis data included three waves collected in September 2017-July 2018, September 2018-May 2019 and August 2019-January 2020), and in May-June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The primary predictors were time, gender and level of consumption prior to the pandemic. Outcome variables, analysed by mixed-effects models, included frequency and typical quantity of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, peak consumption, alcohol-related harm and drinking contexts. FINDINGS: Overall consumption (frequency x quantity) during the restrictions declined by 17% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.73, 0.95] compared to February 2020, and there was a 35% decline in the rate of alcohol-related harms in the same period (IRR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.79). Changes in alcohol consumption were largely consistent by gender. CONCLUSION(S): From a survey of secondary school students in Australia, there is evidence for a reduction in overall consumption and related harms during the COVID-19 restrictions.Copyright © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The suspension of elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has resulted in record volumes of patients waiting for operations. Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers., DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics., SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England., PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data., RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities., CONCLUSIONS: Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand.

   abstract = {Background: Covid-19 pandemic has been profoundly affecting people around the world. While contact restrictions, school closures and economic shutdown were effective to reduce infection rates, these measures go along with high stress for many individuals. Persons who have experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have an increased risk for mental health problems already under normal conditions. As ACEs can be associated with a higher vulnerability to stress we aimed to assess the role of ACEs on depressive symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method(s): In a cross-sectional online survey, 1399 participants above the age of 18 years were included during the first lockdown in Germany. Via two-way repeated measures ANOVA, differences in depressive symptoms before (retrospectively assessed) and during the pandemic were analyzed. Linear regression analyses were performed in order to identify predictors for increase of depressive symptoms. Result(s): Compared to prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms increased among all participants. Participants with ACEs and income loss reported about a stronger increase of depressive symptoms. Other predictors for increased depressive symptoms were young age and a lack of social support. Conclusion(s): Based on these results, ACEs are a significant predictor for an increase in depressive symptoms during the pandemic, indicating that personss with ACEs may be a risk group for mental health problems during the current and potential later pandemics. These findings underline the relevance of support for persons who have experienced ACEs and may help to provide more targeted support in possible scenarios due to the current or possible other pandemics. Besides, economic stability seems to be of prior importance for mental health.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Heart},
   volume = {108},
   number = {Supplement 1},

   abstract = {Introduction Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are a growing, heterogeneous group requiring lifelong follow-up to detect occurrence of known complications. In contrast to other cardiovascular disorders and chronic conditions, those with ACHD generally remain within the specialist tertiary hospital setting throughout their lives. The costs and burden on the patient of outpatient healthcare are increasingly recognised in the wider healthcare setting. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate present ambulatory healthcare in ACHD for ability to detect clinically relevant problems and consider patient and service provider costs. An additional aim was to define levels of non-attendance. We also summarise clinic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic when a hybrid approach of virtual and face to face consultations were arranged according to clinician perceived priority.Methods The clinic attendances of 100 patients attending the general ACHD clinic, selected by hospital number to minimise bias, were reviewed over a five-year period (1/01/2014-30/11/2019) and the Covid 19 period (23/03/2020-23/07/2021) by interrogation of the electronic patient record. This period represented 1/6 of their total lifetime clinic attendance. Results100 patients (Table 1) were invited to clinic annually. Non-attendance was 10% with 15 patients recurrently non-attending. 80% (459/ 575) of appointments resulted in no decision other than continued review (Figure 1). Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were performed frequently but new findings were rare (5.1% and 4.0%). Other investigations required separate attendance. Decision-making was more common with higher ACHD AP class and new symptoms. There were 25 elective admissions, and 40 emergency admissions over half following appointments where no notable findings were recorded (Figure 2). Distance travelled to the ACHD clinic, which was supported by six clinical staff, was 14.9km (range 1.6-265) resulting in an estimated 433-564 workdays lost. During Covid 19, 56% appointments were in-person; 41% telephone; 5% video. Decisions were made at 37% in-person and 19% virtual consultations. Non-attendance was 3.9% and there were 8 emergency admissions. Conclusion The primary purpose of ACHD ambulatory care is surveillance. Despite this, emergency hospital admissions exceed elective hospital admissions. There is a high burden of care for patient and healthcare provider with the traditional outpatient model. The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated provision of ambulatory care in a different way and should encourage development of a new more patient-centred approach to ambulatory care delivery in ACHD.},

   abstract = {Working in a hospital environment is known for presenting unhealthy features that affect the workers' health-features which have currently been intensified due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this longitudinal study aimed to ascertain the level of job stress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, how this changed, and its association with the dietary patterns of hospital workers. Data on sociodemographic, occupational, lifestyle, health, anthropometric, dietetic, and occupational stress were collected before and during the pandemic from 218 workers at a private hospital in the Reconcavo of Bahia, Brazil. McNemar's chi-square test was used for comparison purposes, Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify dietary patterns, and Generalized Estimating Equations to evaluate the interested associations. During the pandemic, participants reported increased occupational stress, shift work, and weekly workloads, compared with before the pandemic. Additionally, three dietary patterns were identified before and during the pandemic. No association was observed between changes in occupational stress and dietary pattens. However, COVID-19 infection was related to changes in pattern A (0.647, IC95%0.044;1.241, p = 0.036) and the amount of shift work related to changes in pattern B, (0.612, IC95%0.016;1.207, p = 0.044). These findings support calls to strengthen labour policies to ensure adequate working conditions for hospital workers in the pandemic context.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

This study aimed to describe risk factors for COVID-19 death in three referral hospitals located at 3399 m in Cusco, Peru, during the first 14 months of the pandemic. A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. A random sample of ~50% (1225/2674) of adult hospitalized patients who died between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021 was identified. Of those, 977 individuals met the definition of death by COVID-19. Demographic characteristics, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive respiratory support (IRS), disease severity, comorbidities, and clinical manifestation at hospital admission were assessed as risk factors using Cox proportional-hazard models. In multivariable models adjusted by age, sex, and pandemic periods, critical disease (vs. moderate) was associated with a greater risk of death (aHR: 1.27; 95%CI: 1.14-1.142), whereas ICU admission (aHR: 0.39; 95%CI: 0.27-0.56), IRS (aHR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.26-0.54), the ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index >= 5.3 (aHR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.80-0.94), and the ratio of SatO2/FiO2 >= 122.6 (aHR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93-0.98) were associated with a lower risk of death. The risk factors described here may be useful in assisting decision making and resource allocation.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   journal = {Neuromodulation},
   volume = {25},
   number = {7 Supplement},
   pages = {S190},
   abstract = {Introduction: On December 31, 2019, it was reported an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS) in Wuhan, China. The disease spread rapidly to different countries and continents and, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the practice of Neuromodulation in Latin America. Materials / Methods: A survey was sent to Latin American neuromodulators from July 19 to August 20, 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on the professional and personal level were determined. All variables were compared and analyzed. Result(s): Ninety four medical practitioners answered the complete survey from Brazil (48.9%), Argentina (25.5%), Mexico (7.4%), Chile (4.2%), Colombia (4.2%), Bolivia (3.1%), Ecuador (3.1%). and Uruguay (3.1%). Most of them were male (87.2%), in the 40-49 year age group (35.1%), with 15 or more years of experience (53.1%). Neurosurgeons were predominant (92.5%), DBS being the predominant practice (26.7%). A vast majority reported a decrease in surgical practices (98.9%), between 50 and 74% of them (38.2%), with the patient's decision being the most cited reason (37.2%), and DBS the most affected surgical technique (58.5%). 89.3% of those interviewed stated that the patients had been harmed, and that economic income decreased 25 to 100% in 84.05% of practitioners. At a personal level, 14.8% of respondents suffered from COVID-19, with moderate symptoms (71.4%). In addition, 48.9% suffered physical manifestations, as consequences of sedentary lifestyle (73.3%), and 40.42% reported psychological sequelae, with 80% of them with anxiety. Discussion(s): In Latin America, as in other regions of the world, as well as in other medical specialties, the current pandemic has had a negative impact. Moreover, before the pandemic, access to these therapies was already difficult due to cost. If we consider that these types of procedures are not a priority during the pandemic, the negative effects have multiplied. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 Pandemic has had a great impact among Latin American Neuromodulators, both at the professional level, with a significant decrease in the number of surgical practices and economic income, and at the personal level with physical and psychological manifestations that must be considered and controlled in the long term, to take measures to return to the level in which we were before the Pandemic. We must learn to take urgent preventive measures before potential new pandemic scenarios that are as severe as or more severe than the current one. Learning Objectives: 1- To know the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on Latin American Neuromodulation practitioners, both at a personal and emotional level. 2- To know the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the socioeconomic level. 3- To alert the community to take preventive measures against new pandemics to come.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and national responses to mitigate this public health threat have disrupted activities of daily living with economic and health impacts globally. The extent of these disruptions is evolving. Our objectives were to characterize participants who missed study visits during the pandemic and assess the impact of COVID-19 on HIV outcomes, employment, food security and trauma among people living with HIV (PLWH). Method(s): AFRICOS began enrolling adults at risk for HIV and PLWH at 12 PEPFAR-supported clinics in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria in 2013. At 6-monthly visits sociodemographic questionnaires were administered and clinical outcomes assessed. Chi-squared tests were used to describe differences between those presenting for and missing a study visit since the pandemic began, using data from participants' most recent visit before 19 March 2020. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing social and clinical indicators before and during the pandemic. Models were adjusted for age, sex and site; food security models were also adjusted for employment status. Analyses were restricted to those with a pre-COVID-19 visit on or after 1 January 2019 and at least one visit during the pandemic. Result(s): As of 1 November 2020, 1023 (44.5%) of 2298 PLWH with a pre- COVID-19 visit since 1 January 2019 had a visit during the pandemic. PLWH who missed a study visit during COVID-19 were less adherent to antiretroviral therapy (ART) (70.0% vs 88.6%, p<0.001), less adherent to clinic visits (77.5% vs 95.4%, p<0.001) and a greater proportion had a viral load >=1000 copies/mL on ART (17.5% vs 4.6%, p<0.001). Participants seen during the pandemic were less likely to be food secure (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.74) and more likely to have cut/reduced one or more meals per day (aOR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.36 - 2.25; table). No significant impacts of COVID-19 were observed on clinic visit or ART adherence, employment, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Among 665 PLWH with available data, 597 (89.8%) had a >=3-month supply of ART during COVID- 19. Conclusion(s): PLWH missing study visits during COVID-19 were less engaged in care prior to the pandemic. Innovations such as multi-month dispensing, telemedicine, and other differentiated service delivery strategies should be used to retain PLWH in care. During the pandemic, HIV outcomes remained stable, but food insecurity needs to be addressed.},

   abstract = {(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to investigate how moral reasoning is influenced by individuals' exposure to a crisis and by personal, societal and temporal proximity. We examined how Italians and Germans judged different behaviors that arose because of the pandemic, which affected health and societal matters. (2) Methods: Over the course of four months and three assessment periods, we used an observational online survey to assess participants' judgments regarding seven scenarios that addressed distributive shortages during the pandemic. (3) Results: Overall, there was no clear answering pattern across all scenarios. For a variation of triage and pandemic restrictions, most participants selected a mean value, which can be interpreted as deferring the choice. For the other scenarios, most participants used the extremes of the scale, thereby reflecting a clear opinion of the public regarding the moral issue. In addition, moral reasoning varied across the two countries, assessment periods, fear, and age. (4) Conclusion(s): By using scenarios that were taken from real-life experiences, the current study addresses criticism that moral research mostly relies on unrealistic scenarios that lack in external validity, plausibility, and proximity to everyday situations. In addition, it shows how lay people regard measures of public health and societal decision-making.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Rationale: The role of and needs for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at a population level during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have not been completely established. Objective(s): To identify the cumulative incidence of ECMO use in the first pandemic wave and to describe the Nationwide Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We conducted a population-based study from March 3 to August 31, 2020, using linked data from national agencies. The cumulative incidence of ECMO use and mortality risk of ECMOsupported patients were calculated and age standardized. In addition, a retrospective cohort analysis was performed. Outcomes were 90-day mortality after ECMO initiation, ECMO-associated complications, and hospital length of stay. Cox regression models were used to explore risk factors for mortality in a time-to-event analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 were supported with ECMO (0.42 per population of 100,000, 14.89 per 100,000 positive cases, and 1.2% of intubated patients with COVID-19); 85 were included in the cohort analysis, and the median age was 48 (interquartile range [IQR], 41-55) years, 83.5% were men, and 42.4% had obesity. The median number of pre-ECMO intubation days was 4 (IQR, 2-7), the median PaO2/FIO2ratio was 86.8 (IQR, 64-99) mm Hg, 91.8% of patients were prone positioned, and 14 patients had refractory respiratory acidosis. Main complications were infections (70.6%), bleeding (38.8%), and thromboembolism (22.4%); 52 patients were discharged home, and 33 died. The hospital length of stay was a median of 50 (IQR, 24-69) days. Lower respiratory system compliance and higher driving pressure before ECMO initiation were associated with increased mortality. A duration of pre-ECMO intubation >=10 days was not associated with mortality. Conclusion(s): Documenting nationwide ECMO needs may help in planning ECMOprovision for future COVID-19 pandemic waves. The 90-day mortality of the Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 (38.8%) is comparable to that of previous reports.Copyright © 2021 American Thoracic Society.

Revealing the characteristics and epidemic trends are important parts of disease control. The biological scenarios including transmission characteristics can be constructed and translated into mathematical models, which can help to predict and gain a deeper understanding of diseases. Areas covered: This review discusses the models for infectious diseases and highlights their values in the field of public health. This information will be of interest to mathematicians and clinicians, and make a significant contribution toward the development of more specific and effective models. Literature searches were performed using the online database of PubMed (inception to August 2020). Expert opinion: Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases. With the development of theories and the ability of calculations, infectious disease modeling would play a much more important role in disease prevention and control of public health.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic was intricately linked with contact between people, but many of the policies designed to encourage safe contact behaviors were unsuccessful. One reason was that the determinants of social contact decisions have not been thoroughly investigated using scientifically sound methodologies. To fill this gap, a unique survey was designed which sought data on social contact behaviors and their determinants. Second, a copula-based behavior model was developed to jointly represent the choices of contact modes (including direct and indirect contact) and the number of contacted persons. The survey was conducted in six countries from March to May 2021 and collected valid responses from >7000 people. A comparison of five key copula functions found that the Frank function outperformed the others. The results of a Frank-based model showed that indirect contacts were significantly and positively associated with the number of contacted persons. Then the influence of various determinants, including activity attributes (e.g., frequency and travel distance), protective measures, safety level of activity settings, and psychological factors related to activity participation and risk perception, were extensively analyzed. In particular, the various heterogeneous influences in different social contact settings were examined. The findings provide scientific evidence for policymakers to promote safe social distancing, even for the post-pandemic era.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To examine nursing students' stress and coping with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through an ecological model of resilience. Specifically, to examine the relative contribution of different resilience levels in decreasing nursing students' strain symptoms: at the individual level, resilience trait; at the relational level, students' coping strategies; at the university level, nursing students' perceptions on their university's readiness to handle the virus outbreak; and at the national level, nursing students' trust in policymakers' decisions. DESIGN: The study used a cross-sectional design. METHOD(S): Undergraduate students of five universities were recruited via an electronic link sent to their emails during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak: May-July 2020. Of them, 492 participants completed the research questionnaire. RESULT(S): Hierarchical Regression Analysis revealed that nursing students' resilience, as a multi-level factor, decreased the students' level of strain symptoms above and beyond their stress levels and control variables. Specifically, the nursing students' trait resilience, perceptions of their university's positive response to the pandemic and trust in their national policymakers were negatively associated with their strain symptoms. Conversely, disengagement-in-emotion coping strategies was positively associated with the students' strain symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): Nursing students' resilience should be seen as a flexible resource that can be developed and influenced by their academic and clinical training, and by the intentions and actions of their university and the nursing administration at the Ministry of Health (MOH). IMPACT: The findings call for the nursing administration at the MOH and for the university deans and department heads to prepare in advance a crisis plan that could be rapidly and effectively implemented when needed. Furthermore, topics such as developing flexible coping strategies should be integrated into the nursing curricula. These would allow students to prepare and cope better with adversity in their routine and in times of crisis.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Hong Kong has implemented stringent public health and social measures (PHSMs) to curb each of the four COVID-19 epidemic waves since January 2020. The third wave between July and September 2020 was brought under control within 2 m, while the fourth wave starting from the end of October 2020 has taken longer to bring under control and lasted at least 5 mo. Here, we report the pandemic fatigue as one of the potential reasons for the reduced impact of PHSMs on transmission in the fourth wave. We contacted either 500 or 1, 000 local residents through weekly random-digit dialing of landlines and mobile telephones from May 2020 to February 2021. We analyze the epidemiological impact of pandemic fatigue by using the large and detailed cross-sectional telephone surveys to quantify risk perception and self-reported protective behaviors and mathematical models to incorporate population protective behaviors. Our retrospective prediction suggests that an increase of 100 daily new reported cases would lead to 6.60% (95% CI: 4.03, 9.17) more people worrying about being infected, increase 3.77% (95% CI: 2.46, 5.09) more people to avoid social gatherings, and reduce the weekly mean reproduction number by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.44). Accordingly, the fourth wave would have been 14% (95% CI%: -53%, 81%) smaller if not for pandemic fatigue. This indicates the important role of mitigating pandemic fatigue in maintaining population protective behaviors for controlling COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

   abstract = {Background: Smartphone addiction has emerged as a major concern among children and adolescents over the past few decades and may be heightened by the outbreak of COVID-19, posing a threat to their physical and mental health. Then we aimed to develop a decision tree model as a screening tool for unrecognized smartphone addiction by conducting large sample investigation in mainland China. Method(s): The data from cross-sectional investigation of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents in mainland China (n = 3,615) was used to build models of smartphone addiction by employing logistic regression, visualized nomogram, and decision tree analysis. Result(s): Smartphone addiction was found in 849 (23.5%) of the 3,615 respondents. According to the results of logistic regression, nomogram, and decision tree analyses, Internet addiction, hours spend on smartphone during the epidemic, levels of clinical anxiety symptoms, fear of physical injury, and sex were used in predictive model of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents. The C-index of the final adjusted model of logistic regression was 0.804. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUC area of decision tree for detecting smartphone addiction were 87.3, 71.4, 92.1, 73.5, 91.4, and 0.884, respectively. Conclusion(s): It was found that the incidence of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents is significant during the epidemic. The decision tree model can be used to screen smartphone addiction among them. Findings of the five risk factors will help researchers and parents assess the risk of smartphone addiction quickly and easily.© Copyright © 2021 Duan, He, Li, Dai, Zhou, Lai and Zhu.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world in early 2020. In France, General Practitioners (GPs) were not involved in the care organization's decision-making process before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This omission could have generated stress for GPs. We aimed first to estimate the self-perception of stress as defined by the 10-item Perceived Stress Score (PSS-10), at the beginning of the pandemic in France, among GPs from the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, a french administrative area severely impacted by COVID-19. Second, we aimed to identify factors associated with a self-perceived stress (PSS-10>=27) among socio-demographic characteristics of GPs, their access to reliable information and to personal protective equipment during the pandemic, and their exposure to well established psychosocial risk at work. METHOD(S): We conducted an online cross-sectional survey between 8th April and 10th May 2020. The self-perception of stress was evaluated using the PSS-10, so to see the proportion of "not stressed" (<=20), "borderline" (21<=PSS-10<=26), and "stressed" (>=27) GPs. The agreement to 31 positive assertions related to possible sources of stress identified by the scientific study committee was measured using a 10-point numeric scale. In complete cases, factors associated with stress (PSS-10>=27) were investigated using logistic regression, adjusted on gender, age and practice location. A supplementary analysis of the verbatims was made. RESULT(S): Overall, 898 individual answers were collected, of which 879 were complete. A total of 437 GPs (49%) were stressed (PSS-10>=27), and 283 GPs (32%) had a very high level of stress (PSS-10>=30). Self-perceived stress was associated with multiple components, and involved classic psychosocial risk factors such as emotional requirements. However, in this context of health crisis, the primary source of stress was the diversity and quantity of information from diverse sources (614 GPs (69%, OR=2.21, 95%CI [1.40-3.50], p<0.001). Analysis of verbatims revealed that GPs felt isolated in a hospital-based model. CONCLUSION(S): The first wave of the pandemic was a source of stress for GPs. The diversity and quantity of information received from the health authorities were among the main sources of stress.},

   abstract = {Background: Although the US government approved hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) for hospitalized coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients, some studies denied efficacy of HCQ and CQ. We aimed to evaluate HCQ/CQ treatment for COVID-19. Method(s): Five databases were searched on April 15, 2020, without publication date restriction. We followed both Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement reporting recommendations. A random-model meta-analysis was conducted to pool odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR). The quality of evidence for each outcome and the final recommendation was assessed using the GRADE guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. Result(s): We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational studies with 2,063 COVID-19 cases. All-cause mortality was not affected by the administration of HCQ/CQ [OR: 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-2.09, P=0.89]. No improvement of viral clearance was found neither by time-to-event analysis (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.74-1.94, P=0.47) nor frequency on day 7 (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.33- 6.63, P=0.62). HCQ/CQ treatment increased the risk of the any adverse event with OR of 3.56 (95% CI: 1.62-7.83, P=0.002). Conclusion(s): HCQ/CQ failed to decrease the all-cause mortality (very low quality evidence) and did not improve viral clearance (low or very low quality evidence) but increased the risk of any adverse event (moderate quality evidence). Routine administration of HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 patients is not recommended (weak recommendation, Grade 2C).Copyright © 2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease.},

   abstract = {Background: Accurately assessing the regional activity of diseases such as COVID-19 is important in guiding public health interventions. Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word "cough" was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years. Method(s): A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. Result(s): The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word "cough" to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. Conclusion(s): A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.Copyright © Joann G Elmore, Pin-Chieh Wang, Kathleen F Kerr, David L Schriger, Douglas E Morrison, Ron Brookmeyer, Michael A Pfeffer, Thomas H Payne, Judith S Currier.

   pages = {e0256495},
   abstract = {Social distancing measures implemented by governments worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic have proven an effective intervention to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people's accounts on their behaviours in a sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (May 1-31, 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (August 5 -September 21, 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken.681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual's control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was reported by interviewees as, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, environmental constraints, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence was statistically associated with and reported as lack of trust in Government, support from friends, and lack of knowledge about rules. In addition, interviewees reported individual risk assessment and decision making on the extent to following the rules, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area. Our findings indicate that unintentional and intentional non-adherence should be improved by Government partnerships with local communities to build trust in social distancing measures; tailored messaging to young adults emphasising the need of protecting others whilst clarifying the risk of transmission; and ensuring COVID-secured environments by working with environmental health officers.},

   abstract = {Background/Purpose: This presentation is a brief overview of the experience at Miami Miller School of Medicine Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) in developing a patient-centered hybrid-model of care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We conducted a review of telehealth applications and interviews with psycho-oncology staff at Miami Miller School of Medicine Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Result(s): As the COVID-19 pandemic posed pervasive challenges for the provision of healthcare services, hospital systems and consult services rapidly adapted and improvised alternatives to traditional in-person consultation in order to minimize risks for iatrogenic transmission. At the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, our psycho-oncology service adapted its modalities of care delivery in a manner that continued to meet the ongoing clinical demands while minimizing risks for COVID-19 exposure for both patients and staff. During the initial phase, as COVID-19 cases began to proliferate in South Florida, consultations were abruptly shifted from in-person to telepsychiatry due to the scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following a thorough chart review, the hospital operator connected the psychiatrist to the patient's hospital room and the initial interview was conducted using the landline phone. This was followed by having the unit nursing staff assist in connecting the patient briefly to the psychiatrist via smartphone to facilitate visual observation. At a later stage, once PPE was readily available, our team continued the process of gathering information via phone, followed by brief in-person evaluation in full PPE. Patients were also seen in the COVID units, usually for the evaluation of delirium. This hybrid telepsychiatry/in-person consultation model successfully maintained continuity of services in the midst of the pandemic, even as COVID-19 surged dramatically in South Florida throughout summer 2020. This model safely maintained psychiatric consultations for cancer patients and accommodated patient preferences. Conclusions and Implications: The hybrid telepsychiatry/in-person consultation model successfully maintained continuity of services in the midst of the pandemic, even as COVID-19 surged dramatically in South Florida throughout summer 2020. This model safely maintained psychiatric consultations for cancer patients and accommodated patient preferences.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated spread of COVID-19, many jurisdictions around the world imposed mandatory or recommended social or physical distancing. As a result, at the beginning of the pandemic, various communication materials appeared online to promote distancing. Explanations of the science underlying these mandates or recommendations were either highly technical or highly simplified., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the effects of a dynamic visualization on distancing. Our overall aim was to help people understand the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in their community and the implications of their own behavior for themselves, those around them, the health care system, and society., METHODS: Using Scrum, which is an agile framework; JavaScript (Vue.js framework); and code already developed for risk communication in another context of infectious disease transmission, we rapidly developed a new personalized web application. In our application, people make avatars that represent themselves and the people around them. These avatars are integrated into a 3-minute animation illustrating an epidemiological model for COVID-19 transmission, showing the differences in transmission with and without distancing. During the animation, the narration explains the science of how distancing reduces the transmission of COVID-19 in plain language in English or French. The application offers full captions to complement the narration and a descriptive transcript for people using screen readers. We used Google Analytics to collect standard usage statistics. A brief, anonymous, optional survey also collected self-reported distancing behaviors and intentions in the previous and coming weeks, respectively. We launched and disseminated the application on Twitter and Facebook on April 8, 2020, and April 9, 2020., RESULTS: After 26 days, the application received 3588 unique hits from 82 countries. The optional survey at the end of the application collected 182 responses. Among this small subsample of users, survey respondents were nearly (170/177, 96%) already practicing distancing and indicated that they intended to practice distancing in the coming week (172/177, 97.2%). Among the small minority of people (n=7) who indicated that they had not been previously practicing distancing, 2 (29%) reported that they would practice distancing in the week to come., CONCLUSIONS: We developed a web application to help people understand the relationship between individual-level behavior and population-level effects in the context of an infectious disease spread. This study also demonstrates how agile development can be used to quickly create personalized risk messages for public health issues like a pandemic. The nonrandomized design of this rapid study prevents us from concluding the application's effectiveness; however, results thus far suggest that avatar-based visualizations may help people understand their role in infectious disease transmission.

   abstract = {In 2015, the 2030 Agenda was formally adopted by the United Nations, establishing a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 3 seeks to promote Global Health and the quality of public health systems in developing countries. The achievement of these goals requires the commitment of all signing countries, but the COVID-19 crisis is changing the behavior of the main stakeholders in the international arena. What do the experts think about these changes? Could these changes threaten the 2030 Agenda and Global Health? To answer these questions, we conduct a content analysis of 152 documents written by experts from the 15 main think tanks on international development policy. The results point out that the new scenario brought about by the pandemic is hindering the necessary cooperation between countries to achieve global health goals and to guarantee public health coverage in developing countries. To deal with these challenges, more delegation of powers to international organizations and a reform of the international cooperation system are needed. With this analysis, we launch a warning about potential weaknesses of the institutional design of the 2030 Agenda in order for it to survive in a post-COVID-19 world and remain a valid instrument to promote health worldwide.},

   journal = {Frontiers in Psychiatry},
   volume = {13},
   pages = {1045325},
   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is commonly believed to have increased common mental disorders (CMD, i.e., depression and anxiety), either directly due to COVID-19 contractions (death of near ones or residual conditions), or indirectly by increasing stress, economic uncertainty, and disruptions in daily life resulting from containment measure. Whereas studies reporting on initial changes in self-reported data frequently have reported increases in CMD, pandemic related changes in CMD related to primary care utilization are less well known. Analyzing time series of routinely and continuously sampled primary healthcare data from Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, and Latvia, we aimed to characterize the impact of the pandemic on CMD recorded prevalence in primary care. Furthermore, by relating these changes to country specific time-trajectories of two classes of containment measures, we evaluated the differential impact of containment strategies on CMD rates. Specifically, we wanted to test whether school restrictions would preferentially affect age groups corresponding to those of school children or their parents. Method(s): For the four investigated countries, we collected time-series of monthly counts of unique CMD patients in primary healthcare from the year 2015 (or 2017) until 2021. Using pre-pandemic timepoints to train seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, we predicted healthcare utilization during the pandemic. Discrepancies between observed and expected time series were quantified to infer pandemic related changes. To evaluate the effects of COVID-19 measures on CMD related primary care utilization, the predicted time series were related to country specific time series of levels of social distancing and school restrictions. Result(s): In all countries except Latvia there was an initial (April 2020) decrease in CMD care prevalence, where largest drops were found in Sweden (Prevalence Ratio, PR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.81-0.90), followed by Netherlands (0.86; 95% CI 0.76-1.02) and Norway (0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.98). Latvia on the other hand experienced increased rates (1.25; 95% CI 1.08-1.49). Whereas PRs in Norway and Netherlands normalized during the latter half of 2020, PRs stayed low in Sweden and elevated in Latvia. The overall changes in PR during the pandemic year 2020 was significantly changed only for Sweden (0.91; 95% CI 0.90-0.93) and Latvia (1.20; 95% CI 1.14-1.26). Overall, the relationship between containment measures and CMD care prevalence were weak and non-significant. In particular, we could not observe any relationship of school restriction to CMD care prevalence for the age groups best corresponding to school children or their parents. Conclusion(s): Common mental disorders prevalence in primary care decreased during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries except from Latvia, but normalized in Norway and Netherlands by the latter half of 2020. The onset of the pandemic and the containment strategies were highly correlated within each country, limiting strong conclusions on whether restriction policy had any effects on mental health. Specifically, we found no evidence of associations between school restrictions and CMD care prevalence. Overall, current results lend no support to the common belief that the pandemic severely impacted the mental health of the general population as indicated by healthcare utilization, apart from in Latvia. However, since healthcare utilization is affected by multiple factors in addition to actual need, future studies should combine complementary types of data to better understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.Copyright © 2023 Flodin, Sorberg Wallin, Tarantino, Cerchiello, Mlada, Kuklova, Kondratova, Parimbelli, Osika, Hollander and Dalman.},

   journal = {Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco},
   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never-smokers. This study presents novel findings on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour in older adults. METHOD(S): Panel data were obtained from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N= 60160, 12% smokers, 55% women, 62% married, mean age = 67 years, 23% employed). Fixed effect regression models were used to estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affected smoking behaviour. A separate model was estimated for men, women, employed, and retired. RESULT(S): The findings suggest a significant and positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour (beta= 0.024; p<0.001). The estimated effects were stronger for men and for the sample of individuals reporting being employed. CONCLUSION(S): In this study, I provide robust evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. This large and representative dataset is uniquely suited for the analysis. I find evidence that the proportion of smokers has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: In the UK, the proportion of smokers increased significantly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that smoking behaviour may have been used as a mechanism to cope with depression, stress, and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. To the extent to which smoking behaviour has been used as a coping mechanism to deal with job-related issues, targeted policy action to provide financial stability to those in worse economic situations may be have beneficial effects on smoking behaviour.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

   volume = {4},

   pages = {20940},
   abstract = {Importance: Delaying critical care for treatable conditions owing to fear of contracting COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED) is associated with avoidable morbidity and mortality. Objective(s): To assess and quantify how people decided whether to present to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic for care unrelated to COVID-19 using conjoint analysis, a form of trade-off analysis that examines how individuals make complex decisions. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a nationwide sample from June 1, 2020, during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included participants were adults aged 18 years or older in the US who self-reported that they had not tested positive for COVID-19. Data were analyzed from July 2020 through May 2021. Exposures: Participants completed a self-administered online survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Using a choice-based conjoint analysis survey, the relative importance was assessed for the following attributes for individuals in deciding whether to seek ED care for symptoms consistent with myocardial infarction or appendicitis: reduction in chance of dying because of ED treatment, crowdedness of ED with other patients, and chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED. We also performed latent class analyses using conjoint data to identify distinct segments of the respondent population with similar choice patterns. Logistic regression was then used to explore whether patient sociodemographics and political affiliations were factors associated with decision-making. Result(s): Among 1981 individuals invited to participate, 933 respondents (47.1%) completed the survey; participants' mean (SD) age was 40.1 (13.0) years, and 491 (52.6%) were women. In latent class analyses, 158 individuals (16.9%) with symptoms of myocardial infarction and 238 individuals (25.5%) with symptoms of appendicitis prioritized avoidance of COVID-19 exposure in the ED (ie, chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED or crowdedness of ED with other patients) over seeking appropriate care for symptoms. Having a usual source of care was a factor associated with lower odds of prioritizing avoidance of COVID-19 exposure (myocardial infarction scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.76]; P =.001; appendicitis scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.82]; P =.003), but most sociodemographic factors and political affiliations were not factors associated with decision-making. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that up to one-quarter of individuals were willing to forgo potentially life-saving ED care to avoid exposure to COVID-19. These findings suggest that health care systems and public health organizations should develop effective communications for patients and the community at large that reassure and encourage timely health care for critical needs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other scenarios..Copyright © 2021 Massachussetts Medical Society.

   volume = {98},
   pages = {104654},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to overwhelming the healthcare system, pandemics have enormous societal and economic costs. To better train future healthcare professionals and develop collaborations across healthcare disciplines, pandemic simulations have been incorporated into undergraduate healthcare professional curricula. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of a pandemic simulation in preparing the future healthcare professionals during large-scale pandemic disasters. DESIGN: This was a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a 4-year public university in rural Texas. METHOD(S): The students (n = 89) participated in a simulation exercise that mirrored a real influenza pandemic that facilitated interactions among various first responders. Participants completed pre- and post-tests of knowledge survey questions pertaining to areas of situational awareness, communication effectiveness and public health knowledge, and the 27-item Nursing Anxiety and Self-Confidence with Clinical Decision-Making Scale. RESULT(S): The majority (76%) of the participants were between the ages of 18 to 24, Caucasians (74.2%) and female (87.6%). The results of the paired t-test showed increased situational awareness [t = 7.17(76), p < 0.001], effective communication [t = 7.130(75), p < 0.001], and public health knowledge [t = 8.77 (74), p < 0.001] following the pandemic simulation. CONCLUSION(S): Significant improvement in situational awareness, effective communication, and public health knowledge was demonstrated by the undergraduate public health and nursing students in handling disasters through the simulation exercise. The study results demonstrated value in incorporating simulation as an effective teaching strategy in preparing future healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   pages = {S1219-S1220},
   abstract = {Introduction & Objectives: It is estimated that 28 million elective surgeries have been cancelled due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (1). The resulting impact on the long-term outcome of urological cancer patients during the pandemic needs to be understood and for patients with deferred treatment may provide insight into the natural history of these cancers in a way that we could otherwise not experience. The British Urological Researchers in Surgical Training (BURST) and COVIDSurg Collaboratives, together with the Birmingham Centre for Observational and Prospective Studies (BiCOPS) are carrying out this international, multicentre, prospective observational study. We aim to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medium-term outcomes of patients with kidney, bladder and prostate cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): The original urological cohort of patients with kidney, bladder and prostate cancer consists of 2753 patients from 177 centres around the world. Patient follow-up will happen once a year for up to three years for renal and bladder cancer patients; and for one year for prostate cancer patients (Figure 1). Outcomes for kidney and bladder cancer patients include disease recurrence, survival, upstaging of disease and complications. Outcomes for prostate cancer patients includes positive surgical margin, use of neoadjuvant therapy, perioperative outcomes and complication rates. These outcomes will be compared within cohorts for patients who underwent delayed management because of the pandemic and with pre-COVID data sources to understand the differences in cancer outcomes. (Figure Presented) Results: The COVIDSurg-Cancer follow-up study is currently open for registration and all 177 of the original centres providing data have been invited to participate. It will provide multicentre data on the natural history of cancer management that could influence how we manage these cancers today. Conclusion(s): This follow up study aims to be one of the largest medium-term studies on the impact of COVID-19 on urological cancer outcomes. We hope to identify the effects of COVID-19 on the medium-term oncological outcomes of patients whose treatment has been altered by COVID-19 to inform future treatment guidelines. 1.

   abstract = {Background: As coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was pervading different parts of the world, little has been published regarding responses undertaken within primary health care facilities in the Arabian Gulf countries. This paper describes such responses from January to mid-April 2020 in primary health care including public health measures in Muscat governorate. Method(s): This is a descriptive study showing the trends of the confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 and the undertaken responses to the evolving epidemiological scenario. These responses were described utilising the World Health Organisations' building blocks for health care system: Leadership and governance, Health workforce, Service delivery, Medical products and technologies, and health information management. Result(s): In mid-April 2020, cases of COVID-19 increased to 685 (particularly amongst the non-nationals). As the cases were surging up, the primary health care responded by executing all guidelines and policies from the national medical and public health response committees and integrating innovative approaches. These included adapting comprehensive and multi-sectoral strategies, partnering with private establishments, and strengthening the use of technology (in tracking, testing, managing the cases and data management). Conclusion(s): Facilities in Muscat governorate, with the support from the national teams, seemed to continuously scale-up their preparedness and responses to meet the epidemiological expectations in the management of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

   abstract = {PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a unique challenge to oncology patients and their treatment. There is no study related to the patients' preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P, .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P, .001). CONCLUSION This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic. The treatment guidelines in the COVID-19 scenario should incorporate patients' perspectives.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United Kingdom government imposed public health policies in England to reduce social contacts in hopes of curbing virus transmission. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study to measure contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering 3 national lockdowns interspersed by periods of less restrictive policies., METHODS AND FINDINGS: The repeated cross-sectional survey data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. Survey participants were recruited by the online market research company Ipsos MORI through internet-based banner and social media ads and email campaigns. The participant data used for this analysis are restricted to those who reported living in England. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. To put the findings in perspective, we discuss contact rates recorded throughout the year in terms of previously recorded rates from the POLYMOD study social contact study. The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. We observed changes in social contact patterns in England over time and by participants' age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean reported contacts for adults 18 to 59 years old ranged between 2.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20 to 2.60) contacts and 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 to 5.19) contacts during the study period. The mean contacts for school-age children (5 to 17 years old) ranged from 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 to 16.41). This demonstrates a sustained decrease in social contacts compared to a mean of 11.08 (95% CI 10.54 to 11.57) contacts per participant in all age groups combined as measured by the POLYMOD social contact study in 2005 to 2006. Contacts measured during periods of lockdowns were lower than in periods of eased social restrictions. The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. The main limitations of this analysis are the potential for selection bias, as participants are recruited through internet-based campaigns, and recall bias, in which participants may under- or overreport the number of contacts they have made., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to prepandemic levels (as measured in the POLYMOD study), with changes in reported contacts correlated with government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, the mean number of reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed prepandemic at its highest recorded level. The CoMix survey provides a unique repeated cross-sectional data set for a full year in England, from the first day of the first lockdown, for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases.},

   abstract = {The poultry sector contributes four percent to the national GDP of Nepal. However, this sector is under threat with periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) subtypes H5 and H9 since 2009. This has been both a public health threat and an economic issue. Since the past few years, outbreaks of AI subtype H9 have caused huge economic losses in major poultry producing areas of Nepal. However, the risk factors associated with these outbreaks have not been assessed. A retrospective case-control study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2019 to understand the risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley. Out of 100 farms selected, 50 were "case" farms, confirmed positive to H9 at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Kathmandu, and another 50 farms were "control" farms, matched for farm size and locality within a radius of three km from the case farm. Each farm was visited to collect information using a semi-structured questionnaire. Twelve potential risk factors were included in the questionnaire under the broad categories: Birds and farm characteristics, and management and biosecurity status of the farms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and corresponding odds ratios were calculated. Risk factors, associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley, identified in the final multivariable model were: "farms that have flock size greater than median flock size of study farms (>1500)" (OR = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.53-12.71, p = 0.006), "farms that did not apply rules to wear boots for visitors inside the farms" (OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.52-12.29, p = 0.006) and "other commercial farms located within one km periphery" (OR = 10, 95% CI: 1.8-50, p = 0.007). This study showed that outbreaks of AI subtype H9 in Kathmandu valley were associated with a higher population of birds in the farm, poor management practices, and weak biosecurity measures in poultry farms. We suggest improving management practices and increase biosecurity in the farms to reduce incidences of AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley.Copyright © 2020 Gompo et al.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures have adversely affected the lives of people worldwide, raising concern over the pandemic's mental health consequences. Guided by a systemic model of family functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic (Prime et al., 2020), the current study aimed to examine how caregiver well-being (i.e., maternal depressive symptoms) and family organization (i.e., household chaos) are related to longitudinal trajectories of children's emotional and behavioral problems. Data were collected at four time points during and after home lockdown periods. Mothers of children (N=230; 55% male) between the ages of two to five years were asked to complete questionnaires via an Israeli online research platform. Results indicated that emotional and behavioral problems, household chaos, and maternal depressive symptoms were the highest during the first lockdown assessment and dropped in the post-lockdown periods. Multilevel models further revealed that at the between-participants level, maternal depressive symptoms and household chaos positively predicted children's emotional and behavioral problems. At the within-participants level, household chaos fluctuations positively predicted fluctuations in child behavioral but not emotional problems. Our findings suggest that lockdowns have adverse effects on both maternal and child mental health. Screening for depressive symptoms among mothers of young children and maintaining household structure are important targets for future interventions to assist parents in navigating the multiple challenges brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decrease in injury-related paediatric emergency department (ED) visits. However, the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on paediatric injury beyond the first 6 months of the pandemic is not well established. OBJECTIVE(S): To quantify the impact of COVID-19 and associated public health measures on injury-related paediatric ED visits during the first two years of the pandemic and determine whether children of all ages were similarly affected. DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study of injury-related ED visits at a large paediatric tertiary care centre before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used negative binomial regression to assess the impact of the first two years of the pandemic (Year 1: March 2020-February 2021; Year 2: March 2021-February 2022) on the monthly incidence of injury-related ED visits and risk of hospitalization from injury. Secular time-trends and seasonality were accounted for by modelling the pre-pandemic trend using a 4-year historical control (April 2016-February 2020). In a secondary stratified analysis, changes in monthly incidence of injury-related ED visits were assessed by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). RESULT(S): Of 458,799 ED visits during the 6-year study period, 21,644 (4.7%) were associated with injuries. The distribution of age categories, acuity of presentation, and frequency of hospitalization were similar between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (see Table below). Injury-related paediatric ED visits reached a low (-49%) in March 2020 (IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.60), and a peak (+50%) in January 2021 (IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.33-1.68) relative to historical controls (see Figure). All three confinement periods were associated with an initial reduction in injury-related ED visits and followed by a rapid increase in visits. Fluctuations in injury-related ED visits were found to differ between age groups. While there was evidence of no change among preschoolers 0-4 years old, there was a 52% reduction in visits at the onset of the pandemic in children ages 5-11 (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35-0.65) and an 87% reduction in children ages 12-17 (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.23) followed by a surplus of cases among the 5- to 11-year-olds in January 2021 (+53%; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25-1.85) and March 2021 (+48%, RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.21-1.80). CONCLUSION(S): The consequences of COVID-19 on paediatric injury extend far beyond the first few months of the pandemic. Understanding changes in the incidence of paediatric injury around confinement periods may assist in the development of injury prevention strategies. (Figure Presented).},

   abstract = {Estimating an epidemic's trajectory is crucial for developing public health responses to infectious diseases, but case data used for such estimation are confounded by variable testing practices. We show that the population distribution of viral loads observed under random or symptom-based surveillance-in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing-changes during an epidemic. Thus, Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory. Combining data from multiple such samples improves the precision and robustness of this estimation. We apply our methods to Ct values from surveillance conducted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in a variety of settings and offer alternative approaches for real-time estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response.Copyright © 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   abstract = {Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread lockdowns and school closures that may have affected screen time among children. Although restrictions were strongest early in the pandemic, it is unclear how screen time changed as the pandemic progressed. Objective(s): To evaluate change in children's screen time from before the pandemic to during the pandemic, from July 2019 through August 2021. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This is a longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of screen time collected before the pandemic and during 2 pandemic periods. Children aged 4 to 12 years and their parent were enrolled in 3 pediatric cohorts across 3 states in the US participating in the Environmental Influences of Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to July 2022. Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic period: prepandemic (July 2019 to March 2020), pandemic period 1 (December 2020 to April 2021), and pandemic period 2 (May 2021 to August 2021). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were total, educational (not including remote school), and recreational screen time assessed via the ECHO Child Media Use questionnaire. Linear mixed-effects models were used for screen time adjusted for child's age, number of siblings, sex, race, ethnicity, and maternal education. Result(s): The cohort included 228 children (prepandemic mean [SD] age, 7.0 [2.7] years; 100 female [43.9%]) with screen time measured during the prepandemic period and at least once during the pandemic period. Prepandemic mean (SD) total screen time was 4.4 (3.9) hours per day and increased 1.75 hours per day (95% CI, 1.18-2.31 hours per day) in the first pandemic period and 1.11 hours per day (95% CI, 0.49-1.72 hours per day) in the second pandemic period, in adjusted models. Prepandemic mean (SD) recreational screen time was 4.0 (3.5) hours per day and increased 0.89 hours per day (95% CI, 0.39-1.39 hours per day) in the first pandemic period and 0.70 hours per day (95% CI, 0.16-1.25 hours per day) in the second pandemic period. Prepandemic mean (SD) educational screen time was 0.5 (1.2) hours per day (median [IQR], 0.0 [0.0-0.4] hours per day) and increased 0.93 hours per day (95% CI, 0.67-1.19 hours per day) in the first pandemic period and 0.46 hours per day (95% CI, 0.18-0.74 hours per day) in the second pandemic period. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that screen time among children increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and remained elevated even after many public health precautions were lifted. The long-term association of increased screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic with children's health needs to be determined..Copyright © 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)},
   volume = {11},
   number = {2},
   abstract = {Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the pandemic has become an important topic of global public health. To reduce the rapid spread of the pandemic, compliance with preventive behaviors has become one of the important guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO). Healthcare workers stand on the frontline for pandemic prevention, and preventive behaviors are essential measures to protect their health and safety. The purpose of this study was to propose an integrative model that explained and predicted COVID-19 preventive behaviors among healthcare workers. The study integrated workplace safety climate and the health belief model (HBM) to verify the impact of workplace safety climate and health belief factors on the safety attitude, safety compliance, and safety satisfaction of healthcare workers performing COVID-19 pandemic prevention behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to August 2021 with a self-administered online questionnaire. The sample of the study was drawn from healthcare workers of a famous medical institution in Taipei City as research subjects. After collecting 273 valid questionnaires and verifying them through the analysis of structural equation modeling (SEM), the findings revealed that workplace safety climate had an impact on health belief factors, and then health belief factors had impacts on safety attitudes. In addition, safety attitude affected safety compliance, while safety compliance further affected safety satisfaction. The study showed that workplace safety climate can strengthen healthcare workers' health beliefs and further affect their safety attitudes, safety compliance, and safety satisfaction. The study attempted to propose a model of healthcare workers' pandemic prevention behaviors as a reference for medical facility administrators in real practice.},

   title = {Predictors of Cyberchondria During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study Using Supervised Machine Learning},
   journal = {JMIR formative research},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {e42206},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyberchondria is characterized by repeated and compulsive online searches for health information, resulting in increased health anxiety and distress. It has been conceptualized as a multidimensional construct fueled by both anxiety and compulsivity-related factors and described as a "transdiagnostic compulsive behavioral syndrome," which is associated with health anxiety, problematic internet use, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Cyberchondria is not included in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and its defining features, etiological mechanisms, and assessment continue to be debated., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate changes in the severity of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify the predictors of cyberchondria at this time., METHODS: Data collection started on May 4, 2020, and ended on June 10, 2020, which corresponds to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. At the time the study took place, French-speaking countries in Europe (France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg) all implemented lockdown or semilockdown measures. The survey consisted of a questionnaire collecting demographic information (sex, age, education level, and country of residence) and information about socioeconomic circumstances during the first lockdown (eg, economic situation, housing, and employment status) and was followed by several instruments assessing various psychological and health-related constructs. Inclusion criteria for the study were being at least 18 years of age and having a good understanding of French. Self-report data were collected from 725 participants aged 18-77 (mean 33.29, SD 12.88) years, with females constituting the majority (416/725, 57.4%)., RESULTS: The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected various facets of cyberchondria: cyberchondria-related distress and compulsion increased (distress z=-3.651, P<.001; compulsion z=-5.697, P<.001), whereas the reassurance facet of cyberchondria decreased (z=-6.680, P<.001). In addition, COVID-19-related fears and health anxiety emerged as the strongest predictors of cyberchondria-related distress and interference with functioning during the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cyberchondria and identify factors that should be considered in efforts to prevent and manage cyberchondria at times of public health crises. In addition, they are consistent with a theoretical model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic proposed in 2020.

   abstract = {Aim: Little is known about the specific restriction measures used in intensive care units (NICUs) during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on parental well-being. Hence, this study aimed to assess the association between restriction measures and mothers' post-partum depressive symptoms. Method(s): This comparative cohort study included mothers who gave birth before 35 weeks of gestation in Estonia. The outcome measure was mothers' post-partum depressive symptoms at the time of infant discharge, evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In addition to the pandemic itself, the number of restriction measures in the NICUs was analysed as a potential explanatory factor for depressive symptoms. Result(s): The study included 55 mothers before the pandemic in 2018-2019 and 54 mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. No significant difference was found in the median EPDS scores between the cohorts: 7.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 4.0-12.0] and 8.0 (IQR: 5.0-12.8) respectively. The number of restriction measures was not associated with mothers' EPDS scores in either unadjusted or adjusted models. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic or the number of restriction measures used in Estonian NICUs did not associate with mothers' post = partum depressive symptoms.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in stroke care in several countries. The objective was to describe lockdown stroke care in a tertiary stroke center in Dusseldorf, Germany near Heinsberg, a German hot spot for COVID-19 in spring 2020. Method(s): In a retrospective, observational, single-center study, we compared all patients treated in our emergency department (ED), patients seen by a neurologist in the ED, ED patients suffering from ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) as well as stroke patients admitted to our stroke unit during lockdown in spring 2020 (16 March 2020-12 April 2020) to those cared for during the same period in 2019 and lockdown light in fall 2020 (2 November - 29 November 2020). Result(s): In spring 2020 lockdown the mean number of patients admitted to our ED dropped by 37.4%, seen by a neurologist by 35.6%, ED stroke patients by 19.2% and number of patients admitted to our stroke unit by 10% compared to the same period in 2019. In fall lockdown light 2020 effects were comparable but less pronounced. Thrombolysis rate was stable during spring and fall lockdown, however, endovascular treatment (EVT) rate declined by 58% in spring lockdown and by 51% in fall lockdown compared to the period in 2019. Conclusion(s): Our study indicates a profound reduction of overall ED patients, neurological ED patients and EVT during COVID-19 pandemic caused lockdowns. Planning for pandemic scenarios should include access to effective emergency therapies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic cost of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in 31 provincial-level administrative regions and in total, in China., METHODS: We used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 January-31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs., FINDINGS: The total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US$) and 2646.70 billion (US$ 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% ( 0.95 billion/ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% ( 0.70 billion/ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% ( 2641.61 billion/ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost., CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The control measures to prevent the spread of disease resulted in substantial costs from productivity losses amounting to 2.7% (US$ 382.29 billion/US$ 14.14 trillion) of China's annual gross domestic product.

   journal = {Tropical Medicine and Health},
   volume = {51},
   number = {1},
   pages = {28},
   abstract = {Background: There are various impacts of COVID-19 on health systems of the world. The health systems of low- and middle-income countries are less developed. Therefore, they have greater tendencies to experience challenges and vulnerabilities in COVID-19 control compared to high-income countries. It is important to contain the spread of the virus, and likewise strengthen the capacity of health systems in order for the response to be effective and swift. The experience from 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone served as preparation for COVID-19 outbreak. The aim of this study is to determine how control of COVID-19 outbreak in Sierra Leone was enhanced by the lessons learned from 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak, and health systems reform. Method(s): We used data from a qualitative case study conducted in four districts in Sierra Leone through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, document, and archive record reviews. A total of 32 key informant interviews and 14 focus group discussions were conducted. A thematic analysis was used to analyze the data, and all transcripts were coded and analyzed with the aid of ATLAS.ti 9 software program. Result(s): The six themes obtained were composed of categories that connect with each other and with codes to form networks. The analysis of the responses demonstrated that "Multisectoral Leadership and Cooperation", "Government Collaboration among International Partners", and "Awareness in the Community" were among the key interventions used during the control of 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak, which were applied in the control of COVID-19. An infectious disease outbreak control model was proposed based on the results obtained from the analysis of the lessons learned during the Ebola virus disease outbreak, and health systems reform. Conclusion(s): "Multisectoral Leadership and Cooperation", "Government Collaboration among International Partners" and "Awareness in the Community" are key strategies that enhanced the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Sierra Leone. It is recommended that they are implemented in controlling COVID-19 pandemic or any other infectious disease outbreak. The proposed model can be used in controlling infectious disease outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Further research is needed to validate the usefulness of these interventions in overcoming an infectious disease outbreak.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Integrated healthcare journal},
   volume = {4},
   number = {1},
   pages = {e000061},
   abstract = {Objectives: The iConnect Care programme provided integrated 'virtual care' (VC) for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. VC is an alternative to outpatient care which expedites time to specialists' opinions and is safe. Comparing different outpatient care models is important to understand the role of telehealth and integrated care, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to compare a VC model with existing CKD outpatient care., Design participants and setting: A multisite, comparative, retrospective cohort study with parallel groups. 374 patients with mild CKD were recruited (July 2013 and August 2015) from public and private outpatients and followed for 12 months (n=304) or via VC (n=70). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) were compared at baseline, 6 and 12 months., Results: At 12 months, no significant differences existed among groups in eGFR or ACR or haemoglobin, but serum creatinine was lower in the VC cohort. A significant difference existed in time to see a patient from time of referral; 7 days for VC clinic and 35-42 days for outpatient clinic. Patients interviewed felt VC was efficient and they were well managed., Conclusion: VC can be a faster mechanism to access a nephrologist and other specialists. It provided similar outcomes to outpatient care. VC represents an additional assessment and follow-up pathway supported in the community. Time to deliver is similar, but specific resources are needed. It has the potential to evolve into a standard component of chronic disease care. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

   abstract = {Background and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic forced healthcare systems to apply new technology-based solutions. The main objective of our study was to describe the conceptual model for rapid implementation of telepharmacy service and the main steps that should be considered. Method(s): In response to a limited number of on-site clinical pharmacy specialists and a lack of technology infrastructure, a cross-sectional telepharmacy program was established to support major teaching hospitals. A store and forward model of teleconsultation was employed using WhatsApp messenger to cover various aspects of multidisciplinary collaboration in COVID-19 management. All identifiable personal information was removed from all exchanged messages of collaborative consultations. The thematic analysis of consultations was performed to extract the main themes and subthemes that should be considered for designing future telepharmacy systems. Result(s): Through telepharmacy service, 600 intensive care unit teleconsultations for COVID-19 cases were conducted in the residence center and nonresidence centers. In total, 1200 messages were exchanged between specialists in 3 months. The average time taken to respond to a message was 1.30 h. Thematic analysis revealed four main concepts and 15 subconcepts that should be considered in telepharmacy consultations for COVID-19 management. Based on the extracted themes, a conceptual model for developing a telepharmacy program was devised. Conclusion(s): The results showed that by utilizing telehealth, clinical pharmacists could cover critically ill patients who need pharmacotherapy counseling through interdisciplinary collaboration. Moreover, the main features of our service that are represented through this survey can be employed by other researchers for developing telepharmacy services.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   journal = {Journal of transport geography},
   volume = {93},

   abstract = {This paper examines changes in people's mobility over a 7-month period (from March 1st to September 30th, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. using longitudinal models and county-level mobility data obtained from people's anonymized mobile phone signals. It differentiates two distinct waves of the study period: Wave 1 (March-June) and Wave 2 (June-September). It also analyzes the relationships of these mobility changes with various social, spatial, policy, and political factors. The results indicate that mobility changes in Wave 1 have a V-shaped trend: people's mobility first declined at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-April) but quickly recovered to the pre-pandemic mobility levels from April to June. The rates of mobility changes during this period are significantly associated with most of our key variables, including political partisanship, poverty level, and the strictness of mobility restriction policies. For Wave 2, there was very little mobility decline despite the existence of mobility restriction policies and the COVID-19 pandemic becoming more severe. Our findings suggest that restricting people's mobility to control the pandemic may be effective only for a short period, especially in liberal democratic societies. Further, since poor people (who are mostly essential workers) kept traveling during the pandemic, health authorities should pay special attention to these people by implementing policies to mitigate their high COVID-19 exposure risk.

   journal = {American Journal of Emergency Medicine},
   volume = {60},
   pages = {9-14},
   abstract = {Introduction: Some guidelines had recommended "thrombolysis first" in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The impact of COVID-19 solely on STEMI thrombolysis is lacking as most studies reported outcomes related to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) setting. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STEMI thrombolysis outcomes and the Emergency Department's performance in a non-PCI capable centre. Method(s): This single-centre retrospective study analysed data on consecutive STEMI patients who received thrombolytic therapy from May 2019 to December 2020 (20 months) in a non-PCI capable tertiary hospital. Total population sampling was used in this study. We compared all patients' characteristics and outcomes ten months before and during the pandemic. Regression models were used to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on door-to-needle time (DNT), mortality, bleeding events, and the number of overnight stays. Results and discussion: We analysed 323 patients with a mean age of 52.9 +/- 12.9 years and were predominantly male (n = 280, 88.9%). There was a 12.5% reduction in thrombolysis performed during the pandemic. No significant difference in timing from symptoms onset to thrombolysis and DNT was observed. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.02-4.00, p = 0.044). Bleeding events post thrombolysis remained stable and there was no significant difference in the number of overnight stays during the pandemic. Conclusion(s): STEMI thrombolysis cases were reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an inverse increase in mortality despite the preserved Emergency Department performance in timely thrombolysis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {A COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health crisis across the globe. People are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in India to better understand their psychological distress, associated risk factors after one month of nationwide lock-down during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A cross-sectional, observational study was carried out in India. We used snowball sampling technique and the data was collected using an online self-designed semi-structured questionnaire developed by using google forms. Result(s): Findings revealed significant rise in perceived susceptibility to COVID-19. Around 62% were dreaded of COVID-19 infection and perceived to be at risk of the same. A significant association was found between perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and psychological distress (p value = 0.007) as well as between psychological distress with not having family around during lockdown (p value = 0.012). Discussion(s): As disease progresses, the psychological distress levels were also influenced by rising cases, media exposure, lock-down, and prevention and control measures taken against the epidemic situation. The Health Belief Model advocates that only those individuals who perceive themselves at risk of developing a disease will engage in behaviours to reduce their risk of developing the disease. Considering high perceived susceptibility for COVID-19, stimulus should be provided to the population for eliciting health promotion behaviours among them. The health promotion messages should be delivered using a mix of various effective communication strategies.Copyright © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

We re-enrolled children from two pre-pandemic obesity prevention trials and examined differences in accelerometer-measured PA from pre-pandemic to early-pandemic across age groups using linear mixed models. Children (n = 75) were 51% multiple race/ethnicities, 29% preschool, 28% elementary, 43% middle school, 65% suburban, 21% rural, and 13% urban. Pre-pandemic to early-pandemic changes in weekday MVPA (p = 0.006), LPA (p = 0.018), and SS (p = 0.003) differed by age. On weekdays, middle schoolers' MVPA decreased 15.36 min/day (p = 0.002) and SS increased 94.36 min/day (p < 0.001) with non-significant changes among preschoolers and elementary schoolers. Compared to elementary schoolers, middle schoolers' changes in weekday MVPA (b = -16.34, p = 0.036) and SS (b = 63.28, p = 0.039) significantly differed. Declines in weekday MVPA and increases in SS among middle schoolers suggest that, compared with younger children, middle schoolers are dependent on school and recreational facilities for PA, and in their absence engage in more sedentary activities and sleep.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {School teachers have faced many challenges due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and public health-related containment measures. Recent studies have demonstrated high levels of stress and mental health issues among school teachers. To better understand teacher well-being and inform practices to support them in the face of the ongoing pandemic, we aimed to assess perceived stress, well-being and associated factors among school teachers in Hong Kong, China. For this cross-sectional study, we employed a self-reported questionnaire to assess teacher well-being as an indicator of mental health. Drawing on quantitative data obtained from 336 teachers in Hong Kong from April 2021 to February 2022, we assessed workloads, work-related sense of coherence, perceived stress, secondary burnout symptoms (i.e. intensification of work and exhaustion related to work situation), self-endangering work behaviours and satisfaction with work. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the associations between well-being, demographic and work characteristics. A high percentage (87.6%) of teachers had high levels of perceived stress, which was positively associated with extensification of work (r = 0.571, p < 0.01), intensification of work (r = 0.640, p < 0.01) and exhaustion related to work situation (r = 0.554, p < 0.01). A multilinear regression model adjusted for age and gender was computed to detect predictors of teachers' well-being index values (F(12, 296) = 41.405, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.627). A higher WHO-5 score was associated with (1) higher teaching hours (B = 0.235, 95% CI = 0.093, 0.413, p = 0.002); (2) higher work-related sense of coherence (B = 2.490, 95% CI = 0.209, 4.770, p = 0.032); (3) higher work satisfaction (B = 5.410, 95% CI = 2.979, 7.841, p < 0.001); (4) lower level of exhaustion related to work situations (B = -9.677, 95% CI = -12.279, -7.075, p < 0.001); and (5) lower level of psychosomatic complaints (B = -4.167, 95% CI = -6.739, -7.075, p = 0.002). These findings highlight the critical need to allocate more attention and resources to improve the mental health of school teachers in Hong Kong. The findings can also inform the development of psychological and organisational interventions and support mechanisms for teachers during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future stressful scenarios. Safeguarding the well-being and mental health of teachers is important for improving the quality of teaching and learning environments and the mental health of school students.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model offers the simplest framework to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19, however, it does not factor in its early depleting trend observed during a lockdown. We modified the SIR model to specifically simulate the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better predict its temporal trend in Malaysia. The classical SIR model was fitted to observed total (I total), active (I) and removed (R) cases of COVID-19 before lockdown to estimate the basic reproduction number. Next, the model was modified with a partial time-varying force of infection, given by a proportionally depleting transmission coefficient, [Formula: see text] and a fractional term, z. The modified SIR model was then fitted to observed data over 6 weeks during the lockdown. Model fitting and projection were validated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 was interrupted immediately by the lockdown. The modified SIR model projected the depleting temporal trends with lowest MAPE for I total, followed by I, I daily and R. During lockdown, the dynamics of COVID-19 depleted at a rate of 4.7% each day with a decreased capacity of 40%. For 7-day and 14-day projections, the modified SIR model accurately predicted I total, I and R. The depleting transmission dynamics for COVID-19 during lockdown can be accurately captured by time-varying SIR model. Projection generated based on observed data is useful for future planning and control of COVID-19.},

   journal = {BMC medical research methodology},
   volume = {23},
   number = {1},
   pages = {182},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bayesian models have been applied throughout the Covid-19 pandemic especially to model time series of case counts or deaths. Fewer examples exist of spatio-temporal modeling, even though the spatial spread of disease is a crucial factor in public health monitoring. The predictive capabilities of infectious disease models is also important. METHOD(S): In this study, the ability of Bayesian hierarchical models to recover different parts of the variation in disease counts is the focus. It is clear that different measures provide different views of behavior when models are fitted prospectively. Over a series of time horizons one step predictions have been generated and compared for different models (for case counts and death counts). These Bayesian SIR models were fitted using MCMC at 28 time horizons to mimic prospective prediction. A range of goodness of prediction measures were analyzed across the different time horizons. RESULT(S): A particularly important result is that the peak intensity of case load is often under-estimated, while random spikes in case load can be mimicked using time dependent random effects. It is also clear that during the early wave of the pandemic simpler model forms are favored, but subsequently lagged spatial dependence models for cases are favored, even if the sophisticated models perform better overall. DISCUSSION: The models fitted mimic the situation where at a given time the history of the process is known but the future must be predicted based on the current evolution which has been observed. Using an overall 'best' model for prediction based on retrospective fitting of the complete pandemic waves is an assumption. However it is also clear that this case count model is well favored over other forms. During the first wave a simpler time series model predicts case counts better for counties than a spatially dependent one. The picture is more varied for morality. CONCLUSION(S): From a predictive point of view it is clear that spatio-temporal models applied to county level Covid-19 data within the US vary in how well they fit over time and also how well they predict future events. At different times, SIR case count models and also mortality models with cumulative counts perform better in terms of prediction. A fundamental result is that predictive capability of models varies over time and using the same model could lead to poor predictive performance. In addition it is clear that models addressing the spatial context for case counts (i.e. with lagged neighborhood terms) and cumulative case counts for mortality data are clearly better at modeling spatio-temporal data which is commonly available for the Covid-19 pandemic in different areas of the globe.Copyright © 2023.

   abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on University students has been a topic of fiery debate and of public health research. This study demonstrates the use of a combination of spatiotemporal epidemiological models to describe the trends in COVID-19 positive cases on spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal scales. In addition, this study proposes new epidemiological metrics to describe the connectivity between observed positivity; an analogous metric to the R number in conventional epidemiology. The proposed indices, Rspatial, Rspatiotemporal and Rscaling will aim to improve the characterisation of the spread of infectious disease beyond that of the COVID-19 framework and as a result inform relevant public health policy. Apart from demonstrating the application of the novel epidemiological indices, the key findings in this study are: firstly, there were some Intermediate Zones in Edinburgh with noticeably high levels of COVID-19 positivity, and that the first outbreak during the study period was observed in Dalry and Fountainbridge. Secondly, the estimation of the distance over which the COVID-19 counts at the halls of residence are spatially correlated (or related to each other) was found to be 0.19km (0.13km to 0.27km) and is denoted by the index, Rspatial. This estimate is useful for public health policy in this setting, especially with contact tracing. Thirdly, the study indicates that the association between the surrounding community level of COVID-19 positivity (Intermediate Zones in Edinburgh) and that of the University of Edinburgh's halls of residence was not statistically significant. Fourthly, this study reveals that relatively high levels of COVID-19 positivity were observed for halls for which higher COVID-19 fines were issued (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.34), and separately, for halls which were non-ensuite relatively to those which were not (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.16). Finally, Intermediate Zones with the highest positivity were associated with student residences that experienced relatively high COVID-19 positivity (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.27).Copyright © 2023 Laxton et al.

   title = {Dynamic models augmented by hierarchical data: an application of estimating HIV epidemics at sub-national level},
   journal = {Biostatistics (Oxford, England)},
   abstract = {Dynamic models have been successfully used in producing estimates of HIV epidemics at the national level due to their epidemiological nature and their ability to estimate prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates simultaneously. Recently, HIV interventions and policies have required more information at sub-national levels to support local planning, decision-making and resource allocation. Unfortunately, many areas lack sufficient data for deriving stable and reliable results, and this is a critical technical barrier to more stratified estimates. One solution is to borrow information from other areas within the same country. However, directly assuming hierarchical structures within the HIV dynamic models is complicated and computationally time-consuming. In this article, we propose a simple and innovative way to incorporate hierarchical information into the dynamical systems by using auxiliary data. The proposed method efficiently uses information from multiple areas within each country without increasing the computational burden. As a result, the new model improves predictive ability and uncertainty assessment.Copyright © The Author 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.},

   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {19},

   pages = {1014},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many tropical countries are currently experiencing dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and also more recently Zika (ZIKA) epidemics (particularly in Latin America). Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe. METHOD(S): To this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members. RESULT(S): We found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Arboviruses, such as dengue (DENV), zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), constitute a growing urban public health threat. Focusing on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, their primary vectors, is crucial for mitigation. While traditional immature-stage mosquito surveillance has limitations, capturing adult mosquitoes through traps yields more accurate data on disease transmission. However, deploying traps presents logistical and financial challenges, demonstrating effective temporal predictions but lacking spatial accuracy. Our goal is to identify smaller representative areas within cities to enhance the early warning system for DENV outbreaks. Method(s): We created Sentinel Geographic Units (SGUs), smaller areas of 1 km2 within each stratum, larger areas, with the aim of aligning the Trap Positivity Index (TPI) and Adult Density Index (ADI) with their respective strata. We conducted a two-step evaluation of SGUs. First, we examined the equivalence of TPI and ADI between SGUs and strata from January 2017 to July 2022. Second, we assessed the ability of SGU's TPI and ADI to predict DENV outbreaks in comparison to Foz do Iguacu's Early-Warning System, which forecasts outbreaks up to 4 weeks ahead. Spatial and temporal analyses were carried out, including data interpolation and model selection based on Akaike information criteria (AIC). Result(s): Entomological indicators produced in small SGUs can effectively replace larger sentinel areas to access dengue outbreaks. Based on historical data, the best predictive capability is achieved 2 weeks after infestation verification. Implementing the SGU strategy with more frequent sampling can provide more precise space-time estimates and enhance dengue control. Conclusion(s): The implementation of SGUs offers an efficient way to monitor mosquito populations, reducing the need for extensive resources. This approach has the potential to improve dengue transmission management and enhance the public health response in endemic cities.Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Evaluating cross-country variability on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis (TB) may provide urgent inputs to control programs as countries recover from the pandemic. We compared expected TB notifications, modeled using trends in annual TB notifications from 2013-2019, with observed TB notifications to compute the observed to expected (OE) ratios for 170 countries. We applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to identify the covariates, out of 27 pandemic- and tuberculosis-relevant variables, that had the strongest explanatory power for log OE ratios. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 1.55 million (95% CI: 1.26-1.85, 21.0% [17.5-24.6%]) decrease in TB diagnoses in 2020 and a 1.28 million (0.90-1.76, 16.6% [12.1-21.2%]) decrease in 2021 at a global level. India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China contributed the most to the global declines for both years, while sub-Saharan Africa achieved pre-pandemic levels by 2021 (OE ratio = 1.02 [0.99-1.05]). Age-stratified analyses revealed that the >= 65-year-old age group experienced greater relative declines in TB diagnoses compared with the under 65-year-old age group in 2020 (RR = 0.88 [0.81-0.96]) and 2021 (RR = 0.88 [0.79-0.98]) globally. Covariates found to be associated with all-age OE ratios in 2020 were age-standardized smoking prevalence in 2019 (beta = 0.973 [0.957-990]), school closures (beta = 0.988 [0.977-0.998]), stay-at-home orders (beta = 0.993 [0.985-1.00]), SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (beta = 0.991 [0.987-0.996]), and proportion of population >=65 years (beta = 0.971 [0.944-0.999]). Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which the observed declines in TB diagnoses were attributable to disruptions in health services, decreases in TB transmission, and COVID-19 mortality among TB patients.},

   pages = {e0262244},
   abstract = {Given a sequence of epidemic events, can a single epidemic model capture its dynamics during the entire period? How should we divide the sequence into segments to better capture the dynamics? Throughout human history, infectious diseases (e.g., the Black Death and COVID-19) have been serious threats. Consequently, understanding and forecasting the evolving patterns of epidemic events are critical for prevention and decision making. To this end, epidemic models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which effectively describe dynamic systems in many fields, have been employed. However, a single epidemic model is not enough to capture long-term dynamics of epidemic events especially when the dynamics heavily depend on external factors (e.g., lockdown and the capability to perform tests). In this work, we demonstrate that properly dividing the event sequence regarding COVID-19 (specifically, the numbers of active cases, recoveries, and deaths) into multiple segments and fitting a simple epidemic model to each segment leads to a better fit with fewer parameters than fitting a complex model to the entire sequence. Moreover, we propose a methodology for balancing the number of segments and the complexity of epidemic models, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Our methodology is (a) Automatic: not requiring any user-defined parameters, (b) Model-agnostic: applicable to any ODE-based epidemic models, and (c) Effective: effectively describing and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in 70 countries.Copyright © 2022 Public Library of Science.

In phase 2, efforts were concentrated on responding to mass infections in high-risk facilities. Phase 3 involved a transition from a high-intensity social distancing campaign to a citizen participation-based quarantine system. The evaluation using the response model revealed insufficient systematic preparation for a medical surge. In addition, an incorporated health-related management system and protection measures for responders were absent. Nevertheless, the city encouraged the participation of private hospitals and developed a severity classification system. Citizens also played active roles in the pandemic response by practicing social distancing. Conclusion(s): This study employed the response model to evaluate the early response in Daegu to the COVID-19 pandemic and revealed areas in need of improvement or maintenance. Based on the study results, creation of a systematic model is necessary to prepare for and respond to future public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2022 The Korean Society for Preventive Medicine.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the concept of the "feelings of entrapment" during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic using a systematic review. We included literature based on content and outcomes related to feelings of entrapment, such as antecedents, attributes, and consequences. The exclusion criteria were studies that did not have inappropriate subject, content, conceptual definition, and degree thesis was excluded. Walker and Avant's process of concept analysis was used in this systematic literature review. The attributes of the concept of feelings of entrapment during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be feelings of: (1) being out of control, (2) no escape, (3) being trapped, (4) being robbed, and (5) hopelessness. The causes for these were identified as (1) the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) lockdown system, (3) restricted situation, (4) uncertain future, (5) economic hardship, and (6) poor coping abilities. Consequences of the concept were: (1) increased suicide, (2) decreased mental health, and (3) decreased well-being. In situations such as COVID-19, it is important need to know what feelings of entrapment's antecedents and attributes are to prevent suicide and enhance mental health and well-being. Based on the results of this study, counseling services, policies, and systems for relieving feelings of entrapment in the COVID-19 situation are recommended.},

As the virus swept through the country, underserved racial and ethnic minority populations disproportionately bore the brunt of the hospitalizations, severe illness, and fatalities. The devastation among these groups far outstripped their privileged counterparts due to convergence of disadvantages that created a perfect storm of exposures. We used empirical evidence incorporated into a theoretical framework analyzing vulnerabilities that have long plagued these communities. These exposures were further exacerbated by the rapid transmission of this virus and impaired the capability of these communities to escape illness and death due to a lack of adequate public health and medical responses. Will the aftermath of this coronavirus prove to be a reckoning for how American society addresses the conditions of most vulnerable populations or another ignored data-point?

   abstract = {How important is the speed and intensity of behavioral change due to government policies, such as enhanced social distancing or lockdown, when an emerging infectious disease occurs? In this study, we introduce a deterministic SEIR model considering the behavior-changed susceptible group to investigate the effect of the speed and intensity of behavioral change on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We used epidemiological data from South Korea and Italy for the simulation study, because South Korea and Italy were the first countries to report an outbreak of COVID-19 after China and the prevention and response policy of each government were similar during the first outbreak of COVID-19. Simulation results showed that it took approximately twenty fewer days in Korea than in Italy until 90% of susceptible individuals changed their behavior during the first outbreak. It was observed that the behavior-changed susceptible individuals reduced the COVID-19 transmission rate by up to 93% in Korea and 77% in Italy. Furthermore, if the intensity and speed of behavioral change in Italy were the same as in Korea, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been reduced by approximately 95%, from 210,700 to 10,700, until the end of the lockdown period. We assumed that behavioral change is influenced by the number of confirmed cases and does not take into account social and cultural differences, as well as the state of the healthcare system, between the two countries. Our mathematical modeling showed how important the high intensity and fast speed of behavioral change to reduce the number of confirmed cases in the early period of an epidemic are.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {This article examines how organizational and supervisory supports, directly and indirectly, impact employee engagement in U.S. federal agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study applies two analysis models for two different sample groups: federal workers who were required to be physically present at a worksite during the pandemic and those who were not required to do so. Drawing from the sampling frame comprised of "permanently employed, non-political, non-seasonal, full- or part-time federal employees" in pay status as of October 2019, the findings from the U.S. Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey 2020 indicate that organizational and supervisory supports directly impact employee engagement regardless of employees' work arrangements. However, work engagement is not increased by organizational and supervisory supports that actively encourage employees to use conventional incentives such as work-life balance policies. At the organizational level, this study suggests the need to redesign strategies to motivate public agents to engage in the agency's mission because conventional and systemic employee support may be ineffective as currently designed. Overall, this study sheds more light on existing studies of public human resource management by examining employee engagement according to work arrangements during the pandemic.

   journal = {American journal of epidemiology},
   abstract = {Forecasting of seasonal mortality patterns can provide useful information for planning healthcare demand and capacity. Timely mortality forecasts are needed during severe winter spikes and/or pandemic waves to guide policy-making and public health decisions. In this study, we propose a flexible method to forecast all-cause mortality in real-time considering short-term changes in seasonal patterns within an epidemiological year. All-cause mortality data has the advantage of being available with less delay than cause-specific mortality data. We use all-cause monthly death counts from national statistical offices for Denmark, France, Spain, and Sweden from seasons 2012/13 through 2021/22 to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. The method forecasts the deaths one-month-ahead, based on their expected ratio to the next month. Prediction intervals are obtained via bootstrapping. The forecasts accurately predict the winter peaks before COVID-19. Although the method predicts mortality less accurately during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it captures the aspects of later waves better than other traditional methods. The method is attractive for health researchers and governmental offices to aid public health responses because it uses minimal input data, makes simple and intuitive assumptions, and provides accurate forecasts both during seasonal influenza epidemics and during novel virus pandemics.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

   title = {Estimating China's CO2 emissions under the influence of COVID-19 epidemic using a novel fractional multivariate nonlinear grey model},
   journal = {Environment, development and sustainability},
   pages = {1-32},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe challenge to the global economic recovery and China's economic growth. Although China has achieved stage victory against the epidemic, the impact and influence of the epidemic on China's economy will linger. On the positive side, the epidemic has led to a dramatic reduction in air pollution levels and a sharp slowdown in greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2. Forecasting China's CO2 emissions under the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for formulating policies that contribute to smooth economic development and rational energy consumption. To this end, this paper improves on the traditional grey model, GM(1, N), by developing a novel fractional multivariate nonlinear grey model, FMNGM(q, N). These improvements include two key points. First, different power exponents are assigned to each relevant factor variable to explain their nonlinear, uncertain, and complicated relationships with the system characteristic variables. Second, the integer accumulation is changed to fractional accumulation to preprocess the data, and the Caputo-type fractional derivative is used to characterize the endogenous relationships among the system characteristic data. In addition, the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to optimize the above parameters with the goal of minimizing MAPE. The collected data on China's CO2 emission from 2001 to 2018 were divided into two parts according to different stages of economic development: 2001-2009 and 2010-2018. Both sets of data were modelled and analysed separately and compared with other models. Results showed that the proposed model had better prediction accuracy than other models. Finally, the model built using the 2010-2018 data was used to forecast China's CO2 emissions. Results show that China's CO2 emissions in 2020 under the impact of COVID-19 will decrease by approximately 3.15% from 2019 to 9893 million tons. The results bear important policy implications for planners in investment in clean energy and infrastructure to achieving the goal of a low-carbon transition.

   abstract = {Background: Healthcare across all sectors, in the UK and globally, was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed healthcare services delivered to people with pancreatic cancer from January 2015 to March 2023 to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): With the approval of NHS England, and drawing from a nationally representative Open- SAFELY-TPP dataset of 24 million patients (over 40% of the English population), we undertook a cohort study of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We queried electronic healthcare records for information on the provision of healthcare services across the pancreatic cancer pathway. To estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, we predicted the rates of healthcare services if the pandemic had not happened. We used generalised linear models and the pre-pandemic data from January 2015 to February 2020 to predict rates in March 2020 to March 2023. The 95% confidence intervals of the predicted values were used to estimate the significance of the difference between the predicted and observed rates. Result(s): The rate of pancreatic cancer and diabetes diagnoses in the cohort was not affected by the pandemic. There were 26,840 people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from January 2015 to March 2023. The mean age at diagnosis was 72 (+/-11 SD), 48% of people were female, 95% were of White ethnicity, and 40% were diagnosed with diabetes. We found a reduction in surgical resections by 25-28% during the pandemic. In addition, 20%, 10%, and 4% fewer people received body mass index, glycated haemoglobin, and liver function tests, respectively, before they were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. There was no impact of the pandemic on the number of people making contact with primary care, but the number of contacts increased on average by 1-2 per person amongst those who made contact. Reporting of jaundice decreased by 28%, but recovered within 12 months into the pandemic. Emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths were not affected. Conclusion(s): The pandemic affected healthcare in England across the pancreatic cancer pathway. Positive lessons could be learnt from the services that were resilient and those that recovered quickly. The reductions in healthcare experienced by people with cancer have the potential to lead to worse outcomes. Current efforts should focus on addressing the unmet needs of people with cancer.

   abstract = {Aim: To find whether an emergent airborne infection is more likely to spread among healthcare workers (HCW) based on data of SARS-CoV-2 and whether the number of new cases of such airborne viral disease can be predicted using a method traditionally used in weather forecasting called Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA). Method(s): We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 spread among HCWs based on outpatient nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and compared it to non-HCW in the first and the second wave of the pandemic. We also generated an ARFIMA model based on weekly case numbers from February 2020 to April 2021 and tested it on data from May to July 2021. Result(s): Our analysis of 8998 tests in the 15 months period showed a rapid rise in positive RT-PCR tests among HCWs during the first wave of pandemic. In the second wave, however, positive patients were more commonly non-HCWs. The ARFIMA model showed a long-memory pattern for SARS-CoV-2 (seven months) and predicted future new cases with an average error of +/-1.9 cases per week. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that the virus rapidly spread among HCWs during the first wave of the pandemic. Review of published literature showed that this was the case in multiple other areas as well. We therefore suggest strict policies early in the emergence of a new infection to protect HCWs and prevent spreading to the general public. The ARFIMA model can be a valuable forecasting tool to predict the number of new cases in advance and assist in efficient planning.Copyright © 2022 Leme et al.},

   abstract = {Objective To create an informatics supportive tool, which can assist healthcare professionals in estimating potential requirements for essential drug supplies to respond to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic based on epidemiological forecasting. Methods The tool was based on a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model in which the population is divided into three compartments and transmission parameters are specified to define the rate at which people move between stages. Appropriate data entry was guaranteed by the creation of structured guided paths. The drugs needed for the forecasted patients were estimated according to a list of critical care drugs compiled by consulting previous published scientific works, national and international guidelines. For each drug, an estimation was made of the percentage average ICU uptake for each therapeutic group and active principle. Results The tool consists of a Microsoft Excel template that is based on the initial epidemiological situation, the non-pharmaceutical interventions applied, the risk of hospitalisation based on the population age distribution, and the hospital beds available. The tool provides a forecast of which patients with COVID-19 will need to be treated in a hospital setting. The number of patients is used to estimate the drugs needed based on the average daily dose and the treatment length of each drug. The possibility of editing the type of distribution (exponential or linear) of the number of patients at the beginning of the analysis, the percentage adherence with non-pharmaceutical interventions and their delayed effect, and all the key epidemiological parameters make the estimation tailorable to different clinical contexts and needs. Conclusions This model might be an effective supporting tool that could be easily implemented within the workflow of health professionals. All the information reported in this paper could be useful in developing new strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Frontiers in psychology},
   volume = {12},
   pages = {631791},
   abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic is a long-lasting process associated with dynamic changes within society and in individual psychological responses. Effective communication of measures by credible sources throughout the epidemic is one of the crucial factors for the containment of the disease, and the official communication about pandemics is straightforwardly directed toward changes in behavior via engagement in (self-)protective measures. Calls for the adherence to these measures are aimed at the general population, but people's reactions to these calls vary depending on, for example, their individual differences in cognitive and emotional responses to the situation. The focus of our study was the general narrative about the epidemic as conveyed by both state officials and media outlets in times of decreased social contacts due to the quarantine, in which relying on these sources of information is even more pivotal. Our aim was to explore the stability of the proposed mediational model during the course of the epidemic in Serbia. In the model, we tested the relationship between perceived credibility of information (PCI) and two types of protective behavior-the actual self-protective behavior (ASPB) and the hypothetical protective behavior (HPB), as well as the potential mediating role of alertness in these relationships time-wise. A cross-sectional study (N = 10,782, female = 79.1%) was being administered daily during the first epidemic wave and in three more 2-week time frames during the second wave. Based on the variability of these measures during the first epidemic wave, three stages of psychological responses were mapped (acute, adaptation, and relaxation stage), which were observed, with some deviations, also in the second wave. The mediational model was relatively robust after the initial few weeks, but the strength of pairwise relationships was more changeable. With both types of protective behaviors, the predictive power of PCI was partially mediated through alertness. This suggests that, while individual differences in cognitive and affective responses are important, so is coherent, focused, and credible communication in all stages of the epidemic, which emphasizes the communality aspect of the social containment of the infection. Our findings can thus be valuable in informing the planning of effective future communication. Copyright © 2021 Lep, Ilic, Teovanovic, Hacin Beyazoglu and Damnjanovic.},

The Chinese diaspora in Canada were one such group due to the widespread cultural stigma surrounding their purported greater susceptibility to transmit and become infected by COVID-19. This paper aims to understand the social vulnerability of the Chinese diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, during the first wave of COVID-19 from an explanation of their risk perception and threat appraisal of risk communication. We conducted secondary data analysis of 36 interviews using critical realism. The participants self-identified as being of Chinese descent. The results were used to develop a model of how social vulnerability occurred. In brief, cognitive dissonance was discovered to generate conflicts of one's cultural identity, shaped by social structures of (i) stigma of contagion, (ii) ethnic stigma, and (iii) public sentiment, and mediated by participants' threat appraisal and (iv) self-reliance. We assert that risk communicators need to consider their audiences' diverse socialization in crafting messages to modify behaviors, create a sense of responsibility, and mitigate public health threats. A lack of awareness of one's cognitive dissonance driven by cultural vulnerability may heighten their social vulnerability and prevent them from taking action to protect themself from high-risk events.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Pandemic fatigue is a growing public health concern of the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its widespread mass media coverage, systematic empirical investigations are scarce. Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project, we conducted online and telephone surveys amid the pandemic in February to March 2021 to assess self-reported pandemic fatigue (range 0-10) in Hong Kong adults (N=4726) and its associations with sociodemographic and psycho-behavioral (high vs low to moderate) variables. Data were weighted by sex, age, and education of the general population. Binary logistic regression models yielded adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for high pandemic fatigue (score>=7) for sociodemographic and psycho-behavioral variables. 43.7% reported high pandemic fatigue. It was less common in older people (55-64 years: aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.82; 65+years: 0.33, 0.21-0.52) versus age group 18-24 years, but more common in those with tertiary education (1.36, 1.15-1.62) versus secondary or below. High pandemic fatigue was positively associated with depressive symptoms (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.55-2.17), anxiety symptoms (1.87, 1.58-2.20), loneliness (1.75, 1.32-2.31), personal fear of COVID-19 (2.61, 2.12-3.23), family fear of COVID-19 (2.03, 1.67-2.47), and current alcohol use (1.16, 1.00-1.33), but negatively associated with self-rated health (0.79, 0.68-0.92), personal happiness (0.63, 0.55-0.72), personal adversity coping capability (0.71, 0.63-0.81), family adversity coping capability (0.79, 0.69-0.90), family well-being (0.84, 0.73-0.97), family communication quality (0.86, 0.75-0.98), and frequent home exercise (0.82, 0.69-0.96; versus less frequent). We first used a single-item tool to measure COVID-19 pandemic fatigue, showing that it was common and associated with worse mental health, lower levels of personal and family well-being and alcohol use.Copyright © 2022.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As of March 18, 2020, 13 415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province-the epicentre of the outbreak-had been reported. Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei., METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible-infectious-recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave., FINDINGS: In all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0.98% (95% CI 0.82-1.16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5.91%, 5.73-6.09). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt >1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level., INTERPRETATION: The first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection., FUNDING: Health and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong, China.

   abstract = {Objectives: Influenced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the primary and secondary school was postponed to start school in the spring semester. The Ministry of education has proposed a new measure to stop classes and stop learning. Schools in all areas of China have responded to online teaching. Teachers play an important role in teaching practice, but there is few research on the subjects related to teachers in online education. What's more, online education is the trend of education development, which will roll forward with the development of technology, and will not stop abruptly after the epidemic of COVID-19. This nationwide online teaching is a huge test of online education in China, but it is also opportunities for development of online education in China's basic education (primary and secondary schools). The purpose of this study is to provide research results related to teachers' self-awareness for online teaching during the epidemic of COVID-19 by investigating the implementation of online teaching of primary and secondary school teachers in special period and the correlation between self-efficacy, participation and satisfaction of online teaching of primary and secondary school teachers. And hope to attract the attention of institutions and researchers on the internal and external factors of the three dimensions that affect teachers' self-awareness in online teaching, so as to carry out targeted construction, guidance and intervention. Method(s): This paper presents 220 primary and secondary school teachers' online teaching during the epidemic, and simulated the relationship among self-efficacy, participation and satisfaction of primary and secondary school teachers' online teaching during the epidemic of COVID-19. Result(s): The results show that teachers' self-efficacy, satisfaction and participation need to be improved, especially in teaching participation. Secondly, teachers' self-efficacy and participation in online teaching can predict the satisfaction of online teaching, and the participation in online teaching can significantly mediate the self-efficacy and satisfaction of online teaching. Conclusion(s): Online teaching participation has a significant mediating effect on online teaching self-efficacy and online teaching satisfaction. So understanding the intermediary role of online teaching participation may help schools and relevant decision makers understand their teacher roles, so as to provide incentive resources for teachers.},

   abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the accurate forecasting and profiling of the supply of fresh commodities in urban supermarket chains may help the city government make better economic decisions, support activities of daily living, and optimize transportation to support social governance. In urban supermarket chains, the large variety of fresh commodities and the short shelf life of fresh commodities lead to the poor performance of the traditional fresh commodity supply forecasting algorithm., Methods: Unlike the classic method of forecasting a single type of fresh commodity, we proposed a third-order exponential regression algorithm incorporating the block Hankle tensor. First, a multi-way delay embedding transform was used to fuse multiple fresh commodities sales to a Hankle tensor, for aggregating the correlation and mutual information of the whole category of fresh commodities. Second, high-order orthogonal iterations were performed for tensor decomposition, which effectively extracted the high-dimensional features of multiple related fresh commodities sales time series. Finally, a tensor quantization third-order exponential regression algorithm was employed to simultaneously predict the sales of multiple correlated fresh produce items., Results: The experiment result showed that the provided tensor quantization exponential regression method reduced the normalized root mean square error by 24% and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error by 22%, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

   volume = {172},
   pages = {107765},
   abstract = {The potential utility of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning tool has been explored widely across the globe during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were developed early in the pandemic, and extensive work has been conducted to evaluate the relationship between viral concentration and COVID-19 case numbers at the catchment areas of sewage treatment works (STWs) over time. However, no attempt has been made to develop a model that predicts wastewater concentration at fine spatio-temporal resolutions covering an entire country, a necessary step towards using wastewater monitoring for the early detection of local outbreaks. We consider weekly averages of flow-normalised viral concentration, reported as the number of SARS-CoV-2N1 gene copies per litre (gc/L) of wastewater available at 303 STWs over the period between 1 June 2021 and 30 March 2022. We specify a spatially continuous statistical model that quantifies the relationship between weekly viral concentration and a collection of covariates covering socio-demographics, land cover and virus associated genomic characteristics at STW catchment areas while accounting for spatial and temporal correlation. We evaluate the model's predictive performance at the catchment level through 10-fold cross-validation. We predict the weekly viral concentration at the population-weighted centroid of the 32,844 lower super output areas (LSOAs) in England, then aggregate these LSOA predictions to the Lower Tier Local Authority level (LTLA), a geography that is more relevant to public health policy-making. We also use the model outputs to quantify the probability of local changes of direction (increases or decreases) in viral concentration over short periods (e.g. two consecutive weeks). The proposed statistical framework can predict SARS-CoV-2 viral concentration in wastewater at high spatio-temporal resolution across England. Additionally, the probabilistic quantification of local changes can be used as an early warning tool for public health surveillance.Copyright © 2023},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a non-smooth human influenza model with logistic source to describe the impact on media coverage and quarantine of susceptible populations of the human influenza transmission process. First, we choose two thresholds $ I_{T} $ and $ S_{T} $ as a broken line control strategy: Once the number of infected people exceeds $ I_{T} $, the media influence comes into play, and when the number of susceptible individuals is greater than $ S_{T} $, the control by quarantine of susceptible individuals is open. Furthermore, by choosing different thresholds $ I_{T} $ and $ S_{T} $ and using Filippov theory, we study the dynamic behavior of the Filippov model with respect to all possible equilibria. It is shown that the Filippov system tends to the pseudo-equilibrium on sliding mode domain or one endemic equilibrium or bistability endemic equilibria under some conditions. The regular/virtulal equilibrium bifurcations are also given. Lastly, numerical simulation results show that choosing appropriate threshold values can prevent the outbreak of influenza, which implies media coverage and quarantine of susceptible individuals can effectively restrain the transmission of influenza. The non-smooth system with logistic source can provide some new insights for the prevention and control of human influenza.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The SARS-COV-2 virus and its variants pose extraordinary challenges for public health worldwide. Timely and accurate forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic is key to sustaining interventions and policies and efficient resource allocation. Internet-based data sources have shown great potential to supplement traditional infectious disease surveillance, and the combination of different Internet-based data sources has shown greater power to enhance epidemic forecasting accuracy than using a single Internet-based data source. However, existing methods incorporating multiple Internet-based data sources only used real-time data from these sources as exogenous inputs but did not take all the historical data into account. Moreover, the predictive power of different Internet-based data sources in providing early warning for COVID-19 outbreaks has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE(S): The main aim of our study is to explore whether combining real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve the COVID-19 forecasting accuracy over the existing baseline models. A secondary aim is to explore the COVID-19 forecasting timeliness based on different Internet-based data sources. METHOD(S): We first used core terms and symptom-related keyword-based methods to extract COVID-19-related Internet-based data from December 21, 2019, to February 29, 2020. The Internet-based data we explored included 90,493,912 online news articles, 37,401,900 microblogs, and all the Baidu search query data during that period. We then proposed an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs, incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources. Our proposed model was compared with baseline models, and all the models were tested during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemics in Hubei province and the rest of mainland China separately. We also used lagged Pearson correlations for COVID-19 forecasting timeliness analysis. RESULT(S): Our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy in all 5 accuracy measures, compared with all the baseline models of both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China. In mainland China, except for Hubei, the COVID-19 epidemic forecasting accuracy differences between our proposed model (model i) and all the other baseline models were statistically significant (model 1, t198=-8.722, P<.001; model 2, t198=-5.000, P<.001, model 3, t198=-1.882, P=.06; model 4, t198=-4.644, P<.001; model 5, t198=-4.488, P<.001). In Hubei province, our proposed model's forecasting accuracy improved significantly compared with the baseline model using historical new confirmed COVID-19 case counts only (model 1, t198=-1.732, P=.09). Our results also showed that Internet-based sources could provide a 2- to 6-day earlier warning for COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION(S): Our approach incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve forecasting accuracy for epidemics of COVID-19 and its variants, which may help improve public health agencies' interventions and resource allocation in mitigating and controlling new waves of COVID-19 or other relevant epidemics.Copyright ©Jingwei Li, Wei Huang, Choon Ling Sia, Zhuo Chen, Tailai Wu, Qingnan Wang.

Offline anti-epidemic work is the main battlefield of epidemic prevention and control. However, online epidemic information prevention and control cannot be ignored. The aim of this study was to identify reliable information sources and false epidemic information, as well as early warnings of public opinion about epidemic information that may affect social stability and endanger the people's lives and property. Based on the analysis of health and medical big data, epidemic information screening and public opinion prevention and control research were decomposed into two modules. Eight characteristics were extracted from the four levels of coarse granularity, fine granularity, emotional tendency, and publisher behavior, and another regulatory feature was added, to build a false epidemic information identification model. Five early warning indicators of public opinion were selected from the macro level and the micro level to construct the early warning model of public opinion about epidemic information. Finally, an empirical analysis on COVID-19 information was conducted using big data analysis technology.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {As global public health is under threat by the 2019-nCoV and a potential new wave of large-scale epidemic outbreak and spread is looming, an imminent question to ask is what the optimal strategy of epidemic prevention and control (P&C) measures would be, especially in terms of the timing of enforcing aggressive policy response so as to maximize health efficacy and to contain pandemic spread. Based on the current global pandemic statistic data, here we developed a logistic probability function configured SEIR model to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern under different "anticipate- or delay-to-activate" policy response scenarios in containing the pandemic. We found that the potential positive effects of stringent pandemic P&C measures would be almost canceled out in case of significantly delayed action, whereas a partially procrastinatory wait-and-see control policy may still be able to contribute to containing the degree of epidemic spread although its effectiveness may be significantly compromised compared to a scenario of early intervention coupled with stringent P&C measures. A laissez-faire policy adopted by the government and health authority to tackling the uncertainly of COVID19-type pandemic development during the early stage of the outbreak turns out to be a high risk strategy from optimal control perspective, as significant damages would be produced as a consequence.Copyright © 2021 Li, Ye, Zhou, Zhang and Chen.},

Faced with the rapid spread of the Delta strain and its multiple hidden transmission chains, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, as the largest comprehensive tertiary hospital in Northwest China, has successfully applied the 4R crisis management theory to prevent the pandemic spread and continue the clinic work as well. Balancing of epidemic prevention and medical service with scientific, orderly and standardized procedures has been achieved. Hence, we have contributed to the "The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University model" for controlling the epidemic and restoring normal production and life as soon as possible under the guidance and command of the National Health Commission and provincial and municipal health administrative institutions at all levels. The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University has improved the present management system and enhanced its management level amid epidemic prevention and control. This paper aims to provide new epidemic prevention experience under the changeable environment by explaining and summarizing our theoretical basis, operation mode and practical effects of our management system.Copyright © 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences).

   abstract = {Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide, which causes a considerable economic burden on hospitals and other healthcare costs. Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an effective way to prevent influenza outbreaks and protect public health. Traditional autoregressive(AR) methods and new deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) have been actively studied to solve the problem. Most existing studies focus on the short-term prediction of influenza. Recently, Transformer models show superior performance in capturing long-range dependency than RNN models. In this paper, we develop a Transformer-based model, which utilizes the potential of the Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. To fuse information from data of different sources and capture the spatial dependency, we design a sources selection module based on measuring curve similarity. Our model is compared with the widely used AR models and RNN-based models on USA and Japan datasets. Results show that our approach provides approximate performance in short-term forecasting and better performance in long-term forecasting. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Forecasting of COVID-19 cases daily and weekly has been one of the challenges posed to governments and the health sector globally. To facilitate informed public health decisions, the concerned parties rely on short-Term daily projections generated via predictive modeling. We calibrate stochastic variants of growth models and the standard susceptible-infectious-removed model into 1 Bayesian framework to evaluate and compare their short-Term forecasts. Result(s): We implement rolling-origin cross-validation to compare the short-Term forecasting performance of the stochastic epidemiological models and an autoregressive moving average model across 20 countries that had the most confirmed COVID-19 cases as of August 22, 2020. Conclusion(s): None of the models proved to be a gold standard across all regions, while all outperformed the autoregressive moving average model in terms of the accuracy of forecast and interpretability.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Importance: Sustained spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in cities in China could inform the planning of local health care resources., Objectives: To describe and compare the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2 cities in China to estimate the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if an outbreak equivalent to that in Wuhan occurs., Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020., Exposures: Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread., Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of critical and severe patient-days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period., Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 19425 patients (24.5 per 10000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence., Conclusions and Relevance: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local health care systems in US cities.},

   journal = {Psychology research and behavior management},
   volume = {16},
   pages = {971-987},
   abstract = {Purpose: This study assesses how various social information influence individuals' money donation behaviors towards charitable funds against the COVID-19 pandemic at different stages of the pandemic. It also explores the mediating role of social anxiety and the moderating role of self-control., Materials and Methods: This three-wave study was conducted with online survey experiments using convenience sampling at the pandemic's outbreak stage (April-June 2020), trough stage (February-March 2021), and resurgence stage (May 2022) in China. The nudge power of social information was measured by whether participants changed their initial money donation decisions after informed positive or negative social information. Self-report scales were used to measure levels of social anxiety (Social Interaction Anxiety Scale) and self-control (Self-Control Scale). The final data set included 1371 participants from 26 provinces of mainland China. Stata medeff package and SPSS PROCESS were used to analyze the data., Results: Individuals' initial donation behaviors did not fluctuate along with the pandemic status, but the nudge effect of social information did. From outbreak stage to trough stage, the nudge power of positive social information significantly declined, but did not significantly change again at the resurgence stage. By contrast, the nudge power of negative social information did not significantly differ between outbreak and trough stage but did significantly increase at the resurgence stage. Social anxiety played a significant mediating role in the relationship between COVID-19 status and power of social information. Moreover, self-control moderated the direct effect of COVID-19 status on power of social information and the indirect effect via social anxiety., Conclusion: Our findings enrich research on the nudge power variation of social information on individuals' donation behaviors along with the pandemic status and its potential psychological influence factors. This study also helps guide organizations to better design and carry out social information nudge mechanism. Copyright © 2023 Li et al.},

   journal = {PeerJ},
   pages = {e11629},
   abstract = {Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Method(s): We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. This is a city level model that simulates the epidemic situation from the perspective of population mobility. Result(s): Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease healing time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P x (-0.273 + 0.009I + 0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) x (1 + V).Copyright 2021 Li et al.},

   journal = {Annals of operations research},
   pages = {1-40},
   abstract = {This paper explores the effectiveness of predictors, including nine economic policy uncertainty indicators, four market sentiment indicators and two financial stress indices, in predicting the realized volatility of the S&P 500 index. We employ the MIDAS-RV framework and construct the MIDAS-LASSO model and its regime switching extension (namely, MS-MIDAS-LASSO). First, among all considered predictors, the economic policy uncertainty indices (especially the equity market volatility index) and the CBOE volatility index are the most noteworthy predictors. Although the CBOE volatility index has the best predictive ability for stock market volatility, its predictive ability has weakened during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the equity market volatility index is best during this period. Second, the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model has the best predictive performance compared to other competing models. The superior forecasting performance of this model is robust, even when distinguishing between high- and low-volatility periods. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model even outperforms the traditional LASSO strategy and its regime switching extension. Furthermore, the superior predictive performance of this model has not changed with the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.

   abstract = {There is increasing recognition of the usefulness of mathematical models in informing public health intervention strategies and policymakers on how to address different epidemics. Over the years, we have seen many models testing different interventions to prevent the spread of HIV. Lately, mathematical models have been used to assess interventions focused on controlling the spread of COVID-19 and, more recently, of Mpox. However, as we will show in this presentation, we saw considerable pressure to fast produce mathematical models for COVID-19 to inform on different policies to control the spread of this disease. Consequently, we saw that several of these models missed the mark, and others, although not perfect, were useful in making predictions based on different interventions. In this presentation, I will describe how mathematical models have informed public health Interventions. We will provide an overview of the use of mathematical models to prevent HIV, COVID-19 and Mpox. I will propose a list of criteria to evaluate and write publications involving mathematical models. Finally, I will discuss some of the lessons learned for properly using mathematical models and interpreting results and propose a pathway moving forward.},

   abstract = {Background: We sought to develop and prospectively validate a dynamic model that incorporates changes in biomarkers to predict rapid clinical deterioration in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Method(s): We established a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients aged >=18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using electronic health records (EHR) from a large integrated care delivery network in Massachusetts including >40 facilities from March to November 2020. A total of 71 factors, including time-varying vital signs and laboratory findings during hospitalization were screened. We used elastic net regression and tree-based scan statistics for variable selection to predict rapid deterioration, defined as progression by two levels of a published severity scale in the next 24 h. The development cohort included the first 70% of patients identified chronologically in calendar time; the latter 30% served as the validation cohort. A cut-off point was estimated to alert clinicians of high risk of imminent clinical deterioration. Result(s): Overall, 3706 patients (2587 in the development and 1119 in the validation cohort) met the eligibility criteria with a median of 6 days of follow-up. Twenty-four variables were selected in the final model, including 16 dynamic changes of laboratory results or vital signs. Area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79-0.82) in the development set and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.78) in the validation set. The model was well calibrated (slope = 0.84 and intercept = -0.07 on the calibration plot in the validation set). The estimated cut-off point, with a positive predictive value of 83%, was 0.78. Conclusion(s): Our prospectively validated dynamic prognostic model demonstrated temporal generalizability in a rapidly evolving pandemic and can be used to inform day-to-day treatment and resource allocation decisions based on dynamic changes in biophysiological factors.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {The purpose of the pilot survey was to understand current practice patterns and responses to the Patient-Driven Groupings Model and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in home health occupational therapy care. Fifty home health occupational therapy practitioners from 27 states in the United States completed the survey. Descriptive analysis was used to organize and summarize survey responses. The survey items on practice patterns included assessment tools, treatment approaches, and care coordination with physical therapy colleagues. The most reported assessment of occupational performance was the Barthel Index. The common treatment approaches included activities of daily living retraining, energy conservation, and functional mobility and transfer. The majority of respondents (n = 44) communicated with their physical therapy colleagues at least once a week. The communications were often related to scheduling and changes in a patient's condition. Seventy percent of practitioners experienced a reduction in home visits during the recent Medicare payment reform and the pandemic. These practitioners perceived that some patients might have been discharged from home health care prematurely. Additional studies to investigate the impact of policy changes and the pandemic on therapy intensity and patients' functional outcomes are warranted.Copyright © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Three research questions (RQs) were investigated. Study 1 (longitudinal sub-sample) explored whether medical students had higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic compared with a pre-pandemic period (RQ1) and what variables were associated with these conditions during the pandemic adjusting for baseline levels (RQ2). Study 2 (repeated cross-sectional data) aimed to examine whether medical students had higher levels of these conditions during the pandemic compared with their same-year peers during a pre-pandemic period (RQ3). In Study 1, higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress were shown during the pandemic (RQ1). Multivariable models highlighted associations between poor mental health and worsening of the judgment of medical school choice, worsened psychological condition due to the pandemic, economic repercussions due to the pandemic, and baseline levels of symptoms (RQ2). In Study 2, our findings reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic, also adjusting for other variables (RQ3). In conclusion, depressive symptoms and stress were greater during the pandemic. The most relevant variables were pandemic-related items and medical school choice judgment.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic revealed many vulnerabilities of the contemporary built environment along with limited preparedness and low efficiency in mitigating unexpected and unprecedented challenges. This article discusses the efficiency and responsiveness of basic hospital spatial layouts in three different scenarios: normal operation; the segregation of a large number of patients and still providing them with access to emergency healthcare, typical for a pandemic; and a sudden, extremely high number of admissions typical for compound disasters and terrorist attacks. A set of parameters and a method for general adaptability assessment (GAAT) that can be used as a tool in decision-making processes as well as evaluation of both existing facilities and the new models for resilient hospitals resulting from the experience of the pandemic are proposed. The paper emphasizes why factors among which adaptability, convertibility, and scalability should be at the very core of hospital development and management strategies. It also discusses new models of adaptable healthcare facilities that enable day-to-day operations to continue alongside a pandemic, and other emergency scenarios.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Objectives: To investigate how information communication technology (ICT) factors relate to the use of telemedicine by older people in Ireland during the pandemic in 2020. Furthermore, the paper tested whether the supply of primary care, measured by General Practitioner's (GP) accessibility, influenced people's telemedicine options. Method(s): Based on 2 waves from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative sample, multivariate logistic models were applied to examine the association between pre-pandemic use of ICTs and telemedicine usage (GP, pharmacist, hospital doctor), controlling for a series of demographic, health, and socioeconomic characteristics. Result(s): Previously reported having Internet access was a statistically positive predictor for telemedicine usage. The availability of high-speed broadband Internet did not exhibit a statistical association. The association was more prominent among those under 70 years old and non-Dublin urban areas. People with more chronic conditions, poorer mental health, and private health insurance had higher odds of using telemedicine during the period of study. No clear pattern between telemedicine use and differential geographic access to GP was found. Discussion(s): The important role of ICT access and frequent engagement with the Internet in encouraging telemedicine usage among older adults was evidenced. Conclusion(s): Internet access was a strong predictor for telemedicine usage. We found no evidence of a substitution or complementary relationship between telemedicine and in-person primary care access.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza has major implications for healthcare services as outbreaks often lead to high activity levels in health systems. Being able to predict when such outbreaks occur is vital. Mathematical models have extensively been used to predict epidemics of infectious diseases such as seasonal influenza and to assess effectiveness of control strategies. Availability of comprehensive and reliable datasets used to parametrize these models is limited. In this paper we combine a unique epidemiological dataset collected in Malta through General Practitioners (GPs) with a novel method using cross-sectional surveys to study seasonal influenza dynamics in Malta in 2014-2016, to include social dynamics and self-perception related to seasonal influenza. METHOD(S): Two cross-sectional public surveys (n=406 per survey) were performed by telephone across the Maltese population in 2014-15 and 2015-16 influenza seasons. Survey results were compared with incidence data (diagnosed seasonal influenza cases) collected by GPs in the same period and with Google Trends data for Malta. Information was collected on whether participants recalled their health status in past months, occurrences of influenza symptoms, hospitalisation rates due to seasonal influenza, seeking GP advice, and other medical information. RESULT(S): We demonstrate that cross-sectional surveys are a reliable alternative data source to medical records. The two surveys gave comparable results, indicating that the level of recollection among the public is high. Based on two seasons of data, the reporting rate in Malta varies between 14 and 22%. The comparison with Google Trends suggests that the online searches peak at about the same time as the maximum extent of the epidemic, but the public interest declines and returns to background level. We also found that the public intensively searched the Internet for influenza-related terms even when number of cases was low. CONCLUSION(S): Our research shows that a telephone survey is a viable way to gain deeper insight into a population's self-perception of influenza and its symptoms and to provide another benchmark for medical statistics provided by GPs and Google Trends. The information collected can be used to improve epidemiological modelling of seasonal influenza and other infectious diseases, thus effectively contributing to public health.Copyright © 2021.

   journal = {EClinicalMedicine},
   volume = {27},
   pages = {100539},
   abstract = {Background: The lack of evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic decisions during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a unique scenario of clinical decision making which is worth to analyze. We aim to identify the drivers of therapeutic aggressiveness during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): This cross-sectional worldwide survey (conducted April 12 to 19, 2020) was aimed at physicians who managed patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Treatment preferences were collected in five different clinical scenarios. We used multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression to identify variables that were associated with the use of more aggressive therapies. Finding(s): The survey was completed by 852 physicians from 44 different specialties and 29 countries. The heterogeneity of therapeutic decisions increased as the clinical scenario worsened. Factors associated with aggressive therapeutic decisions were higher self-perceived expertise (high vs. null, OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.31-2.89), perceived quality of COVID-19 publications (high vs. null, OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.17-3.16), and female sex (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.02-1.33). Conversely, Infectious Diseases specialty, Latin American and North American origin, lower confidence in the treatments chosen, and having published articles indexed in PubMed as the first-author were associated with the use of less aggressive therapies. Interpretation(s): Our study provides insight into the drivers of the decision-making process during a new and extreme health emergency. Different factors including the perceived expertise and quality of publications, gender, geographic origin, medical specialty and implication in medical research influenced this process. The clinical severity attenuated the physician's tolerance for uncertainty. Funding(s): No funding was required.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

   journal = {Cureus},
   volume = {15},
   number = {10},
   pages = {e46476},
   abstract = {Background and objective The global HIV epidemic has evolved in the past 30 years with a decline in mortality and morbidity and improved survival since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, this has brought on new challenges through the emergence of non-communicable disease (NCD) as a pandemic at par with, if not more serious than, HIV, and patients well maintained on ART are now faced with the increased risk of developing NCDs such as hypertension, which also require lifelong therapy. This study was designed to determine the burden of hypertension in patients under HIV care in Masvingo province, Zimbabwe. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in six districts of Masvingo province based on the data collected from the electronic Patient Monitoring System (ePMS), along with an analysis of secondary data. Of the 94,821 records gathered, 877 met the inclusion criteria to be included in the study. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Stata statistical software and statistical analysis was performed using the chi2 test. Results The study revealed a hypertension prevalence of 7.64% among the 877 patients analyzed and the independent risk factors for the development of hypertension were determined to be the age of patients, with a one-year increase in age resulting in an 8% increase in the risk of developing hypertension, and the duration on ART, with a one-year increase on ART duration increasing the risk of hypertension by 27%, and an increase in BMI by a factor of 1 increasing the risk of getting hypertension by 9%. Conclusion Our findings showed that there are patients who have both hypertension and HIV on ART care, and they would need to be managed for both. There is a need for improved data collection of important variables that improve the quality of care of clients. Clinical management of HIV needs to evolve with the evolving needs of patients and NCD care has to be factored in. Copyright © 2023, Masunda et al.},

   pages = {OC21-OC25},
   abstract = {Introduction: The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires adaptation of the care delivery process. Since the point of care ultrasonography (USG) is an essential diagnostic tool that aids in making clinical management decisions in a short time, wider adoption of USG by general health practitioners dealing with COVID-19 patients across the country could improve the care delivery process in a pandemic scenario. A simple diagnostic algorithm of USG limited to two echo views was proposed for ease of training and broader adoption of the technique. The study analysed the efficacy of focused USG in COVID-19 using this approach for diagnosing and managing critically ill COVID-19 patients. Aim(s): To determine the concordance between ultrasonographic diagnosis based on a focused algorithm and clinical diagnosis in COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 58 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital, in Kerala, India from October 2020 to March 2021. The inclusion criteria were age 18 years or above, hypoxaemia (SpO2<94%) and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg). Apical four chamber and subcostal views were captured using a phased array probe (1.7-4 Hz). The cause of hypoxaemia or hypotension was diagnosed based on an algorithm constructed with Echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis was made, laboratory data, and chest radiograph. Agreement between ultrasonographic and clinical diagnosis was assessed using the Cohen's Kappa inter-rater coefficient. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 was used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of the population was 65.6+/-17.3 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.5:1. Clinical diagnoses were categorised into six groups. The agreement between the ultrasonographic and the clinical diagnoses was substantial (95.1%), with Kappa 0.905 (0.851-0.959). The median time taken for image acquisition was 30 seconds (IQR 30, 60). Additional views performed for lungs and vessels did not change the clinical diagnosis or management. Conclusion(s): The proposed technique is simple yet effective for clinical management decisions. It has the potential for improving patient care delivery on a larger scale, since it reduces the time lag in instituting therapy.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

   abstract = {Importance: The variability in timing of middle and secondary school reopenings during the 2020 to 2021 school year in the US presents an opportunity to examine the associations of different approaches to in-person education with changes in community COVID-19 incidence. Early studies on this topic have reached mixed conclusions and may be biased by unmeasured confounders. Objective(s): To estimate the association of in-person vs virtual instruction for students at the sixth grade level or above with county-level COVID-19 incidence in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included matched pairs of counties resuming school programs with in-person vs virtual instruction, drawn from 229 US counties that contained a single public school district and with county populations exceeding 100000 residents. Counties that contained 1 single public school district and reopened in-person schooling for students at the sixth grade level or above during the fall of 2020 were matched 1-to-1 with counties whose school district reopened with only virtual instruction, based on geographic proximity, population-level demographic factors, the resumption of school district-level fall sports activity, and baseline county COVID-19 incidence rates. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to November 2022. Exposures: In-person instruction for students at the sixth grade level or above resuming between August 1 and October 31, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level daily COVID-19 incidence per 100000 residents. Result(s): The inclusion criteria and subsequent matching algorithm led to the identification of 51 pairs of matched counties among 79 total unique counties. Exposed counties had a median (IQR) of 141840 (81441-241910) residents each, and unexposed counties had a median (IQR) of 131412 (89011-278666) residents each. County schools with in-person vs virtual instruction had similar daily COVID-19 case incidence within the first 4 weeks after in-person reopening, but counties with in-person instruction had higher daily incidence beyond 4 weeks. Daily case incidence per 100000 residents among counties with in-person instruction, compared with counties with virtual instruction, was higher at 6 weeks (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.00-1.55]) and at 8 weeks after (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.06-1.62]). This outcome was also concentrated in counties where schools provided full rather than hybrid instructional models. Conclusions and Relevance: In a cohort study of matched pairs of counties that reopened with in-person vs virtual instruction at the secondary school level in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, counties with in-person school instructional models early in the COVID-19 pandemic experienced increases in county-level COVID-19 incidence at 6 and 8 weeks after in-person reopening, compared with counties with virtual instructional models.Copyright © 2023 American Medical Association.

This paper analyzes the specific behavior of travelers commuting to work or school during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a sample of 2000 respondents from two countries. We obtained data from an online survey, applying multinomial regression analysis. The results demonstrate the multinomial model with an accuracy of almost 70% that estimates the most used modes of transport (walking, public transport, car) based on independent variables. The respondents preferred the car as the most frequently used means of transport. However, commuters without car prefer public transport to walking. This prediction model could be a tool for planning and creating transport policy, especially in exceptional cases such as the limitation of public transport activities. Therefore, predicting travel behavior is essential for policymaking based on people's travel needs.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Rapid, continuous implementation of credible scientific findings and regulatory approvals is often slow in large, diverse health systems. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a new threat to this common "slow to learn and adapt" model in healthcare. We describe how the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) committed to a rapid learning health system (LHS) model to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: A treatment cohort study was conducted among 11 429 hospitalized patients (pediatric/adult) from 22 hospitals (PA, NY) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (March 19, 2020 - June 6, 2021). Sociodemographic and clinical data were captured from UPMC electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Patients were grouped into four time-defined patient "waves" based on nadir of daily hospital admissions, with wave 3 (September 20, 2020 - March 10, 2021) split at its zenith due to high volume with steep acceleration and deceleration. Outcomes included changes in clinical practice (eg, use of corticosteroids, antivirals, and other therapies) in relation to timing of internal system analyses, scientific publications, and regulatory approvals, along with 30-day rate of mortality over time., Results: The mean (SD) daily number of admissions across hospitals was 26 (29) with a maximum 7-day moving average of 107 patients. System-wide implementation of the use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab occurred within days of release of corresponding seminal publications and regulatory actions. After adjustment for differences in patient clinical profiles over time, each month of hospital admission was associated with an estimated 5% lower odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.97, P < .001)., Conclusions: In our large LHS, near real-time changes in clinical management of COVID-19 patients happened promptly as scientific publications and regulatory approvals occurred throughout the pandemic. Alongside these changes, patients with COVID-19 experienced lower adjusted 30-day mortality following hospital admission over time. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background/aims: Mortality forecasts associated with COVID-19 pandemic stressed a need to prepare adults with advanced disease for possible severe illness and engage with Advance Care Planning (ACP). We aimed to examine ACP engagement and activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): A retrospective non-interventional cohort study, comparing the creation, content and use of Coordinate My Care (CMC) records that include an ACP component, in London, prior to and during the onset of COVID-19. Records for people aged 18+, created and published in prepandemic period (2018-2019) and 'wave 1' (W1) of COVID-19 (20/03/20- 04/07/20) were extracted. Demographics, ACP-related content and the use of CMC records created were analysed and compared using standard descriptive statistics. Result(s): 56,343 records were included, 35,108 from the pre-pandemic period and 21,235 records from W1. The average records created each week rose by 296.9% (P<0.005) in W1. There were fewer records in W1 for those aged 80 years (60.8% vs 64.9% pre-pandemic, P<0.005) and who had WHO performance status of 4 (34.8% vs 44.2% pre pandemic, P<0.005). More people who created records during W1 had an estimated prognosis of at least a year (73.3% vs 53.0% pre-pandemic, P<0.005), were "For Resuscitation" (38.2% vs 29.8% pre-pandemic, P<0.005) and had a Ceiling of Treatment of "Full Active Treatment" (32.4% vs 25.7%, P<0.005). More people in W1 listed hospital as their preferred place of care (PPC) and preferred place of death (PPD) (PPC: 13.3% vs 5.8% pre-pandemic, P<0.005. PPD: 14.0% vs 7.9%, P<0.005). Average monthly non-urgent and urgent record views rose by 320.3% (P=0.02) and 154.3% (P=0.01) in W1. Conclusion(s): A large uptake in engagement with ACP is demonstrated during the 1st wave of the pandemic. An increase in use among younger, more independent patients with longer prognoses, with a higher preference for hospital care creating records in W1 compared to before the pandemic, suggests heightened awareness and provision of ACP at this time.},

   abstract = {Objectives The threat of a pandemic, over and above the disease itself, may have significant and broad effects on a healthcare system. We aimed to describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (during a relatively low transmission period) and associated societal restrictions on presentations, admissions and outpatient visits. Design We compared hospital activity in 2020 with the preceding 5 years, 2015-2019, using a retrospective cohort study design. Setting Quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants Emergency department presentations, hospital admissions and outpatient visits from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2020, n=896 934 episodes of care. Intervention In Australia, the initial peak COVID-19 phase was March-April. Primary and secondary outcome measures Separate linear regression models were fitted to estimate the impact of the pandemic on the number, type and severity of emergency presentations, hospital admissions and outpatient visits. Results During the peak COVID-19 phase (March and April 2020), there were marked reductions in emergency presentations (10 389 observed vs 14 678 expected; 29% reduction; p<0.05) and hospital admissions (5972 observed vs 8368 expected; 28% reduction; p<0.05). Stroke (114 observed vs 177 expected; 35% reduction; p<0.05) and trauma (1336 observed vs 1764 expected; 24% reduction; p<0.05) presentations decreased; acute myocardial infarctions were unchanged. There was an increase in the proportion of hospital admissions requiring intensive care (7.0% observed vs 6.0% expected; p<0.05) or resulting in death (2.2% observed vs 1.5% expected; p<0.05). Outpatient attendances remained similar (30 267 observed vs 31 980 expected; 5% reduction; not significant) but telephone/telehealth consultations increased from 2.5% to 45% (p<0.05) of total consultations. Conclusions Although case numbers of COVID-19 were relatively low in Australia during the first 6 months of 2020, the impact on hospital activity was profound.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

   abstract = {Objectives: Many prediction models for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed. External validation is mandatory before implementation in the intensive care unit (ICU). We selected and validated prognostic models in the Euregio Intensive Care COVID (EICC) cohort. Study Design and Setting: In this multinational cohort study, routine data from COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs within the Euregio Meuse-Rhine were collected from March to August 2020. COVID-19 models were selected based on model type, predictors, outcomes, and reporting. Furthermore, general ICU scores were assessed. Discrimination was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and calibration by calibration-in-the-large and calibration plots. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool results. Result(s): 551 patients were admitted. Mean age was 65.4 +/- 11.2 years, 29% were female, and ICU mortality was 36%. Nine out of 238 published models were externally validated. Pooled AUCs were between 0.53 and 0.70 and calibration-in-the-large between -9% and 6%. Calibration plots showed generally poor but, for the 4C Mortality score and Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) score, moderate calibration. Conclusion(s): Of the nine prognostic models that were externally validated in the EICC cohort, only two showed reasonable discrimination and moderate calibration. For future pandemics, better models based on routine data are needed to support admission decision-making.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)},

   journal = {International journal of nursing studies advances},
   volume = {6},
   pages = {100194},
   abstract = {Background: Registered nurses working on the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic encountered significant challenges, including exposure to critical incidents. Critical incidents refer to sudden unexpected clinical events that surpass an individual's ability to cope, leading to considerable psychological distress, which could potentially result in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Research has shown a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among healthcare workers, particularly those in close contact with COVID-19 patients., Objective: To assess the levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms among registered nurses in relation to exposure to working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as how much their work was affected by the pandemic, re-deployment, working hours hindering sufficient recovery between shifts and critical incidents., Design: Cross sectional study., Settings: The registered nurses working in multiple health care services covering all 21 geographic regions in Sweden., Participants: A total of 1,923 registered nurses, who are part of a Swedish national cohort and have been followed since their nursing education, were invited to participate in a survey in late September 2021 (15 to 19 years post graduation)., Methods: The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, unpaired t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance. Cohen's d was employed to quantify differences in mean levels between subgroups., Results: The response rate were 56.5 %. Over 50 % of experienced registered nurses reported significant disruptions to their work environments. In total, 85 % of registered nurses were exposed to at least one critical incident in their work during the pandemic, with 60 % facing organisational changes and nearly 50 % experiencing emotionally distressing situations. The exposure to work situations involving critical incidents consistently demonstrated strong associations with higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms compared to those not exposed, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to high., Conclusions: This study underscores the profound impact that working conditions, such as redeployment and exposure to critical incidents, have on the mental health of registered nurses. We offer valuable insights into registered nurses' pandemic-related challenges, highlighting the need for support and interventions to prevent and manage critical incidents, ultimately promoting their well-being. We also highlight the significance of thorough workforce readiness planning for future pandemics and other challenging health care scenarios, such as staff shortage. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ontario stroke prevention clinics primarily held in-person visits before the COVID-19 pandemic and then had to shift to a home-based teleconsultation delivery model using telephone or video to provide services during the pandemic. This change may have affected service quality and patient experiences., OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to understand patient satisfaction with Ontario stroke prevention clinics' rapid shift to a home-based teleconsultation delivery model used during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research question explores explanatory factors affecting patient satisfaction., METHODS: Using a cross-sectional service performance model, we surveyed patients who received telephone or video consultations at 2 Ontario stroke prevention clinics in 2021. This survey included closed- and open-ended questions. We used logistic regression and qualitative content analysis to understand factors affecting patient satisfaction with the quality of home-based teleconsultation services., RESULTS: The overall response rate to the web survey was 37.2% (128/344). The quantitative analysis was based on 110 responses, whereas the qualitative analysis included 97 responses. Logistic regression results revealed that responsiveness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.034, 95% CI 0.006-0.188; P<.001) and empathy (AOR 0.116, 95% CI 0.017-0.800; P=.03) were significant factors negatively associated with low satisfaction (scores of 1, 2, or 3 out of 5). The only characteristic positively associated with low satisfaction was when survey consent was provided by the substitute decision maker (AOR 6.592, 95% CI 1.452-29.927; P=.02). In the qualitative content analysis, patients with both low and high global satisfaction scores shared the same factors of service dissatisfaction (assurance, reliability, and empathy). The main subcategories associated with dissatisfaction were missing clinical activities, inadequate communication, administrative process issues, and absence of personal connection. Conversely, the high-satisfaction group offered more positive feedback on assurance, reliability, and empathy, as well as on having a competent clinician, appropriate patient selection, and excellent communication and empathy skills., CONCLUSIONS: The insights gained from this study can be considered when designing home-based teleconsultation services to enhance patient experiences in stroke prevention care.

   abstract = {Background COVID-19 has inundated the entire world disrupting the lives of millions of people. The pandemic has stressed the healthcare system of India impacting the psychological status and functioning of health care workers. The aim of this study is to determine the burnout levels and factors associated with the risk of psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCW) engaged in the management of COVID 19 in India. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2020 to 30 November 2020 by telephonic interviews using a web-based Google form. Health facilities and community centres from 12 cities located in 10 states were selected for data collection. Data on sociodemographic and occupation-related variables like age, sex, type of family, income, type of occupation, hours of work and income were obtained was obtained from 967 participants, including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, emergency response teams, lab personnel, and others directly involved in COVID 19 patient care. Levels of psychological distress was assessed by the General health Questionnaire -GHQ-5 and levels of burnout was assessed using the ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the risk of psychological distress. The third quartile values of the three subscales of burnout viz EE, DP and PA were used to identify burnout profiles of the healthcare workers. Results Overall, 52.9% of the participants had the risk of psychological distress that needed further evaluation. Risk of psychological distress was significantly associated with longer hours of work (>=8 hours a day) (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI(1.66-3.41), income>=20000(AOR = 1.74, 95% CI, (1.16-2.6); screening of COVID-19 patients (AOR = 1.63 95% CI (1.09-2.46), contact tracing (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI (1.1-3.81), High Emotional exhaustion score (EE >=16) (AOR = 4.41 95% CI (3.14-6.28) and High Depersonalisation score (DP>=7) (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.28-2.51)). About 4.7% of the HCWs were overextended (EE>18); 6.5% were disengaged (DP>8) and 9.7% HCWs were showing signs of burnout (high on all three dimensions). Conclusion The study has identified key factors that could have been likely triggers for psychological distress among healthcare workers who were engaged in management of COVID cases in India. The study also demonstrates the use of GHQ-5 and ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire as important tools to identify persons at risk of psychological distress and occurrence of burnout symptoms respectively. The findings provide useful guide to planning interventions to mitigate mental health problems among HCW in future epidemic/pandemic scenarios in the country.Copyright: © 2022 Menon et al.

   pages = {106987},
   abstract = {Background: Health systems around the world continue to navigate through operational challenges surfaced by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; these have implications for access to healthcare. In this study, we estimate the prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare during the pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland; a country with a universal and mandatory private health insurance coverage. Method(s): Participants from a randomly selected population-based sample of the adult population living in the Canton of Geneva completed an online socio-demographic and lifestyle questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021. The prevalence and reasons for forgoing healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined descriptively, and logistic regression models were used to assess determinants for forgoing healthcare. Result(s): The study included 5397 participants, among which 8.0% reported having forgone healthcare since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; participants with a disadvantaged financial situation (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.56-2.65), and those reporting an average (OR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.94-3.31) or poor health (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: 2.39-7.67) were more likely to forgo healthcare. The most common reasons to forgo healthcare were appointment cancellations by healthcare providers (53.9%), fear of infection (35.3%), and personal organizational issues (11.1%). Conclusion(s): Our paper highlights the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to healthcare and identifies population sub-groups at-risk for forgoing healthcare. These results necessitate public health efforts to ensure equitable and accessible healthcare as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   title = {INEQUALITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH AMONG CHILDREN AGED 5-11 BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE UK: FINDINGS FROM THE UK HOUSEHOLD LONGITUDINAL STUDY},
   journal = {Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health},
   volume = {76},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   pages = {A14-A15},
   abstract = {Background There are concerns that social mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to declines in child mental health and widened mental health inequalities, because affluent families had greater access to resources to cope with restrictions. We investigated how existing inequalities in child mental health changed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using population-representative longitudinal data. Methods Data were from 14,854 observations of 7,929 children in the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Child mental health measures using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were taken at ages 5 and 8 during annual surveys between 2011 and 2019 and from children aged 5-11 over three waves of data collection between April 2020 and March 2021. In order to estimate the impact of the pandemic on inequalities, we modelled mental health using a mixed effects generalised linear model with an indicator for surveys taken during the pandemic, and interactions between the pandemic and sex, ethnicity, family structure, parent education, employment, household income and area deprivation on mental health. Models were weighted for survey design and nonresponse, and adjusted for age, year (linear trend), and sex. Results Childhood mental health declined between 2011 and 2021. In most cases advantaged groups (including children with coupled parents, highly educated parents, employed parents and higher income households) experienced a more rapid decline in mental health during COVID-19 than less advantaged groups, leading to narrowing of inequalities. Before the pandemic, for example, not having an employed parent was associated with a 1.63 point higher SDQ score (95% confidence intervals: 0.90 to 2.35), while during the pandemic this gap reduced to -0.50 points (95% CI: -1.70 to 0.69). Disadvantages related to male sex and living in deprived areas were maintained during COVID-19, while the mental health advantage of ethnic minorities increased. These patterns were apparent for both internalising and externalising mental health symptoms, and when SDQ scores were treated as a binary outcome indicating mental health difficulties. Conclusion UK children have experienced a 'levelling down' of mental health during COVID-19, with mental health becoming worse overall, and children from more advantaged groups experiencing the most rapid declines. Understanding what has created this pattern will be important for developing interventions and policies to improve child mental health in all sociodemographic groups, and prevent inequalities becoming re-established during the pandemic recovery.},

   title = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on postpartum contraception planning},
   journal = {American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM},
   volume = {3},
   number = {5},
   pages = {100412},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adjustment of obstetrical delivery models including fewer antenatal appointments and increased use of telehealth. We hypothesized that an increase in telemedicine and a decrease in antepartum visits owing to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decreased proportion of people with a postpartum contraception plan at the time of the birth-hospitalization admission and a reduced uptake of top-tier forms of contraception at birth-hospitalization admission and discharge, and the routine postpartum visit, which has otherwise been increasing in recent years.1,2 STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study comparing a randomly selected sample of people giving birth at a large, tertiary referral center during a regional "shelter in place" order, March 16, 2020, to July 31, 2020, with a previously abstracted random sample of people delivering between November 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, was conducted. This study was reviewed and approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board before its initiation. The study was powered to detect a 10% difference in the proportion of those arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan (power 80%, alpha 0.05). The final sample size included 586 people (318 in the pre-COVID cohort and 268 in the COVID cohort). Multivariable modified Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan in pre-COVID vs COVID cohorts, adjusting for age, parity, insurance status, and delivery mode. Secondary outcomes included tier of contraception plan at admission, discharge, and 6 weeks postpartum (classified by World Health Organization Tiered-Effectiveness3), attendance at postpartum visit, and whether the postpartum visit was conducted via telehealth. Tiered effectiveness was used for this study's purposes because it was hypothesized that telehealth would mostly affect the provision of top-tier forms of contraception that require in-person initiation. Fisher exact test was used to compare the secondary outcomes. RESULT(S): For the 2 cohorts, the median age was 32 years (range, 17-48 years) and median parity was 1 (range, 0-6). The majority (78%) had private insurance and most commonly identified as non-Hispanic White (38%) and Asian (36%). Baseline demographics did not differ between the cohorts. At birth-hospitalization admission, a smaller proportion of people had a postpartum contraceptive plan in the COVID cohort than in the pre-COVID cohort (73.9% vs 99.4%, adjusted risk ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.91, P<.001). A smaller proportion of people had a plan for top-tier contraception among the COVID cohort compared with the pre-COVID cohort at both admission and discharge (46.0% vs 71.0%, P<.01 and 31.0% vs 37.9%, P=.05) (Figure). More than 80% of the people attended a routine postpartum visit in both cohorts (P=.30) with 17.7% being telehealth visits in the COVID cohort compared with telehealth not being offered pre-COVID. Among those who attended their postpartum visit, the proportion discharged with a plan for interval top-tier contraception that was fulfilled was high in both groups (76.3% pre-COVID vs 71.2% post-COVID, P=.56). CONCLUSION(S): The study found a significant decrease in people arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraception plan in the months following a COVID-19 "shelter in place" order when compared with the pre-COVID cohort. It is suspected that changes in the obstetrical service models indirectly deprioritized the most effective forms of postpartum contraception because sterilization requires a signed consent before birth-hospitalization and postplacental intrauterine devices require consent before delivery.4,5 Current state legislation requiring in-person signature to consent for federally funded sterilization remains a barrier. We found that fewer individuals left with top-tier contraception than with plan on admission, especially within the COVID cohort. In addition to clinical contraindications that arise during lab r, which preclude placement of an intrauterine device in the postpartum setting, many patients requested an expedited discharge during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the prenatal care model continues, this transition to adopt virtual visits, reduce visit schedules, and expedite postpartum discharge, actualizing patients' contraceptive plans is increasingly more dependent on early inpatient provision. Maternity care providers should consider initiating postpartum contraception counseling and completing mandatory consents earlier in the antenatal period. This study is inherently limited by its retrospective nature of review and additional qualitative studies may better characterize this trend in contraceptive uptake. In the meantime, obstetrical care providers should carefully evaluate institutional barriers to postpartum contraception during this movement to telehealth.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   title = {Effectiveness of interventions without RCTs},
   journal = {Sexually Transmitted Infections},
   volume = {97},
   number = {SUPPL 1},
   pages = {A3-A4},
   abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are generally considered the gold standard for the evaluation of interventions. In an RCT, one group is randomly assigned the intervention and another group serves as a comparison group. But RCTs can be subject to loss to follow-up and non-adherence, which can create challenges for interpretation. In addition, we often cannot randomize an intervention, whether for ethical or logistical reasons. What can be done in those circumstances? In the past quarter century, the field of epidemiology has made dramatic progress in the use of causal methods to understand relationships between interventions and exposures (or risk factors) and disease or behavioral outcomes. In general, this approach allows many potential risk factors to be recast theoretically as an intervention. For example, a behavior such as condomless sex, which could never be assigned in an RCT, could be thought of as an 'intervention' or perhaps more appropriately, as the comparison to an intervention of sex with a condom. Once we reframe the question, several methods are available to account for potential biases that may arise in observational studies, including selection bias and confounding. In this session, we will consider this reframing process using examples, real and hypothetical, from the fields of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. The process typically begins with a carefully constructed causal diagram, called a directed acyclic graph or DAG. DAGs are used to outline the causal pathways related to the research question. The DAG accounts for both the specific factors and temporality of the relationships. With the DAGs in hand, we can plan the appropriate analyses for the specific research questions. Without equations or complex statistics, we will consider three commonly used analytical approaches: propensity scores, instrumental variables, and marginal structural models (epidemiology's MSM). We will also briefly consider other quasi-experimental approaches for policy evaluations.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To use national, pre- and post-pandemic electronic health records (EHR) to develop and validate a scenario-based model incorporating baseline mortality risk, infection rate (IR) and relative risk (RR) of death for prediction of excess deaths. Design(s): An EHR-based, retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Linked EHR in Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); and linked EHR and COVID-19 data in England provided in NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment (TRE). Participant(s): In the development (CPRD) and validation (TRE) cohorts, we included 3.8 million and 35.1 million individuals aged >=30 years, respectively. Main Outcome Measure(s): One-year all-cause excess deaths related to COVID-19 from March 2020 to March 2021. Result(s): From 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021, there were 127,020 observed excess deaths. Observed RR was 4.34% (95% CI, 4.31-4.38) and IR was 6.27% (95% CI, 6.26-6.28). In the validation cohort, predicted one-year excess deaths were 100,338 compared with the observed 127,020 deaths with a ratio of predicted to observed excess deaths of 0.79. Conclusion(s): We show that a simple, parsimonious model incorporating baseline mortality risk, one-year IR and RR of the pandemic can be used for scenario-based prediction of excess deaths in the early stages of a pandemic. Our analyses show that EHR could inform pandemic planning and surveillance, despite limited use in emergency preparedness to date. Although infection dynamics are important in the prediction of mortality, future models should take greater account of underlying conditions.Copyright © 2022, The Royal Society of Medicine.},

Here, the correlation between current or prior demographic, social and health related characteristics, including psychosocial factors with perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic assessed by questionnaire during the early pandemic period is evaluated among 770 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In multinomial logistic regression models participants with higher pre-pandemic personal mastery, a construct related to self-efficacy, were more likely to report "both positive and negative" impact of the pandemic than a solely "negative" impact (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.29-3.65). Higher perceived stress and frequent contact with family prior to the pandemic were also associated with pandemic impact. These observations highlight the relevance of psychosocial factors in the COVID-19 pandemic experience and identify characteristics that may inform interventions in future public health crises.Copyright © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

   abstract = {Background: To estimate excess mortality for care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, exploring associations with care home characteristics. Method(s): Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1 January 2017 to 7 August 2020. Care home-level data linked with CQC care home register to identify home characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent) and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. Result(s): Up to 7 August 2020, there were 29,542 (95% CI 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95% CI 5.5 to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), to older people and/or with dementia (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.8), amongst larger (vs. small) homes (OR 13.3, 95% CI 11.5 to 15.4) and belonging to a large provider/brand (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers. Conclusion(s): To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human well-being worldwide in unforeseen ways. In early 2020, the spread of the virus left its mark on every affected country, impacting mental health by limiting daily activities and causing fatalities amidst public health strategies to mitigate its impact. The influence of COVID-19 on the quality of life (QoL) may vary between countries, underscoring the need to examine its effects on individuals and families during the mandatory home quarantine. We aimed to assess the QoL of individuals and families during home isolation by COVID-19 lockdown. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2020. We included adult partners (>=18 years) of families from Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Japan, Peru, Russia, and Venezuela. Using the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire we assess the impact of COVID-19 on their partner/family member's QoL. Result(s): The survey was completed by 466 participants (mean age = 38.59 +/- 13.75 years; females = 298) and 76% worked mostly as health professionals from South America (69.2%), Europe (18.4%), and Asia (12.4%). The WHOQOL-BREF mean score from 38.38 +/- 11.55 (range = 22.8-43.4). The average quality of life in South America (41.9 +/- 1.2) was significantly higher than that of European countries (30.9 +/- 11.5) (p = 0.002). The social relations dimension was the only one with values close to 100 (mean = 83.3) in 6/7 evaluated countries, where only Spain had a low score (41 +/- 33.12). Women had a slightly lower quality of life than men, but it was not significant (40.2 +/- 8.8 vs. 41.5 +/- 9.9, p = 0.354), while we found differences in the overall QoL between young and older, and by employment type (p < 0.05). According to family structure, we found differences on QoL between nuclear and siblings' families (p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Families from seven countries of three continents reported poor QoL during the first outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic scenario has dramatically weakened the QoL in 3/4 dimensions, where social relationships have remained high. It is important to fully address the impact of this reduced QoL on families after several waves of infection and to provide comprehensive support in the post-COVID future.Copyright © 2023 Moya-Salazar, Chiu-Higa, Jaime-Quispe, Canari, Moya-Espinoza and Contreras-Pulache.},

The differing conclusions that result from these two approaches reflect the limitations of RCT-based approaches that are compounded in scenarios, such as pandemics, where urgent decisions are required with limited evidence.},

   pages = {e044388},
   abstract = {Objective In Italy, the first diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed on 20 February 2020 in the Lombardy region. Given the rapid spread of the infection in the population, it was suggested that in Europe, and specifically in Italy, the virus had already been present in the last months of 2019. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the hypothesis on the early presence of the virus in Italy by analysing data on trends of access to emergency departments (EDs) of subjects with a diagnosis of pneumonia during the 2015-2020 period. Design Time series cohort study. Setting We collected data on visits due to pneumonia between 1 October 2015 and 31 May 2020 in all EDs of the Agency for Health Protection of Milan (ATS of Milan). Trend in the winter of 2019-2020 was compared with those in the previous 4 years in order to identify unexpected signals potentially associated with the occurrence of the pandemic. Aggregated data were analysed using a Poisson regression model adjusted for seasonality and influenza outbreaks. Primary outcome measuresa Daily pneumonia-related visits in EDs. Resultsa In the studied period, we observed 105 651 pneumonia-related ED visits. Compared with the expected, a lower occurrence was observed in January 2020, while an excess of pneumonia visits started in the province of Lodi on 21 February 2020, and almost 10 days later was observed in the remaining territory of the ATS of Milan. Overall, the peak in excess was found on 17 March 2020 (369 excess visits compared with previous years, 95% CI 353 to 383) and ended in May 2020, the administrative end of the Italian lockdown. Conclusionsa An early warning system based on routinely collected administrative data could be a feasible and low-cost strategy to monitor the actual situation of the virus spread both at local and national levels.Copyright ©},

   abstract = {Loneliness was deemed a behavioral epidemic even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent social distancing policy measures have raised concerns about increased social isolation and loneliness, especially in vulnerable populations such as military veterans. However, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on longitudinal changes in loneliness in veterans, and potential protective psychosocial factors that may mitigate loneliness in this population. We analyzed data from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3,078 US veterans before and 1-year into the pandemic. Prevalence, and risk and protective factors associated with changes in loneliness were examined. Results revealed that the prevalence of loneliness decreased over the study period-17.3% pre-pandemic to 15.9% peri-pandemic (p = 0.032). A total of 5.4% (n = 164) of veterans reported increased loneliness, 6.4% (n = 196) decreased loneliness, and 10.6% (n = 325) persistent loneliness during the pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression models indicated that not being married/partnered, and scoring lower on pre-pandemic measures of purpose in life and cognitive functioning were most strongly associated with increased loneliness. Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, unpartnered marital status, and pandemic-related social restriction and financial stressors were most strongly associated with persistent loneliness. Collectively, these results suggest that, contrary to concerns, the prevalence of loneliness subtly decreased one year into the pandemic. Veterans who are not partnered, have pre-existing psychiatric conditions, and endorse more COVID-related stressors may be at higher risk for experiencing loneliness during the pandemic. Interventions that promote social connectedness, as well as that target the aforementioned risk and protective factors, may help mitigate loneliness in veterans.Copyright © 2022},

   abstract = {This commentary elaborates on different methodological aspects complicating the interpretation of epidemiological data related to the current COVID-19 pandemic, thus preventing reliable within and across-country estimates. Firstly, an inaccuracy of epidemiological data maybe arguably be attributed to passive surveillance, a relatively long incubation period during which infected individuals can still shed high loads of virus into the surrounding environment and the very high proportion of cases not even developing signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19. The latter is also the major reason for the inappropriateness of the abused "wave"wording, which gives the idea that health system starts from scratch to respond between "peaks". Clinical data for case-management on the other hand often requires complex technology in order to merge and clean data from health care facilities. Decision-making is often further derailed by the overuse of epidemiological modeling: Precise aspects related to transmissibility, clinical course of COVID-19 and effectiveness of the public health and social measures are heavily influenced by unbeknownst and unpredictable human behaviors and modelers try to overcome missing epidemiological information by relying on poorly precise or questionable assumptions. Therefore the COVID-9 pandemic may provide a valuable opportunity to rethink how we are dealing with the very basic principles of epidemiology as well as risk communication issues related to such an unprecedented emergency situation.Copyright © 2022 Panu Napodano et al.},

   pages = {1218-1227},
   abstract = {Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised considerable concerns about increased risk for suicidal behavior among US military veterans, who already had elevated rates of suicide before the pandemic. Objective(s): To examine longitudinal changes in suicidal behavior from before the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly 10 months into the pandemic and identify risk factors and COVID-related variables associated with new-onset suicide ideation (SI). Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the first and second wave of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, conducted from November 18, 2019, to December 19, 2020. Median dates of data collection for the prepandemic and peripandemic assessments were November 21, 2019, and November 14, 2020, nearly 10 months after the start of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US. A total of 3078 US military veterans aged 22 to 99 years were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Past-year SI and suicide attempts. Result(s): In this cohort study of 3078 US veterans (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [14.7] years; 91.6% men; 79.3% non-Hispanic White veterans, 10.3% non-Hispanic Black veterans, and 6.0% Hispanic veterans), 233 (7.8%) reported past-year SI, and 8 (0.3%) reported suicide attempts at the peripandemic assessment. Past-year SI decreased from 10.6% prepandemic (95% CI, 9.6%-11.8%) to 7.8% peripandemic (95% CI, 6.9%-8.8%). A total of 82 veterans (2.6%) developed new-onset SI over the follow-up period. After adjusting for sociodemographic and military characteristics, the strongest risk factors and COVID-19-related variables for new-onset SI were low social support (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.46-5.28), suicide attempt history (OR, 6.31; 95% CI, 2.71-14.67), lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.16-4.35), past-year alcohol use disorder severity (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), COVID-19 infection (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.41-5.01), and worsening of social relationships during the pandemic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.88). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study suggest that despite grim forecasts that the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate suicidality among US military veterans, the rate of SI decreased at the population level nearly 10 months into the pandemic. Veterans who were infected with COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to report SI, which suggests the need for future research to examine the potential link between COVID-19 infection and suicidal behavior.Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

We examined the proportion of SHG members who reported drinking and their reasons for drinking during the early stages of the pandemic and the effect of nonattendance at onsite recovery meetings on drinking behavior during the early pandemic period, stratified by gender. Method(s): A national cross-sectional survey of Japanese SHG members was conducted to measure self-reported alcohol consumption, sociodemographic characteristics, AUD diagnosis, treatment status, SHG meeting attendance, membership duration, psychological distress, and health-related variables. Of 6478 SHG members, 2955 (male: n = 2678; female: n = 277; response rate: 46.7%) responded, and the responses were analyzed using a gender-stratified multivariate logistic regression model. Result(s): Most participants reported having abstained from alcohol use, while 6% of the respondents reported having consumed alcohol during the early stages of the pandemic. The proportion of "drinkers" among women (10.5%) was significantly higher than that among men (5.9%; p = 0.012). Through multivariate model analysis, the factors associated with drinking during the pandemic were identified as psychological distress (among men and women) and not attending onsite recovery meetings (among men). Conversely, a longer duration of SHG membership was associated with less drinking during the pandemic for both genders. Conclusion(s): Most SHG members appear to have remained abstinent during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, psychological distress in both genders and the inability to attend recovery meetings among men may have influenced drinking behavior.Copyright © 2023 Research Society on Alcohol.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the behavior and practice of planned and structured physical exercises. This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in physical exercise behavior and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was performed in Brazil and included a total of 595 individuals recruited through social media platforms, personal and professional contacts. Each participant responded to self-completed questionnaire via an online survey between March 29 and May 7, 2020. The characteristics of physical exercise (frequency, intensity, and duration) were collected before and during the pandemic. The subjective state of mood was measured through the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire during the pandemic. A generalized linear model was employed for the analysis. Result(s): Exercising during the pandemic only promoted protective effects on the subjective mood. An exercise frequency of 3-5 days/week was associated with improved vigor and between 6-7 days/week with improved vigor and total mood when compared to not exercising at all (p < .005). A moderate intensity was associated with improved vigor, and a high intensity with improved vigor, total mood, and less fatigue in comparison to low-intensity exercise programs (p < 0.05). Maintaining the same duration of exercise sessions during the pandemic was associated with lower scores of depression/anxiety, fatigue and irritability, and improved vigor and total mood, while performing longer sessions with improved vigor when compared to short exercise sessions (p < .005). Conclusion(s): Regular exercising during the pandemic promotes positive changes in the subjective well-being. Our results reinforce the need for adopting and maintaining a physical exercise routine during the COVID-19 pandemic as a protective effect on mental health.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {Objectives To understand which organisational-structural characteristics of nursing homes - also referred to as long-term care facilities (LTCFs) - and the preventative measures adopted in response to the pandemic are associated with the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. Setting LTCFs in Lazio region in Italy. Design The study adopts a case-control design. Participants We included 141 facilities and 100 provided information for the study. Cases were defined as facilities reporting a COVID-19 outbreak (two or more cases) in March-December 2020; controls were defined as LTCFs reporting one case or zero. The exposures include the structural-organisational characteristics of the LTCFs as reported by the facilities, preventative measures employed and relevant external factors. Results Twenty facilities reported an outbreak of COVID-19. In binary logistic regression models, facilities with more than 15 beds were five times more likely to experience an outbreak than facilities with less than 15 beds OR=5.60 (CI 1.61 to 25.12; p value 0.002); admitting new residents to facilities was associated with a substantially higher risk of an outbreak: 6.46 (CI 1.58 to 27.58, p value 0.004). In a multivariable analysis, facility size was the only variable that was significantly associated with a COVID-19 outbreak OR= 5.37 (CI 1.58 to 22.8; p value 0.012) for larger facilities (>15 beds) versus smaller (<15 beds). Other characteristics and measures were not associated with an outbreak. Conclusion There was evidence of a higher risk of COVID-19 in larger facilities and when new patients were admitted during the pandemic. All other structural-organisational characteristics and preventative measures were not associated with an outbreak. This finding calls into question existing policies, especially where there is a risk of harm to residents. One such example is the restriction of visitor access to facilities, resulting in the social isolation of residents.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate determining factors of happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Large online surveys in Japan before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 25482 individuals who are representatives of the Japanese population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported happiness measured using a 10-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicated higher levels of happiness. We defined participants with >=8 on the scale as having high levels of happiness. RESULT(S): Among the 25482 respondents, the median score of self-reported happiness was 7 (IQR 6-8), with 11418 (45%) reporting high levels of happiness during the pandemic. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that meaning in life, having a spouse, trust in neighbours and female gender were positively associated with happiness (eg, adjusted OR (aOR) for meaning in life 4.17; 95% CI 3.92 to 4.43; p<0.001). Conversely, self-reported poor health, anxiety about future household income, psychiatric diseases except depression and feeling isolated were negatively associated with happiness (eg, aOR for self-reported poor health 0.44; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.48; p<0.001). Using machine-learning methods, we found that meaning in life and social capital (eg, having a spouse and trust in communities) were the strongest positive determinants of happiness, whereas poor health, anxiety about future household income and feeling isolated were important negative determinants of happiness. Among 6965 subjects who responded to questionnaires both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no systemic difference in the patterns as to determinants of declined happiness during the pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Using machine-learning methods on data from large online surveys in Japan, we found that interventions that have a positive impact on social capital as well as successful pandemic control and economic stimuli may effectively improve the population-level psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

   abstract = {Objective To assess the impact of different phase-out measures approved by several European governments. Design This is a longitudinal observational study. Settings European countries, from 20 February 2020 to 11 May 2020. Participants All European countries that implemented at least one phase-out measure dictated by governments, during the follow-up period. Main outcome New COVID-19 cases, analysed as daily rate by countries. Methods We compared the observed versus the predicted rates of new confirmed cases, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and deaths by regions in Spain, to assess the accuracy of the proposed generalised estimating equations and hurdle models. Based on these models, we defined and calculated two indices to quantify the impact of the phase-out measures approved in several European countries. Results After 2-month follow-up, we confirmed the good performance of these models for the prediction of the incidence of new confirmed cases, hospital admission, ICU admission and death in a 7-day window. We found that certain phase-out measures implemented in Italy, Spain and Denmark showed moderate impact in daily new confirmed cases. Due to these different phase-out measures, in Italy, the estimated increment of new confirmed cases per 100 000 inhabitants was 4.61, 95% CI (4.42 to 4.80), in Spain 2.58, 95% CI (2.54 to 2.62) and in Denmark 2.55, 95% CI (2.40 to 2.69). Other significant measures applied in other countries had no impact. Conclusion The two indices proposed can be used to quantify the impact of the phase-out measures and to help other countries to make the best decision. Monitoring these phase-out measures over time can minimise the negative effects on citizens.Copyright ©},

   journal = {Human resources for health},
   volume = {19},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid and effective emergency response to address health security relies on a competent and suitably trained local and international workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied epidemiology workforce. METHOD(S): We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020 through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included demographic details of participants, along with their technical background, level of formal education, topics studied during epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi2) to test the difference between categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to open-ended questions. RESULT(S): In total, 282 people responded to the survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74% (n=210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common. FETP graduates reported higher levels of formal training in all survey topics. CONCLUSION(S): It is critical for the health security workforce to be well-trained and equipped with skills needed to ensure a rapid and effective response to acute public health events. Leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and specialist training in emergency response are lacking in current training models. Our study has demonstrated that applied epidemiology workforce training must evolve to remain relevant to current and future public health challenges.},

   abstract = {Background: Determinants of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death are still unclear for COVID-19. Few studies have adjusted for confounding for different clinical outcomes including all reported cases within a country. Aim(s): We used routine surveillance data from Portugal to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, and to support risk stratification, public health interventions, and planning of healthcare resources. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory- confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported between 1 March and 28 April 2020 through the national epidemiological surveillance system. We calculated absolute risk, relative risk (RR) and adjusted relative risk (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalisation, ICU admission and death using Poisson regressions. Result(s): Increasing age (>= 60 years) was the major determinant for all outcomes. Age >= 90 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR: 6.1), and 70-79 years for ICU (aRR: 10.4). Comorbidities of cardiovascular, immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR: 4.3, 2.8, 2.4, 2.0, respectively) had stronger associations with ICU admission, while for death they were kidney, cardiovascular and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0). Conclusion(s): Older age was the strongest risk factor for all severe outcomes. These findings from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic support risk-stratified public health measures that should prioritise protecting older people. Epidemiological scenarios and clinical guidelines should consider this, even though under-ascertainment should also be considered.Copyright © 2021 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

   abstract = {Background: In Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic new funding models were introduced to support telehealth consultations, resulting in their widescale adoption in palliative care service delivery. Clarity around the clinical circumstances and patient populations that might be most appropriate for telehealth models was required. Aim(s): To evaluate patient and physician satisfaction, acceptability and utility of outpatient palliative care provision through telehealth. Method(s): This is a multi-site prospective, cross-sectional, observational study conducted during a time of significant public health restrictions. A survey was used to collect matched patient- and physician-reported perceptions of palliative care telehealth consultations across three metropolitan hospitals in Victoria, Australia. Result(s): There were 127 matched patient-physician data of telehealth consultations and a further 812 physician-only assessments. Telehealth was generally acceptable and satisfactory, with patients providing greater positive scores than clinicians. Telehealth incorporating both audio and video were more acceptable and satisfactory, particularly with the presence of a carer, and during routine reviews. Physicians were less satisfied using telehealth when there was increasing symptom complexity across all domains (pain, psychological, and other symptoms). Conclusion(s): Telehealth has high utility in palliative care practice. A future hybrid model of care comprising both face-to-face and telehealth consultations seems favoured by patients and physicians but must be accompanied by targeted support for specific patient groups to ensure equitable healthcare access. Further evaluation of telehealth during a time of fewer public health emergency measures and lower community anxiety is required to fully understand its ongoing role.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {Objectives: COVID-19 may spread rapidly in densely populated urban informal settlements. Kenya swiftly implemented mitigation policies; we assess the economic, social and health-related harm disproportionately impacting women. Design(s): A prospective longitudinal cohort study with repeated mobile phone surveys in April, May and June 2020. Participants and setting: 2009 households across five informal settlements in Nairobi, sampled from two previously interviewed cohorts. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Outcomes include food insecurity, risk of household violence and forgoing necessary health services due to the pandemic. Gender-stratified linear probability regression models were constructed to determine the factors associated with these outcomes. Result(s): By May, more women than men reported adverse effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on their lives. Women were 6 percentage points more likely to skip a meal versus men (coefficient: 0.055; 95% CI 0.016 to 0.094), and those who had completely lost their income were 15 percentage points more likely versus those employed (coefficient: 0.154; 95% CI 0.125 to 0.184) to skip a meal. Compared with men, women were 8 percentage points more likely to report increased risk of household violence (coefficient: 0.079; 95% CI 0.028 to 0.130) and 6 percentage points more likely to forgo necessary healthcare (coefficient: 0.056; 95% CI 0.037 to 0.076). Conclusion(s): The pandemic rapidly and disproportionately impacted the lives of women. As Kenya reopens, policymakers must deploy assistance to ensure women in urban informal settlements are able to return to work, and get healthcare and services they need to not lose progress on gender equity made to date.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 guideline modifications on head and neck cancer (HNC) care at two tertiary care centers in Canada. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted. HNC patients seen at two tertiary care centers before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-pandemic: July 1st, 2019, to February 29th, 2020; pandemic: March 1st, 2020, to October 31st, 2020) were included. The pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts were compared according to patient and tumor characteristics, duration of HNC workup, and treatment type and duration. Mean differences in cancer care wait times, including time to diagnosis, tumor board, and treatment as well as total treatment package time and postoperative hospital stay were compared between cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare characteristics and outcomes between cohorts. Result(s): Pre-pandemic (n = 132) and pandemic (n = 133) patients did not differ significantly in sex, age, habits, or tumor characteristics. The percentage of patients who received surgery only, chemo/radiotherapy (CXRT) only, and surgery plus adjuvant CXRT did not differ significantly between cohorts. Pandemic patients experienced a significant time reduction compared to pre-pandemic patients with regards to the date first seen by a HNC service until start of treatment (x = 48.7 and 76.6 days respectively; p =.0001), the date first seen by a HNC service until first presentation at tumor board (x = 25.1 and 38 days respectively; p =.001), mean total package time for patients who received surgery only (x = 3.7 and 9.0 days respectively; p =.017), and mean total package time for patients who received surgery plus adjuvant CXRT (x = 80.2 and 112.7 days respectively; p =.035). Conclusion(s): The time to treatment was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic. This transparent model of patient-centered operative-room prioritization can serve as a model for improving resource allocation and efficiency of HNC care during emergency and non-emergency scenarios.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To test the validity of a COVID-19 public stigma scale and an attributional model of stigma during the early stages of the pandemic. DESIGN: We administered a cross-sectional survey that included scales related to COVID-19 stigma to U.S. adults. SETTING: We used Amazon MTurk online survey panel to recruit participants in June 2020. SUBJECTS: U.S. adults (N = 170) participated in the study. Participants were average age of 37 and majority were men (61.2%) and White (77.6%). MEASURES: The Stigma Towards Disease Scale (SDS) was adapted to measure public stigma directed towards COVID-19 (SDS-C19). Additional stigma-related measures were adapted for this study. ANALYSIS: Factorial structure of SDS-C19 was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Validity of SDS was examined using Pearson correlations with other stigma measures. We evaluated the attributional model of stigma using structural equation modeling. RESULT(S): Internal consistency of SDS-C19 was high and a three-factor model reflecting cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors was supported (chi2 [71, N = 170] =140.954, P = .00, CFI= .946, TLI = .931, RMSEA = .076, SRMR = .087). The SDS-C19 had strong correlations with other stigma-related measures. A blame-mediated attribution model was supported (chi2 [8, N = 170] = 21.793, P = .00, CFI = .976, TLI =.956, RMSEA = .101, SRMR = .058). CONCLUSION(S): The SDS-C19 is a valid tool for assessing COVID-19 stigma. SDS-C19 and the attribution model can guide public health communication.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic various ambulatory health care models (SARS-CoV-2 contact points: Subspecialised Primary Care Practices, Fever Clinics, and Special Places for Corona-Testing) were organised in a short period in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a region in Southern Germany. The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. RESULT(S): One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p<0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p<0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study suggest that the Subspecialised Primary Care Practice that were implemented during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic contributed containment of the pandemic. Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice indicated that physical separation of patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection was easier compared to those who continued working in their own practice. Additionally, leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident in dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been prospectively registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00022224).},

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infection on sepsis 30-day mortality. A retrospective cohort of patients >18years old with sepsis and organ dysfunction or septic shock was conducted. Univariate analysis was done for variables potentially related to 30-day mortality, and the ones with P values of <0.05 were included in a backward stepwise hierarchic Cox regression model. Variables that remained with P values of <0.05 were retained in the model. A total of 1,190 sepsis episodes were analyzed. Gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in 391 (68.5%) of 571 patients with positive cultures, of which 69 (17.7%) were caused by a CRE organism. Patients with CRE infections had significantly higher 30-day mortality: 63.8% versus 33.4% (P<0.01). CRE infection was also associated with a lower rate of appropriate empirical therapy (P<0.01) and with the presence of septic shock (P<0.01). In the hierarchic multivariate model, CRE remained significant when controlling for demographic variables, comorbidities, and infection site but lost significance when controlling for septic shock and appropriate empirical therapy. Older age (P<0.01), HIV-positive status (P<0.01), cirrhosis (P<0.01), septic shock (P<0.01), higher quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (quick-SOFA) (P<0.01), and appropriate empirical therapy (P=0.01) remained in the final model. CRE infections were associated with higher crude mortality rates. A lower rate of appropriate empirical therapy and late diagnosis were more frequent in this group, and improvement of stewardship programs is needed.IMPORTANCE The importance of this work relies on exploring the impact of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections such as those with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) on sepsis mortality. These infections are growing at alarming rates worldwide and are now among the most frequent and difficult-to-treat bacteria due to the very few options for susceptible antimicrobials available. This study examined 1,190 sepsis episodes, and the main findings were as follows: (i) the prevalence of CRE infections significantly increased over time, (ii) CRE infection was associated with higher 30-day mortality than that of patients with other infections (63.8% versus 33.4%), and (iii) the effect of CRE on mortality was probably influenced by the fact that those patients received lower rates of empirical therapy with active antibiotics and were also diagnosed in more advanced stages of sepsis (septic shock). Those findings point to the need for rapid diagnostic methods to identify these bacteria and the need to adjust therapeutic guidelines to this worrisome epidemiological scenario.Copyright © 2019 Sabino et al.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although dynamic models are increasingly used by decision makers as a source of insight to guide interventions in order to control communicable disease outbreaks, such models have long suffered from a risk of rapid obsolescence due to failure to keep updated with emerging epidemiological evidence. The application of statistical filtering algorithms to high-velocity data streams has recently demonstrated effectiveness in allowing such models to be automatically regrounded by each new set of incoming observations. The attractiveness of such techniques has been enhanced by the emergence of a new generation of geospatially specific, high-velocity data sources, including daily counts of relevant searches and social media posts. The information available in such electronic data sources complements that of traditional epidemiological data sources., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the degree to which the predictive accuracy of pandemic projection models regrounded via machine learning in daily clinical data can be enhanced by extending such methods to leverage daily search counts., METHODS: We combined a previously published influenza A (H1N1) pandemic projection model with the sequential Monte Carlo technique of particle filtering, to reground the model bu using confirmed incident case counts and search volumes. The effectiveness of particle filtering was evaluated using a norm discrepancy metric via predictive and dataset-specific cross-validation., RESULTS: Our results suggested that despite the data quality limitations of daily search volume data, the predictive accuracy of dynamic models can be strongly elevated by inclusion of such data in filtering methods., CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of dynamic models can be notably enhanced by tapping a readily accessible, publicly available, high-velocity data source. This work highlights a low-cost, low-burden avenue for strengthening model-based outbreak intervention response planning using low-cost public electronic datasets.

   pages = {e241-e249},
   abstract = {Background: Despite wide use of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination and benchmarking in the intensive care unit (ICU), the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities has not been examined. Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. Method(s): Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014-15 and 2001-12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. Finding(s): We analysed 166 751 participants (122 919 eICU-CRD and 43 832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 [p=0.016] with APACHE IVa and from 0.75 to 0.77 [p=0.85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0.73 with APACHE IVa and 0.64 with OASIS) and Black people (0.67 and 0.68) versus Asian people (0.77 and 0.95) and White people (0.76 and 0.81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. Interpretation(s): The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: On March 9, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in the northwestern part of India. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a local level is becoming increasingly important to guide measures to control the pandemic., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number (R0) to understand the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at a district level. We used standard mathematical modeling approaches to assess the utility of these factors in determining the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses and projecting the size of the epidemic., METHODS: Contact tracing of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 was performed to obtain the serial intervals. The median and 95th percentile values of the SARS-CoV-2 serial interval were obtained from the best fits with the weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, gamma, and generalized gamma distributions. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived with different methods using the EarlyR and EpiEstim packages in R software., RESULTS: The median and 95th percentile values of the serial interval were 5.23 days (95% CI 4.72-5.79) and 13.20 days (95% CI 10.90-18.18), respectively. R0 during the first 30 days of the outbreak was 1.62 (95% CI 1.07-2.17), which subsequently decreased to 1.15 (95% CI 1.09-1.21). The peak instantaneous R0 values obtained using a Poisson process developed by Jombert et al were 6.53 (95% CI 2.12-13.38) and 3.43 (95% CI 1.71-5.74) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. The peak R0 values obtained using the method by Wallinga and Teunis were 2.96 (95% CI 2.52-3.36) and 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. R0 values of 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.34) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21) for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively, were obtained on July 6, 2020, using method by Jombert et al. Using the method by Wallinga and Teunis, values of 0.32 (95% CI 0.27-0.36) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.58-0.63) were obtained for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively. The projection of cases over the next month was 2131 (95% CI 1799-2462). Reductions of transmission by 25% and 50% corresponding to reasonable and aggressive control measures could lead to 58.7% and 84.0% reductions in epidemic size, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The projected transmission reductions indicate that strengthening control measures could lead to proportionate reductions of the size of the COVID-19 epidemic. Time-dependent instantaneous R0 estimation based on the process by Jombart et al was found to be better suited for guiding COVID-19 response at the district level than overall R0 or instantaneous R0 estimation by the Wallinga and Teunis method. A data-driven approach at the local level is proposed to be useful in guiding public health strategy and surge capacity planning.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and countries' response measures have had a globally significant mental health impact. This mental health burden has also been fueled by an infodemic: an information overload that includes misinformation and disinformation. Suicide, the worst mental health outcome, is a serious public health problem that can be prevented with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Suicide ideation, one important risk factor for suicide, is thus important to measure and monitor, as are the factors that may impact on it. OBJECTIVE(S): This investigation had 2 primary aims: (1) to estimate and compare country-specific prevalence of suicide ideation at 2 different time points, overall and by gender and age groups, and (2) to investigate the influence of sociodemographic and infodemic variables on suicide ideation. METHOD(S): A repeated, online, 8-country (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, and New Zealand), cross-sectional study was undertaken with adults aged >=18 years, with measurement wave 1 conducted from May 29, 2020 to June 12, 2020 and measurement wave 2 conducted November 6-18, 2021. Self-reported suicide ideation was derived from item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Age-standardized suicide ideation rates were reported, a binomial regression model was used to estimate suicide ideation indication rates for each country and measurement wave, and logistic regression models were then employed to relate sociodemographic, pandemic, and infodemic variables to suicide ideation. RESULT(S): The final sample totaled 17,833 adults: 8806 (49.4%) from measurement wave 1 and 9027 (50.6%) from wave 2. Overall, 24.2% (2131/8806) and 27.5% (2486/9027) of participants reported suicide ideation at measurement waves 1 and 2, respectively, a difference that was significant (P<.001). Considerable variability was observed in suicide ideation age-standardized rates between countries, ranging from 15.6% in Belgium (wave 1) to 42.9% in Hong Kong (wave 2). Frequent social media usage was associated with increased suicide ideation at wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.25-1.72; P<.001) but not wave 1 (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96-1.23; P=.16). However, having a weaker sense of coherence (SOC; AOR 3.80, 95% CI 3.18-4.55 at wave 1 and AOR 4.39, 95% CI 3.66-5.27 at wave 2; both P<.001) had the largest overall effect size. CONCLUSION(S): Suicide ideation is prevalent and significantly increasing over time in this COVID-19 pandemic era, with considerable variability between countries. Younger adults and those residing in Hong Kong carried disproportionately higher rates. Social media appears to have an increasingly detrimental association with suicide ideation, although having a stronger SOC had a larger protective effect. Policies and promotion of SOC, together with disseminating health information that explicitly tackles the infodemic's misinformation and disinformation, may importantly reduce the rising mental health morbidity and mortality triggered by this pandemic.Copyright ©Philip J Schluter, Melissa Genereux, Kevin KC Hung, Elsa Landaverde, Ronald P Law, Catherine Pui Yin Mok, Virginia Murray, Tracey O'Sullivan, Zeeshan Qadar, Mathieu Roy.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted maternity care provision worldwide. Studies based on modelling estimated large indirect effects of the pandemic on services and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to prospectively document experiences of frontline maternal and newborn healthcare providers., METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional study of maternal and newborn health professionals via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. Information was collected between 24 March and 10 April 2020 on respondents' background, preparedness for and response to COVID-19 and their experience during the pandemic. An optional module sought information on adaptations to 17 care processes. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregating by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs)., RESULTS: We analysed responses from 714 maternal and newborn health professionals. Only one-third received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, 47% of participants in LMICs and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based practices., CONCLUSIONS: Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information-sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations and support rapid development of effective responses. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

   abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing data has been widely used for COVID-19 surveillance. Existing COVID-19 forecasting models mainly rely on case counts obtained from qPCR results, even though the binary PCR results provide a limited picture of the pandemic trajectory. Most forecasting models have failed to accurately predict the COVID-19 waves before they occur. Recently a model utilizing cross-sectional population cycle threshold (Ct-the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the background threshold) values obtained from PCR tests (Ct-based model) was developed to overcome the limitations of using only binary PCR results. In this study, we aimed to improve on COVID-19 forecasting models using features derived from the Ct-based model, to detect epidemic waves earlier than case-based trajectories. Method(s): PCR data was collected weekly at Northeastern University (NU) between August 2020 and January 2022. Campus and county epidemic trajectories were generated from case counts. A novel forecasting approach was developed by enhancing a recent deep learning model with Ct-based features and applied in Suffolk County and NU campus. For this, cross-sectional Ct values from PCR data were used to generate Ct-based epidemic trajectories, including effective reproductive rate (Rt) and incidence. The improvement in forecasting performance was compared using absolute errors and residual squared errors with respect to actual observed cases at the 7-day and 14-day forecasting horizons. The model was also tested prospectively over the period January 2022 to April 2022. Result(s): Rt curves estimated from the Ct-based model indicated epidemic waves 12 to 14 days earlier than Rt curves from NU campus and Suffolk County cases, with a correlation of 0.57. Enhancing the forecasting models with Ct-based information significantly decreased absolute error (decrease of 49.4 and 221.5 for the 7 and 14-day forecasting horizons) and residual squared error (40.6 and 217.1 for the 7 and 14-day forecasting horizons) compared to the original model without Ct features. Conclusion(s): Ct-based epidemic trajectories can herald an earlier signal for impending epidemic waves in the community and forecast transmission peaks. Moreover, COVID-19 forecasting models can be enhanced using these Ct features to improve their forecasting accuracy. In this study, we make the case that public health agencies should publish Ct values along with the binary positive/negative PCR results. Early and accurate forecasting of epidemic waves can inform public health policies and countermeasures which can mitigate spread.Copyright © 2023 Sharmin, Manivannan, Woo, Sorel, Auclair, Gandhi and Mujawar.},

   journal = {Journal of Medical Internet Research},
   volume = {22},
   number = {5},
   pages = {19421},
   abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. Method(s): We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify "sick posts," in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. Result(s): We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. Conclusion(s): Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.Copyright © Cuihua Shen, Anfan Chen, Chen Luo, Jingwen Zhang, Bo Feng, Wang Liao.

   journal = {Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine},
   volume = {26},
   number = {1},
   pages = {95},
   abstract = {Background: The study aimed to explore the factors influencing protective behavior and its association with factors during the post-COVID-19 period in China based on the risk perception emotion model and the protective action decision model (PADM). Method(s): A total of 2830 valid questionnaires were collected as data for empirical analysis via network sampling in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to explore the relationships between the latent variables. Result(s): SEM indicated that social emotion significantly positively affected protective behavior and intention. Protective behavioral intention had significant direct effects on protective behavior, and the direct effects were also the largest. Government trust did not have a significant effect on protective behavior but did have a significant indirect effect. Moreover, it was found that government trust had the greatest direct effect on social emotion. In addition, we found that excessive risk perception level may directly reduce people's intention and frequency of engaging in protective behavior, which was not conducive to positive, protective behavior. Conclusion(s): In the post-COVID-19 period, theoretical framework constructed in this study can be used to evaluate people's protective behavior. The government should strengthen its information-sharing and interaction with the public, enhance people's trust in the government, create a positive social mood, appropriately regulate people's risk perception, and, finally, maintain a positive attitude and intent of protection.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   title = {The Nurse-Physician Relationship During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Shanghai, China: Cross-sectional Study},
   journal = {JMIR formative research},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {e41729},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nurse-physician relationship is important for the stability of collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the health care system and has placed greater demands on nurse-physician collaboration. Nurses and physicians often struggle to share mutual responsibility and communicate effectively., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between nurses and physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and construct a new model combining the attitude and behaviors of the 2 groups to assess various factors' impacts on job satisfaction and confrontational behavior., METHODS: We conducted this quantitative cross-sectional study to assess the relationship between nurses and physicians based on the attitudes and behaviors toward nurse-physician collaboration. We first investigated the satisfaction of nurses and physicians with their relationship and how they thought the COVID-19 pandemic had affected that relationship. We used an adapted and modified Jefferson Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Nurse Collaboration questionnaire that consisted of 17 items under 5 dimensions. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relationships between domains. Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between different domains of the questionnaire and the satisfaction of the current nurse-physician relationship., RESULTS: We included a total of 176 nurses and 124 physicians in this study. Compared to 7.2% (9/124) of physicians, 22.7% (40/176) of nurses were dissatisfied with the current nurse-physician relationship. Most physicians (101/124, 81.5%) and nurses (131/176, 74.5%) agreed that the nurse-physician relationship had become better because of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the public had greater respect for them. However, significantly fewer nurses (59/176, 33.5% vs 79/124, 63.7%; P<.001) thought that physicians and nurses were treated with the same respect. Nurses scored significantly higher scores in caring versus curing (mean 16.27, SD 2.88 vs mean 17.43, SD 2.50; P<.001) and physician's authority (mean 8.72, SD 3.21 vs mean 7.24, SD 3.32; P<.001) subscales compared with physicians. The shared education and collaboration subscale had a significantly positive relationship with the nurse's autonomy subscale (standardized coefficient=0.98; P<.001). Logistic regression showed that 4 subscales (shared education and collaboration: P<.001; caring versus curing: P<.001; nurse's autonomy: P<.001; and confrontation: P=.01) were significantly associated with the level of satisfaction of the current nurse-physician relationship., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that nurses were more dissatisfied with the current nurse-physician relationship than physicians in Shanghai. Policy makers and managers in the medical and educational system should emphasize an interprofessional collaboration between nurses and physicians. Positive attitudes toward shared collaboration and responsibility may help to improve the relationship between the 2 parties. Copyright ©Yueping Shi, Pinhua Gu, Qiufeng Wang, Xuelian Zhang.

   abstract = {Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately strained households experiencing poverty, particularly Black and Latino households. Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. Method(s): Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged >=18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. Result(s): Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P <.001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018). Conclusion(s): Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic increased among low-income Black households enrolled in SNAP and residing in a food desert. Public health recovery efforts might focus on modifying SNAP to improve the food security of people experiencing poverty.Copyright © 2021, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.},

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {894128},
   abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protective measures have been prescribed to prevent or slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and protect the population. Individuals follow these measures to varying degrees. We aimed to identify factors influencing the extent to which protective measures are adhered to. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey (telephone interviews) was undertaken between April and June 2021 to identify factors influencing the degree to which individuals adhere to protective measures. A representative sample of 1,003 people (age >16 years) in two Austrian states (Carinthia, Vorarlberg) was interviewed. The questionnaire was based on the Health Belief Model, but also included potential response-modifying factors. Predictors for adherent behavior were identified using multiple regression analysis. All predictors were standardized so that regression coefficients (beta) could be compared. Result(s): Overall median adherence was 0.75 (IQR: 0.5-1.0). Based on a regression model, the following variables were identified as significant in raising adherence: higher age (beta = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.33-0.54), social standards of acceptable behavior (beta = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.27-0.40), subjective/individual assessment of an increased personal health risk (beta = 0.12, 95%CI: 0.05-0.18), self-efficacy (beta = 0.06, 95%CI: 0.02-0.10), female gender (beta = 0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.08), and low corona fatigue (behavioral fatigue: beta = -0.11, 95%CI: -0.18 to -0.03). The model showed that such aspects as personal trust in institutions, perceived difficulties in adopting health-promoting measures, and individual assessments of the risk of infection, had no significant influence. Conclusion(s): This study reveals that several factors significantly influence adherence to measures aimed at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To enhance adherence, the government, media, and other relevant stakeholders should take the findings into consideration when formulating policy. By developing social standards and promoting self-efficacy, individuals can influence the behavior of others and contribute toward coping with the pandemic.Copyright © 2022 Siebenhofer, Konczol, Jeitler, Schmid, Elliott and Avian.},

   pages = {e7090},
   abstract = {Background: Breast cancer patients experienced heightened anxiety during the pandemic. Also, modifications to clinical trial activities allowing for virtual platforms, local assessments, and greater flexibility were introduced to facilitate participation. We sought to evaluate the association between pandemic-related anxiety and willingness to participate in trials and how pandemic-era modifications to trial activities affect the decision to participate. Method(s): We conducted an online survey from August to September, 2021 of patients with breast cancer assessing pandemic-related anxiety; clinical trials knowledge and attitudes; willingness to participate during and before the pandemic; and how each modification affects the decision to participate. Fisher's exact tests evaluated differences in proportions and two-sample t-tests evaluated differences in means. The association of pandemic-related anxiety with a decline in willingness to participate during compared to prior to the pandemic was modeled using logistic regression. Result(s): Among 385 respondents who completed the survey, 81% reported moderate-severe pandemic-related anxiety. Mean willingness to participate in a trial was lower during the pandemic than prior [2.97 (SD 1.17) vs. 3.10 (SD 1.09), (p < 0.001)]. Severe anxiety was associated with higher odds of diminished willingness to participate during the pandemic compared to prior (OR 5.07). Each of the modifications, with the exception of opting out of research-only blood tests, were endorsed by >50% of respondents as strategies that would increase their likelihood of deciding to participate. Conclusion(s): While pandemic-related anxiety was associated with diminished willingness to participate in trials, the leading reasons for reluctance to consider trial participation were unrelated to the pandemic but included worries about not getting the best treatment, side effects, and delaying care. Patients view trial modifications favorably, supporting continuation of these modifications, as endorsed by the National Cancer Institute and others.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require accessible, timely, and noninvasive strategies to monitor disease. The aim was to assess the integration of intestinal ultrasound (IUS) on decision-making and endoscopy utilization in a standardized care pathway. Method(s): This prospective, multicenter, international, observational cohort study included patients seen within a centralized model for IBD care was conducted during the COVID pandemic. Patients were evaluated with IUS alone or in combination with an in-clinic, unsedated sigmoidoscopy. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, clinical decisions, and need for urgent endoscopy, hospitalization, and surgeries were recorded. Result(s): Of the 158 patients included, the majority had an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease (n=123, 78%), and 47% (n=75) of patients were on biologic therapy. IUS identified active inflammation in 65% (n=102) of patients, and strictures in 14% (n=22). Fecal calprotectin levels correlated with inflammation detected on IUS (median of 50 mug/g [Q1-Q3: 26-107 mug/g] without inflammation and 270 mug/g [Q1-Q3: 61-556 mug/g] with inflammation; p=0.0271). In the majority of patients, clinical assessment with IUS led to an acute change in IBD-specific medications (57%, n=90) and avoided or delayed the need for urgent endoscopy (85%, n=134). Four patients were referred for urgent surgical consultation. Conclusion(s): Point-of-care IUS used in a flare clinic pathway is a useful strategy to improve effective IBD care delivery and to assist in therapeutic management decisions, in many cases avoiding the acute need for endoscopy.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Importance: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility rates has been suggested in the lay press and anticipated based on documented decreases in fertility and pregnancy rates during previous major societal and economic shifts. Anticipatory planning for birth rates is important for health care systems and government agencies to accurately estimate size of economy and model working and/or aging populations. Objective(s): To use projection modeling based on electronic health care records in a large US university medical center to estimate changes in pregnancy and birth rates prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic societal lockdowns. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included all pregnancy episodes within a single US academic health care system retrospectively from 2017 and modeled prospectively to 2021. Data were analyzed September 2021. Exposures: Pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was number of new pregnancy episodes initiated within the health care system and use of those episodes to project birth volumes. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the degree to which COVID-19 societal changes may have factored into pregnancy episode volume. Potential reasons for the changes in volumes were compared with historical pregnancy volumes, including delays in starting prenatal care, interruptions in reproductive endocrinology and infertility services, and preterm birth rates. Result(s): This cohort study documented a steadily increasing number of pregnancy episodes over the study period, from 4100 pregnancies in 2017 to 4620 in 2020 (28284 total pregnancies; median maternal [interquartile range] age, 30 [27-34] years; 18728 [66.2%] White women, 3794 [13.4%] Black women; 2177 [7.7%] Asian women). A 14% reduction in pregnancy episode initiation was observed after the societal shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P <.001). This decrease appeared to be due to a decrease in conceptions that followed the March 15 mandated COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown. Prospective modeling of pregnancies currently suggests that a birth volume surge can be anticipated in summer 2021. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study using electronic medical record surveillance found an initial decline in births associated with the COVID-19 pandemic societal changes and an anticipated increase in birth volume. Future studies can further explore how pregnancy episode volume changes can be monitored and birth rates projected in real-time during major societal events..Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns have impacted lifestyle behaviors, including eating habits and physical activity; yet, few studies have identified the emerging patterns of such changes and associated risk factors. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to identify the patterns of weight and lifestyle behavior changes, and the potential risk factors, resulting from the pandemic in Canadian adults. METHOD(S): Analyses were conducted on 1609 adults (18-89 years old; n=1450, 90.1%, women; n=1316, 81.8%, White) of the Canadian COVIDiet study baseline data (May-December 2020). Self-reported current and prepandemic weight, physical activity, smoking status, perceived eating habits, alcohol intake, and sleep quality were collected through online questionnaires. Based on these 6 indicator variables, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify lifestyle behavior change patterns. Associations with potential risk factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, chronic diseases, body image perception, and changes in the stress level, living situation, and work arrangement, were examined with logistic regressions. RESULT(S): Participants' mean BMI was 26.1 (SD 6.3) kg/m2. Of the 1609 participants, 980 (60.9%) had a bachelor's degree or above. Since the pandemic, 563 (35%) had decreased income and 788 (49%) changed their work arrangement. Most participants reported unchanged weight, sleep quality, physical activity level, and smoking and alcohol consumption, yet 708 (44%) reported a perceived decrease in eating habit quality. From LCA, 2 classes of lifestyle behavior change emerged: healthy and less healthy (probability: 0.605 and 0.395, respectively; Bayesian information criterion [BIC]=15574, entropy=4.8). The healthy lifestyle behavior change group more frequently reported unchanged weight, sleep quality, smoking and alcohol intake, unchanged/improved eating habits, and increased physical activity. The less healthy lifestyle behavior change group reported significant weight gain, deteriorated eating habits and sleep quality, unchanged/increased alcohol intake and smoking, and decreased physical activity. Among risk factors, body image dissatisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 8.8, 95% CI 5.3-14.7), depression (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5), increased stress level (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.8), and gender minority identity (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.3-22.3) were associated with adopting less healthy behaviors in adjusted models. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared to have influenced lifestyle behaviors unfavorably in some but favorably in others. Body image perception, change in stress level, and gender identity are factors associated with behavior change patterns; whether these will sustain over time remains to be studied. Findings provide insights into developing strategies for supporting adults with poorer mental well-being in the postpandemic context and promoting healthful behaviors during future disease outbreaks.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the training and readiness levels of Collegiate Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers to respond to mass casualty incidents (MCIs). METHOD(S): An anonymous cross-sectional survey of Collegiate EMS providers was performed. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were US-based EMS providers affiliated with the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were levels of EMS experience and MCI training, subjective readiness levels for responding to various MCI scenarios, and analyzing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MCI response capabilities. RESULT(S): Respondents had a median age of 21 years (interquartile range IQR 20, 22), with 86 percent (n = 96/112) being trained to the Emergency Medical Technician-Basic level. Providers reported participating in an average of 1.6 MCI trainings over the last four years (IQR, 1.0, 2.2). Subjective MCI response readiness levels were highest with active assailant attacks followed by large event evacuations, natural disasters, hazardous material (HAZMAT) incidents, targeted automobile ramming attacks, explosions, and finally bioweapons release. Disparate to this, only 18 percent of participants reported training in the fundamentals of tactical and disaster medicine. With respect to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MCI readiness, 27 percent of respondents reported being less prepared, and there was a statistically significant decrease in subjective readiness to respond to HAZMAT incidents. CONCLUSION(S): Given low rates of MCI training but high rates of self-assessed MCI preparedness, respondents may overestimate their readiness to adequately respond to the complexity of a real-world MCI. More objective assessment measures are needed to evaluate provider preparedness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This is the first study on prognostication in an entire cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the city of Hong Kong. Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. METHOD(S): We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. RESULT(S): The 1037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD+/-17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro-/micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%/91.3% and 96.0%/95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%/94.2% and 97.8%/97.1% under Day-5 model. CONCLUSION(S): Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome. The model is transformed into a simple online calculator to provide convenient clinical reference tools at the point of care, with an aim to inform clinical decision on triage and step-down care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caught the world off guard and unprepared, initiating a global pandemic. In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their health care systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policy makers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection., METHODS: Three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from North Carolina and the greater Charlotte Region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics such as the basic reproduction number., RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte Region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI 2.11-3.25) and in North Carolina 2.94 days (95% CI 2.33-4.00). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte Region to 4.70 days (95% CI 3.77-6.22) and in North Carolina to 4.01 days (95% CI 3.43-4.83). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte Region compared to North Carolina as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for North Carolina and 0.43 for the Charlotte Region. In addition, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-int model emerged as the model with better fit., CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policy makers, public health officials, and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.

   abstract = {Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has been painful and no single model for such a purpose is perfect. However, sharing experiences is the best way for countries to learn real-time lessons and adapt to this rapidly changing pandemic. This commentary shares with the international community how an adaptive model of health system organization and responses helped Vietnam to break transmission of coronavirus. We find that an effective model is adaptive to time and context, and mobilizes and engages the wider society. We identify merging of different health system units into Center for Diseases Controls as a health system organization that saved massive resources. The early establishment of a formal committee responding to the pandemic helped unify every public health strategy. The mobilization of different stakeholders and communities added resources and facilitated a synchronous implementation of response strategies, even where those strategies involved significant personal or financial sacrifice. National training on Covid-19 treatment for healthcare professionals across the entire hospital system was useful to expand the health service availability. Quickly published response guidelines helped to activate every level of the health system and involve every sector of society. A strategy of keeping high alert and preemptive action is also essential for coping with the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Despite these advances, most NTD programs have recently experienced important setbacks; for example, NTD interventions were some of the most frequently and severely impacted by service disruptions due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Mathematical modeling can help inform selection of interventions to meet the targets set out in the NTD road map 2021-2030, and such studies should prioritize questions that are relevant for decision-makers, especially those designing, implementing, and evaluating national and subnational programs. In September 2022, the World Health Organization hosted a stakeholder meeting to identify such priority modeling questions across a range of NTDs and to consider how modeling could inform local decision making. Here, we summarize the outputs of the meeting, highlight common themes in the questions being asked, and discuss how quantitative modeling can support programmatic decisions that may accelerate progress towards the 2030 targets.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

   journal = {Public Health Nursing},
   volume = {40},
   number = {1},
   pages = {208-217},
   abstract = {Background: Social distance practices are crucial for outpatient clinics during disease outbreaks and are an effective preventive measure for reducing influenza transmission during such pandemics in people with poor health. Method(s): This study applies an evidence-based practice (EBP) approach to confirm the effectiveness of social distancing in healthy individuals during an influenza pandemic and employs the induced ordered weighted averaging model to confirm the effectiveness of EBP. The study design, validity, reliability, results, and generalizability focused on discussing three systematic reviews and two cohort studies via the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). First, by introducing the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) question; second, by establishing the five steps of EBP; third, by utilizing the CASP checklist for the appraisal; and finally, by presenting a conclusion. Result(s): According to the hierarchy of evidence, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses retrieved five articles for addressing the PICO question. All the evidence demonstrates that social distancing is valuable during influenza pandemics among non-infected individuals. Precise, timely, and robust social distancing implementation can reduce the spread of infection, delay the epidemic peak, and ease the pressure on healthcare resources. Gatekeepers are responsible for guiding individuals through the implementation process for reducing influenza transmission, particularly in densely populated areas. Conclusion(s): Social distance is crucial for outpatient clinics during an epidemic and effectively reduces the spread of infection, delay epidemic peaks, and eases pressure on healthcare resources.Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

   journal = {Public Health},
   volume = {217},
   pages = {7-14},
   abstract = {Objectives: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the full reopening of the economy typically accelerated viral transmission. This study aims to determine whether policy response could contribute to the dual objective of both reducing the spread of the epidemic and revitalising economic activities. Study design: This is a longitudinal study of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa (BRIICS) from the first quarter (Q1) of 2020 to the same period of 2021. Method(s): From a health-economic perspective, this study established a framework to illustrate the following outcomes: suppression-prosperity, outbreak-stagnancy, outbreak-prosperity and suppression-stagnancy scenarios. Multinomial logistic models were used to analyse the associations between policy response with both the pandemic and the economy. The study further examined two subtypes of policy response, stringency/health measures and economic support measures, separately. The probabilities of the different scenarios were estimated. Result(s): Economic prosperity and epidemic suppression were significantly associated with policy response. The effects of policy response on health-economic scenarios took the form of inverse U-shapes with the increase in intensity. 'Leptokurtic', 'bimodal' and 'long-tailed' curves demonstrated the estimated possibilities of suppression-prosperity, outbreak-prosperity and suppression-stagnancy scenarios, respectively. In addition, stringency/health policies followed the inverted U-shaped pattern, whereas economic support policies showed a linear pattern. Conclusion(s): It was possible to achieve the dual objective of economic growth and epidemic control simultaneously, and the effects of policy response were shaped like an inverse U. These findings provide a new perspective for balancing the economy with public health during the early stages of the pandemic.Copyright © 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health},

   journal = {Chiropractic and Manual Therapies},
   volume = {31},
   number = {1},
   pages = {34},
   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on healthcare, and the health of healthcare workers has been subject of much research. However, studies of health-related factors in manual therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic are scarce. Research in this field can provide valuable insights for future crises policy and guidelines, including in regions where the public health response to COVID-19 contrasts with that of most other international jurisdictions. The aim was to describe the prevalence of psychological distress and musculoskeletal pain, and to investigate factors potentially associated with high psychological distress and activity-limiting musculoskeletal pain in clinically active chiropractors and naprapaths during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a representative sample of Swedish manual therapists, between November 2020 and January 2021. High psychological distress and activity-limiting musculoskeletal pain were investigated regarding associations with residing in a municipality with a high spread of infection, a previous/ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical interferences and economic consequences associated with the pandemic. Generalized Linear Models with log link and binomial distribution were used, computing prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Result(s): A total of 762 participants were included, representing 46% of the source population. The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was 17%, 7%, and 12%, respectively. Neck (50%), low back (46%), upper back (40%), and shoulders (39%) were the most prevalent musculoskeletal pain areas. Economic consequences due to the pandemic were associated with high psychological distress (PR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.48-3.53). Conclusion(s): During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, manual therapists primarily suffered from musculoskeletal pain related to the back and shoulders, while depressive symptoms were the most common symptom of psychological distress. Owners of businesses that suffered economic consequences had a higher prevalence of high psychological distress, which may call for targeted support of this group in future similar contexts. Future longitudinal studies during the pandemic are warranted to assess these associations further.Copyright © 2023, Chiropractic and Osteopathic College of Australasia, European Academy of Chiropractic, The Royal College of Chiropractors, Nordic Institute of Chiropractic and Clinical Biomechanics and BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: On the 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Multiple new guidelines were proposed and existing models of social, domestic and hospital care altered. Most healthcare systems were largely unprepared for this, and the pandemic has tested their adaptability. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the demographics, presentation, clinical management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral (hip) fractures comparing them to a similar cohort of patients admitted a year earlier. METHOD(S): This retrospective multi-centre cohort study compared all patients admitted with hip fractures between 1st March and 30th May 2019 (group PC: pre-COVID-19) with hip fracture patients admitted over the same time period during the pandemic in 2020 (group C: COVID-19). The data was obtained from the hospitals' local and National Hip Fracture Databases. Mortality data was checked with the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Primary outcomes were time to theatre, in-patient length of stay and 30-day mortality. RESULT(S): A total of 580 patients were included (304 group PC, 276 group C). Patient demographics including Charlson Comorbidity Index and Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores were broadly similar across the two cohorts. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of total hip replacements (11 to 5%, p = 0.006) in group C. There was an increase in conservative management (1 to 5%, p = 0.002) in group C. Time to theatre was significantly delayed in group C (43.7h) vs group PC (34.6h) (p <= 0.001). The overall length of hospital stay was significantly longer in group PC (16.6days) vs group C (15days) (p = 0.025). The 30-day mortality rate in group C was 9.8% compared to 8.2% in group PC (p = 0.746), but for COVID-19 (+) patients, it was significantly higher at 38.2% vs 5.8% in COVID-19 (-) patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): This is one of the largest multi-centre comparative cohort study in the literature to date examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of hip fracture patients. Whilst mortality rates were similar in both groups, COVID-19-positive patients were almost seven times more likely to die, reflecting the seriousness of the COVID-19 infection and its sequelae in such elderly, vulnerable patients.},

   journal = {The Lancet Infectious Diseases},
   volume = {20},
   number = {12},
   pages = {1437-1445},
   abstract = {Background: Puerto Rico began screening blood donations for Zika virus RNA with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) on April 3, 2016, because of an emerging Zika virus outbreak. We followed up positive donors to assess the dynamics of viral and serological markers during the early stages of Zika virus infection and update the estimate of infection incidence in the Puerto Rican population during the outbreak. Method(s): Blood donations from volunteer donors in Puerto Rico were screened for the presence of Zika virus RNA using the cobas Zika NAAT. Positive donations were further tested to confirm infection, estimate viral load, and identify Zika virus-specific IgM antibodies. Individuals with positive blood donations were invited to attend follow-up visits. Donations with confirmed infection (defined as detection of Zika virus RNA or IgM on additional testing of index or follow-up samples) were assessed for stage of infection according to Zika virus RNA detectability in simulated minipools, viral load, and Zika virus IgM status. A three-step process was used to estimate the mean duration of NAAT reactivity of Zika virus in human plasma from individuals identified pre-seroconversion with at least one follow up visit and to update the 2016 incidence estimate of Zika virus infection. Finding(s): Between April 3 and Dec 31, 2016, 53 112 blood donations were screened for Zika virus, of which 351 tested positive, 339 had confirmed infections, and 319 could be staged. Compared with IgM-positive index donations (n=110), IgM-negative index donations (n=209) had higher mean viral loads (1.1 x 106 vs 8.3 x 104 international units per mL) and were more likely to be detected in simulated minipools (93% [n=194] vs 26% [n=29]). The proportions of donations with confirmed infections that had viral RNA detected only in individual-donation NAATs (ie, not in simulated minipools) and were IgM positive increased as the epidemic evolved. The estimated mean duration of NAAT detectability in the 140 donors included in the follow-up study was 11.70 days (95% CI 10.06-14.36). Applying this detection period to the observed proportion of donations that were confirmed NAAT positive yielded a Zika virus seasonal incidence estimate of 21.1% (95% CI 18.1-24.1); 768 101 infections in a population of 3 638 773 in 2016. Interpretation(s): Characterisation of early Zika virus infection has implications for blood safety because infectivity of blood donations and utility of screening methods likely correlate with viral load and serological stage of infection. Our findings also have implications for diagnostic testing, public health surveillance, and epidemiology, and we estimate that around 21% of the Puerto Rican population was infected during the 2016 outbreak.

   abstract = {The HIV epidemic in Thailand in the 1980's compromised the country's socio-economic development. The epidemic first became evident in the community of men with male sexual partners (MSM), and subsequently spread to intravenous drug users (IVDU), female commercial sex workers (CSW) and their male clients, and, ultimately, to their partners and children. The HIV epidemic has devastated the country's working-age population. The extensive negative impact and social stigma associated with the disease do not only have an impact on the victims of HIV but also on their descendants and relatives. An epicenter of the HIV epidemic has been in the northern provinces of Thailand. An HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE, a complex chimeric virus composed of both A and E subtypes, is prevalent in Northern Thailand. The virus has quickly become a predominant viral strain circulating in Thailand, other neighboring Southeast Asian countries, and China as well as some other countries throughout the world. The epidemiology, evolution, and biology of CRF01_AE offer a unique model for further scientific investigations which would advance the knowledge of and curative strategies against HIV. In addition, Thailand has developed suitable national guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention in order to control the epidemic. Effective antiretroviral drugs are, therefore, able to be made available to those who live with HIV. The national surveillance system has also been effective. The great efforts and resources which Thailand has dedicated to the fight against the epidemic have eventually paid off. In 2010, a plan was proposed to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission and Thailand has become the first country to be effective in this objective. Thailand therefore has become recognized as being the global leader in HIV prevention and treatment. The experience which Thailand has gained from the past and the current research and management strategies of the HIV epidemic has prepared the country for emerging strains of HIV-1 in the future.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

   volume = {23},
   number = {1},
   pages = {268},
   abstract = {Background: Most countries have enacted some restrictions to reduce social contacts to slow down disease transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. For nearly two years, individuals likely also adopted new behaviours to avoid pathogen exposure based on personal circumstances. We aimed to understand the way in which different factors affect social contacts - a critical step to improving future pandemic responses. Method(s): The analysis was based on repeated cross-sectional contact survey data collected in a standardized international study from 21 European countries between March 2020 and March 2022. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a clustered bootstrap by country and by settings (at home, at work, or in other settings). Where data were available, contact rates during the study period were compared with rates recorded prior to the pandemic. We fitted censored individual-level generalized additive mixed models to examine the effects of various factors on the number of social contacts. Result(s): The survey recorded 463,336 observations from 96,456 participants. In all countries where comparison data were available, contact rates over the previous two years were substantially lower than those seen prior to the pandemic (approximately from over 10 to < 5), predominantly due to fewer contacts outside the home. Government restrictions imposed immediate effect on contacts, and these effects lingered after the restrictions were lifted. Across countries, the relationships between national policy, individual perceptions, or personal circumstances determining contacts varied. Conclusion(s): Our study, coordinated at the regional level, provides important insights into the understanding of the factors associated with social contacts to support future infectious disease outbreak responses.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   journal = {Risk Management and Healthcare Policy},
   volume = {14},
   pages = {1165-1173},
   abstract = {Purpose: Willingness to work in disasters is context-specific and corresponds to the nature, magnitude, and threats posed by a particular public health emergency. None us is certain that our health professionals will continue to provide service should the COVID-19 pandemic crisis climb to its worst level. It was with this uncertainty in mind that this study was done to assess predictors of the unwillingness of health-care workers (HCWs) to continue providing their professional services during the climax of the COVID-19 crisis. Method(s): This was a facility-based descriptive cross-sectional study undertaken among 633 HCWsin western Ethiopia. Result(s): Overall, 205 (32.4%) providers said that they would be unwilling to continue work if COVID-19 peaked. Of these, 176 (27.9%) respondents reported that they would stop going in to work before they were at greatest risk. Statistical analysis performed to predict HCWs unwillingness' to continue work at peak COVID-19 showed male sex (AOR 11.4, 95% CI 8.32-12.6), younger age (AOR 25.3, 95% CI 4.61-40.67), lack of experience in handling similar pandemics (AOR 5.15, 95% CI 1.1-255), and low perceived level of hospital preparedness (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 0.80-5.21) were predictors of unwillingness. In accordance with the extended parallel-process model, higher threat perception (P<=0.001) and low efficacy perception (P<=0.040) were associated with unwillingness of the HCWs to continue working. Conclusion(s): The proportion of HCWs unwilling to continue their job during COVID-19 is sufficient to affect efforts tof fight the pandemic. As the question of whether our HCWs must risk themselves to treat COVID-19 patients does not have a uniform answer, working on predictors of potential unwillingness is of paramount importance.Copyright © 2021 Woyessa et al.},

   title = {Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures},
   journal = {EClinicalMedicine},
   volume = {21},
   pages = {100329},
   abstract = {Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Method(s): We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Finding(s): Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589.5, 49.3, and 37.5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2.2 million. Interpretation(s): Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)},

Its primary objective is to provide situational awareness and inform decisions on control responses. In the event of large-scale sustained emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists need to constantly update their aims and analytics with respect to the rapidly evolving emergence of new questions, data and findings in order to synthesize real-time evidence for policy decisions. In this Perspective, we share our views on the functional aims, rationale, data requirements and challenges of nowcasting at different stages of an epidemic, drawing on the ongoing COVID-19 experience. We highlight how recent advances in the computational and laboratory sciences could be harnessed to complement traditional approaches to enhance the scope, timeliness, reliability and utility of epidemic nowcasting.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature America, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has had serious wide-ranging effects on academic, occupational and other daily activities. Like other types of institutions, schools are facing unprecedented challenges. Students may face a variety of adverse consequences, including sleep disturbances and school bullying, if they are unable to adjust to the current learning and living environment. This study explored the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on school bullying. Method(s): A total of 5782 middle school students were enrolled in this multi-stage, cross-sectional study (3071 before and 2711 during the pandemic). The pre-pandemic group had a mean age of 14.9 +/- 1.73, the pandemic group of 14.75 +/- 1.47. Three models were set up using binary logistic regression to adjust for confounding variables (gender, school type, alcohol consumption, smoking, playing violent video games). Result(s): All types of bullying victimization and perpetration (physical, verbal, social and property bullying) were more common during the pandemic than before the pandemic. In terms of bullying victimization, property bullying victimization (crude odds ratio [OR]: 2.398, 95% CI: 2.014-2.854, p < 0.001; model 2 adjusted OR: 2.344, 95% CI: 1.966-2.795, p < 0.001; model 3 adjusted OR: 2.818, 95% CI: 2.292-3.464, p < 0.001) increased the most. In terms of bullying perpetration, verbal bullying perpetration (crude OR: 3.007, 95% CI: 2.448-3.693, p <0.001; model 2 adjusted OR: 2.954, 95% CI: 2.399-3.637, p < 0.001; model 3 adjusted OR:3.345, 95% CI: 2.703-4.139, p < 0.001) increased the most. Conclusion(s): This study corroborate the significance of the pandemic on traditional school bullying and suggests that we should further consider other types of bullying and establish and improve the response and prevention mechanisms during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent respiratory infectious disease (RID) outbreaks of influenza and the novel coronavirus have resulted in global pandemics. RIDs can trigger nosocomial infections if not adequately prevented., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to rate the adequacy of healthcare workers (HCWs) and hospital settings on RID prevention using unannounced standardized patients (USP) in clinical settings of hospital gateways., METHODS: Trained USPs visited 5 clinical settings: information desks, registration desks, two outpatient departments and the emergency departments in 10 hospitals across 3 cities of Inner Mongolia, China. USPs observed the hospital air ventilation and distance from the nearest hand-washing facilities to each clinical setting, then mimicked symptoms of either tuberculosis or influenza before observing the HCW's behavior. A total of 480 clinical-setting assessments were made by 19 USPs., RESULTS: The overall adequacy of triage services was 86.7% and for prevention of the spread of airborne droplets was 83.5%. Almost all hospitals offered adequate air ventilation. Compared to the information desk, adequacy of triage and preventing the spread of airborne droplets by physicians in the three clinical departments was less likely to be adequate. Triage services for USPs simulating symptoms of influenza were 2.6 times more likely to be adequate than for those simulating symptoms of tuberculosis but there was no significant difference in the prevention of the spread of airborne droplets., CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to improve respiratory infectious disease procedures in our study hospitals, especially in outpatient and emergency departments.},

   abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to assess Chinese public pandemic fatigue and potential influencing factors using an appropriate tool and provide suggestions to relieve this fatigue. Method(s): This study used a stratified sampling method by age and region and conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of citizens in Xi'an, China, from January to February 2022. A total of 1500 participants completed the questionnaire, which collected data on demographics, health status, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stressors, pandemic fatigue, COVID-19 fear, COVID-19 anxiety, personal resiliency, social support, community resilience, and knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19. Ultimately, 1354 valid questionnaires were collected, with a response rate of 90.0%. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine associations between pandemic fatigue and various factors. Result(s): Nearly half of the participants reported pandemic fatigue, the major manifestation of which was "being sick of hearing about COVID-19" (3.353 +/- 1.954). The logistic regression model indicated that COVID-19 fear (OR = 2.392, 95% CI = 1.804-3.172), sex (OR = 1.377, 95% CI = 1.077-1.761), the pandemic's impact on employment (OR = 1.161, 95% CI = 1.016-1.327), and COVID-19 anxiety (OR = 1.030, 95% CI = 1.010-1.051) were positively associated with pandemic fatigue. Conversely, COVID-19 knowledge (OR = 0.894, 95% CI = 0.837-0.956), COVID-19 attitude (OR = 0.866, 95% CI = 0.827-0.907), COVID-19 practice (OR = 0.943, 95% CI = 0.914-0.972), community resiliency (OR = 0.978, 95% CI = 0.958-0.999), and health status (OR = 0.982, 95% CI = 0.971-0.992) were negatively associated with pandemic fatigue. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of pandemic fatigue among the Chinese public was prominent. COVID-19 fear and COVID-19 attitude were the strongest risk factors and protective factors, respectively. These results indicated that the government should carefully utilize multi-channel promotion of anti-pandemic policies and knowledge.Copyright © 2022 Xin, Wang, Cao, Tian, Yang, Wang, Kang, Zhao, Feng, Wang, Luo, Liu and Wu.},

   pages = {e26558},
   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an abrupt reduction in the use of in-person health care, accompanied by a corresponding surge in the use of telehealth services. However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. Objective(s): The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. Method(s): We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. Result(s): In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). Conclusion(s): In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period. By end-June 2020, the combined outpatient and telehealth visits had recovered to prepandemic levels.Copyright © Stanley Xu, Sungching Glenn, Lina Sy, Lei Qian, Vennis Hong, Denison S Ryan, Steven Jacobsen.

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {761614},
   abstract = {Objective: The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly endangered public health and life safety, leading to new changes in people's housing needs. The purpose of this study is to establish design strategies that are suitable for China's Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs) in the post-pandemic era, and to identify the users' preferences for these strategies. Method(s): This study compiles a set of design requirements by means of a literature review and expert interviews. Three hundred ninety-five online and on-site questionnaires, based on the refined Kano model, were distributed to respondents to reveal their preferences for these strategies. The relationship between the different demographic variables, the preferences of design strategies, as well as the housing unit preferences of home-buyers were also verified by means of an actual project. Result(s): This study summarizes the four dimensions and 26 design strategies of MURBs in China during the post-pandemic era. These strategies are further extracted into 6 highly attractive, 5 high-value-added and 4 critical quality attributes. In terms of demographic variables, males need more social space, and the elderly need less office space and separate bathrooms in the master bedroom. Due to the impact of the epidemic, people with higher education levels are more required to work at home, and the overall demand for a home working environment is also higher. Conclusion(s): The home-buyers' preference survey reveals that the housing unit designed based on the refined Kano model is more attractive to home-buyers. The proposed approach can help to provide important and customized decisions to design firms, housing developers, and the government for MURBs planning and strategy formulation in the post-pandemic era in China. More in-depth user surveys in other regions and investigations into the cost assessment of these strategies might be further conducted in the future.Copyright © 2021 Xu and Juan.},

   journal = {Journal of Medical Internet Research},
   volume = {23},
   number = {1},
   pages = {24495},
   abstract = {Background: Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine measures have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease of the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns have been raised over the threat that these measures pose to mental health, especially the mental health of vulnerable groups, including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective(s): This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. Method(s): An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. Result(s): Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (?2 14=495.21; P<.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; ?=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; ?=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. Conclusion(s): Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Many U.S. State crisis standards of care (CSC) guidelines incorporated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), a sepsis-related severity score, in pandemic triage algorithms. However, SOFA performed poorly in COVID-19. Although disease-specific scores may perform better, their prognostic utility over time and in overcrowded care settings remains unclear., OBJECTIVES: We evaluated prognostication by the modified 4C (m4C) score, a COVID-19-specific prognosticator that demonstrated good predictive capacity early in the pandemic, as a potential tool to standardize triage across time and hospital-surge environments., DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study., SETTING: Two hundred eighty-one U.S. hospitals in an administrative healthcare dataset., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 298,379 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 were identified from March 1, 2020, to January 31, 2022. m4C scores were calculated from admission diagnosis codes, vital signs, and laboratory values., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital-surge index, a severity-weighted measure of COVID-19 caseload, was calculated for each hospital-month. Discrimination of in-hospital mortality by m4C and surge index-adjusted models was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Calibration was assessed by training models on early pandemic waves and measuring fit (deviation from bisector) in subsequent waves., RESULTS: From March 2020 to January 2022, 298,379 adults with COVID-19 were admitted across 281 U.S. hospitals. m4C adequately discriminated mortality in wave 1 (AUC 0.779 [95% CI, 0.769-0.789]); discrimination was lower in subsequent waves (wave 2: 0.772 [95% CI, 0.765-0.779]; wave 3: 0.746 [95% CI, 0.743-0.750]; delta: 0.707 [95% CI, 0.702-0.712]; omicron: 0.729 [95% CI, 0.721-0.738]). m4C demonstrated reduced calibration in contemporaneous waves that persisted despite periodic recalibration. Performance characteristics were similar with and without adjustment for surge., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mortality prediction by the m4C score remained robust to surge strain, making it attractive for when triage is most needed. However, score performance has deteriorated in recent waves. CSC guidelines relying on defined prognosticators, especially for dynamic disease processes like COVID-19, warrant frequent reappraisal to ensure appropriate resource allocation.},

   abstract = {Aim: Predicting mortality is important for intensivists, yet conventional disease severity scores may not consistently predict mortality in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to develop a machine learning-based mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Study Design: This study employs a retrospective and prospective longitudinal design. We retrospectively screened a total of 436 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The worst laboratory results and vital signs within the first 24 hours of ICU admission were recorded. We selected 29 inputs to develop a model using machine learning (ML), employing an artificial neural network (ANN) as the decision model. For model testing, we prospectively followed 108 patients from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022. Result(s): Our model predicted mortality with an 88% sensitivity and specificity. Conventional disease severity scores predicted mortality with lower sensitivity and specificity than our model did: 71% sensitivity and 70% specificity for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-2), and 75% sensitivity and 75% specificity for both the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-2) and APACHE-4. Our model demonstrated greater dis-criminative power for mortality with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.98) compared to conventional disease severity scores. Respiratory sup-port within the first 24 hours of ICU admission was identified as the most important factor affecting mortality. Conclusion(s): In scenarios such as epidemics, where conventional disease scores fall short in predicting mortality, machine learning models can be developed to reliably forecast disease outcomes.Copyright © 2024 Journal of Critical and Intensive Care by Kare Media.},

Quick and accurate 'emergency medical supplies is the key to win the 'battle'. Objective(s): To establish a set of intelligent decision-making system for medical material allocation in response to public health emergencies in medical institutions, so as to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of medical material emergency management by means of information, and effectively ensure a smooth and efficient epidemic prevention. Pareto analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of emergency medical supplies. Dijkstra algorithm, Floyd algorithm select the shortest path, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm; to solve the problem of multi-problem stacking. The function theory method of intelligent architecture is used to analyze the scheduling and prediction of emergency materials and the uncertain factors. Result(s): As the material support management of medical institutions is an important link to control the development of the outbreak, the operation efficiency of the whole system cannot meet the current 'tight time and heavy task' epidemic prevention and control needs. There is a state of untimely deployment, unscientific deployment, asymmetric information, insufficient preparation and no priority. Therefore, a material demand model based on the priority mechanism of epidemic outbreak prevention and control is established based on the two propositions that need to be solved urgently at present. Conclusion(s): In the case of shortage of resources and many uncertain factors, the guarantee of medical supplies lacks scientific allocation decision-making principle, and the emergency guarantee of medical supplies lacks intelligent traceability management system, so as to reduce internal consumption and improve the operation efficiency of the organization.},

   number = {SUPPL 1},
   abstract = {Introduction: The emergence of several variants is associated with COVID-19 rebound in many countries and regions with higher transmission advantage, and additional demand on medical resources including mechanical ventilators (MV). It can be challenging to estimate the demand by using infection rate of population, given the epidemiological response varies over time due to different factors such as pathogen variant, non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, we modeled the outbreak with time-varying epidemiological response to estimate the demand of MV in a dynamic way. Method(s): Confirmed cases and fatalities in six countries (US, Italy, UK, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil), were collected from COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University. We performed a Long-short term memory (LSTM) model to predict confirmed cases and fatalities at 8th day by using data for past 7 days. Data from Jan 22 to May 14, 2020 were split into training (80%) and validation (20%) dataset. Internal testing dataset was from May 16 to May 24, 2020, while Taiwan data from May9 to Jun16, 2021 were used as external testing. The root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) was used to evaluate the model performance. Then daily additional demand of MV for COVID-19 can be estimated by using below equation: Daily MV demand = (daily confirmed cases x hospitalization rate x ventilation rate). Result(s): The average RMSLE for confirmed cases and fatalities of six modeling countries were 0.08 and 0.13 respectively. For Taiwan confirmed cases was much higher than modeling countries (0.26), whereas slightly increased in fatalities (0.18). The figure also showed that our model captured the systematic variation in number of new cases per day in Taiwan and estimate additional 181 MV were needed in peak day. Conclusion(s): Our results can be of help to indicate the time-varying trend of COVID-19 and assist management team to estimate dynamic demand of MV for different regions. The early warning to government can leave more time for public decision-making. (Figure Presented).},

   journal = {Social Science and Medicine},
   volume = {343},

   abstract = {Prior to the pandemic, studies demonstrated the mainly protective role of structural social capital on all-cause mortality, less evidence had been found for a protective role for cognitive social capital. However, some findings from the early stage of the pandemic suggest that civic participation and group affiliation may be associated with more COVID-19-related deaths, as was interpersonal trust. Thus, the study aimed to verify indicators of individual social capital as risk factors for 7.6-year all-cause mortality before COVID-19 pandemic and 1.6-year all-cause mortality during of the pandemic among men and women aged 50+ years in Poland. The Polish part of the COURAGE in Europe cross-sectional baseline study was conducted in 2011. The analysis included 2913 face-to-face interviews with randomly selected community-dwelling individuals. Information about deaths was obtained from the State Systems Department on Oct 7, 2021. Various aspects of structural and cognitive social capital were measured. The Cox proportional hazard models were used. Before the pandemic, a protective effect of structural (formal and informal social participation) and cognitive social capital (trust in family, trust in co-workers) on the risk of death was observed in women. However, a negative effect of cognitive social capital (trust in strangers) was found for women and men. No positive effect of social capital during the pandemic after controlling for the health-related characteristics was found. A negative effect of generalized trust on all-cause mortality during the pandemic was discerned for men, a negative effect of the level of one's social network was found in women. The observed patterns of relationships were totally different for analyzed periods of time, and different for men and women. Consequently, planning of social interventions directed towards middle and older age groups should consider various actions for men and women separately. The need for continuous evaluation of implemented social interventions was emphasized.Copyright © 2024 The Authors},

   title = {Habit formation of preventive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study of physical distancing and hand washing},
   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {22},
   number = {1},
   pages = {1588},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and hand washing have been used as effective means to reduce virus transmission in the Netherlands. However, these measures pose a societal challenge as they require people to change their customary behaviours in various contexts. The science of habit formation is potentially useful for informing policy-making in public health, but the current literature largely overlooked the role of habit in predicting and explaining these preventive behaviours. Our research aimed to describe habit formation processes of physical distancing and hand washing and to estimate the influences of habit strength and intention on behavioural adherence. METHOD(S): A longitudinal survey was conducted between July and November 2020 on a representative Dutch sample (n = 800). Respondents reported their intentions, habit strengths, and adherence regarding six context-specific preventive behaviours on a weekly basis. Temporal developments of the measured variables were visualized, quantified, and mapped onto five distinct phases of the pandemic. Regression models were used to test the effects of intention, habit strength, and their interaction on behavioural adherence. RESULT(S): Dutch respondents generally had strong intentions to adhere to all preventive measures and their adherence rates were between 70% and 90%. They also self-reported to experience their behaviours as more automatic over time, and this increasing trend in habit strength was more evident for physical-distancing than for hand washing behaviours. For all six behaviours, both intention and habit strength predicted subsequent adherence (all ps < 2e-16). In addition, the predictive power of intention decreased over time and was weaker for respondents with strong habits for physical distancing when visiting supermarkets (B = -0.63, p <.0001) and having guests at home (B = -0.54, p <.0001) in the later phases of the study, but not for hand washing. CONCLUSION(S): People's adaptations to physical-distancing and hand washing measures involve both intentional and habitual processes. For public health management, our findings highlight the importance of using contextual cues to promote habit formation, especially for maintaining physical-distancing practices. For habit theories, our study provides a unique dataset that covers multiple health behaviours in a critical real-world setting.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the impact of media trust on epidemic prevention motivation and behaviors based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and to evaluate the moderation effect of personal epidemic experience, which focused on the differences in two groups with or without epidemic experience. Method(s): The exogenous constructs and PMT model and scale were constructed through literature analysis, and a web-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 428 individuals aged above 18years in China. Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing were performed in SPSS 26 and SmartPLS 3. Result(s): Traditional media trust accounted for the largest weight in media trust (w=0.492, p-value < 0.001), followed by social media (w=0.463, p-value < 0.001), and interpersonal communication (w=0.290, p-value < 0.001). Media trust was positively and significantly related to both threat appraisal (beta=0.210, p-value < 0.001) and coping appraisal (beta=0.260, p-value < 0.001). Threat appraisal (beta=0.105, p-value < 0.05) and coping appraisal (beta=0.545, p-value < 0.001) were positively and significantly related to epidemic prevention motivation, which positively and significantly related to epidemic prevention behaviors (beta=0.492, p-value < 0.001). The R2 values of epidemic prevention motivation and behavior are 0.350 and 0.240, respectively, indicating an acceptable explanation. Multiple-group analysis revealed five significant differences in paths between the two groups, indicating personal epidemic experience acting as a slight moderator on these paths. Conclusion(s): Traditional media trust and social media trust were the important elements in COVID-19 prevention and control, and public health departments and governments should ensure the accuracy and reliability of information from traditional and social media. Simultaneously, the media should balance threat information and efficacy information in order to generate the public's prevention motivation and behaviors.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Su, Meng and Zhang.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a major virus outbreak in the twenty-first century, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. METHOD(S): We performed a cross-sectional study based on the results of an online survey. The survey was conducted 1 month after the outbreak (February 18-29, 2020) and repeated at the time of resuming activity (April 8-14, 2020). The 15-item Death Anxiety Scale (T-DAS) was used to assess the degree of death anxiety, and the Chinese version of PTSD checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), for PTSD symptom clusters. Through convenient sampling, a total of 7678 cases were collected. RESULT(S): Our findings showed that even after the lockdown was lifted, the prevalence of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and death anxiety remained significantly high in the general population affected by the outbreak. Regression model analysis showed that PTSD was significantly associated with age>50years, contact history/living community, poor health status of participants, past traumatic experience (PTE), and medical occupation. Moreover, death anxiety mediated the relationship between life-threatening PTE and PTSD, indicating that reducing death anxiety could buffer the negative effects of PTE on PTSD. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the lifting of the lockdown, long-term adverse psychological effects remain in the affected general population. The management of mental health after major public health events is important, and high-risk groups such as the elderly and healthcare workers should receive targeted interventions. In addition, the study suggests that methods for alleviating death anxiety must be included in plans to manage the psychological impact of public health emergencies.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).},

We aimed to explore the risk factors of 14-day and 28-day mortality and develop a model for predicting 14-day and 28-day survival probability among adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19., METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, we examined 828 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 12 and February 9, 2020. Among the 828 patients, 516 and 186 consecutive patients admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively. A total of 126 patients hospitalized in Central Hospital of Wuhan were enrolled in a second external validation cohort. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory measures; treatment; proximate causes of death; and 14-day and 28-day mortality are described. Patients' data were collected by reviewing the medical records, and their 14-day and 28-day outcomes were followed up., RESULTS: Of the 828 patients, 146 deaths were recorded until May 18, 2020. In the training set, multivariate Cox regression indicated that older age, lactate dehydrogenase level over 360 U/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio higher than 8.0, and direct bilirubin higher than 5.0 mumol/L were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Nomogram scoring systems for predicting the 14-day and 28-day survival probability of patients with COVID-19 were developed and exhibited strong discrimination and calibration power in the two external validation cohorts (C-index, 0.878 and 0.839)., CONCLUSION: Older age, high lactate dehydrogenase level, evaluated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and high direct bilirubin level were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in adult hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The nomogram system based on the four factors revealed good discrimination and calibration, suggesting good clinical utility.},

Modelling studies indicated that highly effective contact tracing and case isolation were enough to contain the spread of COVID-19 at the early stages, but this has not been validated in real world contexts., What is added by this report?, Integrated case finding approaches, including outpatient monitoring, exposed people quarantining, and contact tracing, effectively contained the spread of COVID-19 in a densely populated district in Shanghai Municipality, China. Active case-finding involving quarantine of exposed persons and contact tracing could reduce the time from symptom onset to COVID-19 diagnosis, thus reducing the risk of local transmission., What are the implications for public health practice?, Active case-finding should be prioritized as an effective approach to minimize the risk of local transmission in future pandemics. Integrated COVID-19 case finding approaches applied in Shanghai may inform public health policy in other regions where strict lockdown is not applicable.

   abstract = {Background: The Fangcang shelter hospital has gradually become the primary management mode in China's fight against this Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020. In early 2022, the Fangcang shelter hospital management model was successfully applied to the new outbreak of COVID-19 in Shanghai also. Although Fangcang shelter hospitals are no longer the prevailing mode of prevention of COVID-19, the management experience of Shanghai makeshift hospitals is worthy of reference for public health. Method(s): The authors conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of Hall 6-2 of the Shanghai National Convention and Exhibition Center Fangcang shelter hospital. The whole hall of the Fangcang shelter hospital was managed by the one hospital, and the inclusion of third-party management personnel alleviated the shortage of medical personnel human resources. Through practice, a new procedure for treating batch infected people was introduced. Result(s): By optimizing ward management, 72 on-duty doctors, 360 on-duty nurses, 3 sense-control administrators, and 15 administrators cured 18,574 infected people in 40 days, and created a record of a doctor managing 700 infected people without compromising the quality of treatment. There have been no deaths and no complaints from the infected people located in Hall 6-2 of the Shanghai National Convention and Exhibition Center Fangcang shelter hospital.
