   abstract = {Introduction: The situation generated in the health system by the COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a crisis involving the necessity to cancel non-urgent and oncologic activity in the operating room and in day-to-day practice. As the situation continues, the need to reinstate attention for patients with chronic pain grows. The restoration of this activity has to begin with on-site appointments and possible surgical procedures. On-site clinical activity has to guarantee the safety of patients and health workers. Objective(s): The objective of this review was to evaluate how to manage activity in pain units, considering the scenario generated by the pandemic and the implications of chronic pain on the immune system and proposed pharmacological and interventional therapies. Method(s): Besides the established general recommendations (physical distance, surgical masks, gloves, etc.), we established specific recommendations that will allow patient treatment and relieve the disruption of the immune response. It is important to highlight the use of opioids with the least influence in the immune system. Further, individualized corticoid use, risk assessment, reduced immune suppression, and dose adjustment should take patient needs into account. In this scenario, we highlight the use of radiofrequency and neuromodulation therapies, techniques that do not interfere with the immune response. Conclusion(s): We describe procedures to implement these recommendations for individual clinical situations, the therapeutic possibilities and safety guidelines for each center, and government recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 World Institute of Pain},

   abstract = {Individuals infected by the Covid-19 potentially are at risk of health and economic well-being. Today, the Covid-19 is a global issue, and the world economy can be interpreted as almost at the standstill. In this context, this study aims to discuss the potential first reactions of short and long term global economic impacts of the pandemic through sectors by assessing its costs according to the data announced for both the world and Turkey. In addition, this study tries to put forth possible economic and political scenarios for the post-pandemic world. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a review article that summarizes the current reports and discussions about the economic consequences of this historical event, and tries to make some inferences considering them. Result(s): This pandemic has severe adverse effects on the employees, customers, supply chains and financial markets, in brief, most probably it will cause a global economic recession. Nevertheless, due to the uncertainty of the end of this pandemic, both the length and scale of this contraction are not predictable. Conclusion(s): It takes a while for the world economy to recover from the contraction. It seems that this pandemic will lead to a permanent shift in the world and its politics, especially in health, security, trade, employment, agriculture, manufacturing goods production and science policies. Since this new world might provide great opportunities for some countries that did not dominate world production before, governments should develop new strategies to adjust the new world order without much delay.Copyright © TUBITAK.},

   abstract = {Background Applied epidemiological models are used in predicting future trends of diseases, for the basic understanding of disease and health dynamics, and to improve the measurement of health indicators. Mapping the research outputs of epidemiological modelling studies concerned with transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions in Africa will help to identify the areas with substantial levels of research activities, areas with gaps, and research output trends. Methods A scoping review of applied epidemiological models of infectious disease studies that involved first or last authors affiliated to African institutions was conducted. Eligible studies were those concerned with the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions. The review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications up to the end of April 2020. Results Of the 5927 publications identified, 181 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 143 publications with first authors having an African institutional affiliation (AIA), while 81 had both first and last authors with an AIA. The publication authors were found to be predominantly affiliated with institutions based in South Africa and Kenya. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola virus disease were found to be the most researched infectious diseases. There has been a gradual increase in research productivity across Africa especially in the last ten years, with several collaborative efforts spread both within and beyond Africa. Conclusions Research productivity in applied epidemiological modelling studies of infectious diseases may have increased, but there remains an under-representation of African researchers as leading authors. The study findings indicate a need for the development of research capacity through supporting existing institutions in Africa and promoting research funding that will address local health priorities.Copyright © 2021 Adetokunboh et al.},

   abstract = {The Covid 19 pandemic led to major changes at the individual, organisational and institutional levels of policy, productive functions, and organising. During Covid 19 morbidity, public institutions enforced social isolation, mandatory self-isolation, quarantines, and administrative regulatory lockdowns, which led to a movement away from the physical, material world and into an all-consuming digital universe. With growing interest in work-from-home (WFH) opportunities, this article provides an integrative review of 107 papers. It comprises the bibliometric analysis and manual review of the articles, on the basis of which we present an elaborative discussion and agenda for future research. According to the analysis, WFH looks a tad of a double-edged sword in that it may have major but unintended repercussions for institutions, and organizations as well as hidden, positive as well as negative consequences for individuals/employees. One of the significant insight from our analysis was the absence of HR function's strategic or operational input or oversight during corporate WFH strategies. We suggest several theoretical frameworks for further developing, theorizing, and empirically testing various aspects of WFH. Further, we recognise that WFH is becoming increasingly visible as a result of the pandemic scenario and significant technical advancements, which must be reflected in the research. Finally, because WFH represents a significant disruption in how organizations produce work and manage it, we propose employee and managerial consequences as future research agendas.

   pages = {65-92},
   abstract = {Mathematical models have a long history in epidemiological research, and as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, research on mathematical modeling became imperative and very influential to understand the epidemiological dynamics of disease spreading. Mathematical models describing dengue fever epidemiological dynamics are found back from 1970. Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne infection caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection, it is a major international public health concern. Although most of the cases are asymptomatic or mild, the disease immunological response is complex, with severe disease linked to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) - a disease augmentation phenomenon where pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection. Here, we present a 10-year systematic review on mathematical models for dengue fever epidemiology. Specifically, we review multi-strain frameworks describing host-to-host and vector-host transmission models and within-host models describing viral replication and the respective immune response. Following a detailed literature search in standard scientific databases, different mathematical models in terms of their scope, analytical approach and structural form, including model validation and parameter estimation using empirical data, are described and analyzed. Aiming to identify a consensus on infectious diseases modeling aspects that can contribute to public health authorities for disease control, we revise the current understanding of epidemiological and immunological factors influencing the transmission dynamics of dengue. This review provide insights on general features to be considered to model aspects of real-world public health problems, such as the current epidemiological scenario we are living in.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged by the end of 2019 and spread as pandemic on March 2020 worldwide. Subsequently, it has universally disturbed the medical education and health systems. It leads to lethal circumstances, which become encounters for medical education. Therefore, there is a need to ensure the integrity and firmness of the medical education process and safe lecture delivery. Also, it is essential to re-examine structuring the workforce capacity with the condition of the swiftly altering healthcare system globally and worldwide requirements. A narrative review was conducted to reveal the critical aspects of medical education that need to be reinforced during the post-COVID-19, focusing on building an effective healthcare workforce. It included and examined the relevant papers using search terms in PubMed and Web of Science. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has unlocked a creative horizon in accepting an appropriate educational methodology to convey safe health professionals, with the human-centered ethical value of professional skill and expertise embedded with humane behavior. A direct, hands-on scientific practice should be sustained with the usual methods to develop graduates' skills and experience and ensure the quality of medical education. However, to combat the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools and other health profession education institutions globally must adjust their curriculum and educational strategies through innovative distant learning modes, including extended reality technology, e-learning tools, and simulation amenities. From experience gained through a pandemic, medical schools should perform best practices for a dynamic shift to blended learning and assessment. Moreover, medical educators should develop practical guidelines or protective actions to conduct clinical teaching without negotiating safety, health, and quality of medical education.Copyright © 2022 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread at an alarming speed, and effective treatment for the disease is still lacking. The body of evidence on COVID-19 has been increasing at an impressive pace, creating the need for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are regarded unsuitable because they have a narrow scope and are very time consuming. Objective(s): This study aimed to explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We performed a PubMed search to analyze the titles, keywords, and abstracts of published papers on COVID-19. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted a trend analysis to understand the temporal changes in research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographic origin. Result(s): Based on our search, we identified 16,670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these, 6 articles were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on patients with COVID-19. We identified 14 main research topics, of which the most common topics were health care responses (2812/16,670, 16.86%) and clinical manifestations (1828/16,670, 10.91%). We found an increasing trend for research on clinical manifestations and protective measures and a decreasing trend for research on disease transmission, epidemiology, health care response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. The overall median JIF was 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9), and we found that the JIF for these publications declined over time. The top countries producing research were the United States, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Conclusion(s): In less than 6 months since the novel coronavirus was first detected, a remarkably high number of research articles on COVID-19 have been published. Here, we discuss and present the temporal changes in the available COVID-19 research during the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings may aid researchers and policy makers to form a structured view of the current COVID-19 evidence base and provide further research directions.Copyright ©Andreas Alga, Oskar Eriksson, Martin Nordberg.},

Method(s): The peer-reviewed literature published between 1 January and 30 April 2020 on COVID-19 in PubMed was searched. Estimates of the incubation period, serial interval and reproduction number for COVID-19 were obtained and compared. Result(s): A total of 86 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 33 estimated the mean incubation period (4-7 days) and 15 included estimates of the serial interval (mean 4-8 days; median length 4-5 days). Fifty-two studies estimated the reproduction number. Although reproduction number estimates ranged from 0.3 to 14.8, in 33 studies (63%), they fell between 2 and 3. Discussion(s): Studies calculating the incubation period and effective reproduction number were published from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of the study period (30 April 2020); however, most of the studies calculating the serial interval were published in April 2020. The calculated incubation period was similar over the study period and in different settings, whereas estimates of the serial interval and effective reproduction number were setting-specific. Estimates of the serial interval were shorter at the end of the study period as increasing evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission was documented and as jurisdictions enacted outbreak control measures. Estimates of the effective reproduction number varied with the setting and the underlying model assumptions. Early analysis of epidemic parameters provides vital information to inform the outbreak response.Copyright (c) 2021 The authors; licensee World Health Organization.},

   journal = {Dubai Medical Journal},
   volume = {3},
   number = {2},
   pages = {44-49},
   abstract = {Background: As we live in an interconnected globalized world, people and the diseases they carry can be easily transmitted to any place in a matter of hours. SARS-CoV-2 began like all new viruses with an ordinary moment when a cluster of patients admitted to a hospital with pneumonia turned out to have a new strain of coronavirus. The virus's high transmissibility made the epidemic in China turn into a global pandemic with an ongoing daily reporting of new cases and deaths. However, as fast as viruses spread, the detection of pandemics and taking early measures has become much easier due to the advancement of science in today's world. The early responses and measures adopted by China, such as early reporting and situation monitoring, large-scale surveillance, and preparation of medical facilities and supplies, were all successful in reducing the epidemic in China generally and in the epicenter Wuhan specifically. The purpose of this review is to focus on the effectiveness of the measures taken by the Chinese government to stop COVID-19 spreading by comparing the country's response to SARS and CO-VID-19 outbreaks, which will provide an example for the communities, health managers, and leaders of countries to follow on how to prepare, detect, and respond to potential outbreaks. Method(s): For this article, epidemic preparedness and management strategies under comparison were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) frameworks and guidelines. Other data related to COVID-19 and reported cases were taken from more than 25 official public health organization reports and relevant articles using various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct). Result(s): Working on developing resilient systems against infectious diseases should be one of the top priorities of any country. China embraced resilience in its battle against COVID-19 and proved its capability to cope with the outbreak crisis. Despite succeeding in altering the course of the outbreak, healthcare experts warned about possible epidemic recurrence and stressed the need for caution as the pandemic is still ongoing and most of the infected cases are presenting with only mild symptoms.Copyright © 2020 Dubai Medical Journal.

   journal = {JMIR public health and surveillance},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {e42678},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contact tracing (CT) represented one of the core activities for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. Several guidance documents were developed by international public health agencies and national authorities on the organization of COVID-19 CT activities. While most research on CT focused on the use digital tools or relied on modelling techniques to estimate the efficacy of interventions, poor evidence is available on the real-world implementation of CT strategies and on the organizational models adopted during the initial phase of the emergency to set up CT activities. OBJECTIVE(S): We aimed to provide a comprehensive picture of the organizational aspects of CT activities during the first wave of the pandemic through the systematic identification and description of CT strategies used in different settings during the period from March to June 2020. METHOD(S): A systematic review of published studies describing organizational models of COVID-19 CT strategies developed in real-world settings was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched. Studies not providing a description of the organizational aspects of CT strategies and studies reporting or modelling theoretical strategies or focusing on the description of digital technologies' properties were excluded. Quality of reporting was assessed by using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication Checklist for Population Health and Policy. We developed a narrative synthesis, using a conceptual framework to map the extracted studies broken down by target population. RESULT(S): We retrieved a total of 1638 studies, of which 17 were included in the narrative synthesis; 7 studies targeted the general population and 10 studies described CT activities carried out in specific population subgroups. Our review identified some common elements across studies used to develop CT activities, including decentralization of CT activities, involvement of trained nonpublic health resources (eg, university students or civil servants), use of informatics tools for CT management, interagency collaboration, and community engagement. CT strategies implemented in the workplace envisaged a strong collaboration with occupational health services. Outreach activities were shown to increase CT efficiency in susceptible groups, such as people experiencing homelessness. Data on the effectiveness of CT strategies are scarce, with only few studies reporting on key performance indicators. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the lack of systematically collected data on CT effectiveness, our findings can provide some indication for the future planning and development of CT strategies for infectious disease control, mainly in terms of coordination mechanisms and the use of human and technical resources needed for the rapid development of CT activities. Further research on the organizational models of CT strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic would be required to contribute to a more robust evidence-making process.Copyright ©Anna Maria Vincenza Amicosante, Annalisa Rosso, Fabio Bernardini, Elisa Guglielmi, Erica Eugeni, Filippo Da Re, Giovanni Baglio.

   abstract = {Background: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Iran, the control and management of the epidemic were headed by the National Headquarter for the Control of COVID-19 Epidemic through setting up different scientific committees, including the COVID-19 National Epidemiology Committee. The present study reviews the missions, structures, achievements, and challenges of the Epidemiology Committee. Study design: A rapid review Methods: All relevant reports, documents, guidelines, published literature, and surveillance data related to the establishment, visions, missions, roles, activities, and outputs of the COVID-19 Epidemiology Committee were critically reviewed in this study. Result(s): The efforts of the committee's working groups may have impacted improvements in data registration/usage, provincial data quality at provincial levels, and perception of the epidemic situation in the provinces. The committees have also played role in informing the policies in different stages of the epidemic through routine or problem-based data/evidence analyses, epidemic investigations, and mathematical modeling. Conclusion(s): The structure and experience gained by the committee can be used in similar situations within and outside the country. To further improve the impacts of our activities, it is essential to have effective interaction, collaboration, and data flow between the committee and a broad range of organizations within and outside the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Context: The unprecedented health care scenario caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized urology practice worldwide. Objective(s): To review the recommendations by the international and European national urological associations/societies (UASs) on prioritization strategies for both oncological and nononcological procedures released during the current emergency scenario. Evidence Acquisition: Each UAS official website was searched between April 8 and 18, 2020, to retrieve any document, publication, or position paper on prioritization strategies regarding both diagnostic and therapeutic urological procedures, and any recommendations on the use of telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery. We collected detailed information on all urological procedures, stratified by disease, priority (higher vs lower), and patient setting (outpatient vs inpatient). Then, we critically discussed the implications of such recommendations for urology practice in both the forthcoming "adaptive" and the future "chronic" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence Synthesis: Overall, we analyzed the recommendations from 13 UASs, of which four were international (American Urological Association, Confederation Americana de Urologia, European Association of Urology, and Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand) and nine national (from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, and the UK). In the outpatient setting, the procedures that are likely to impact the future burden of urologists' workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, some UASs recommended special precautions to perform minimally invasive surgery, while others outlined the potential role of telemedicine to optimize resources in the current and future scenarios. Conclusion(s): The expected changes will put significant strain on urological units worldwide regarding the overall workload of urologists, internal logistics, inflow of surgical patients, and waiting lists. In light of these predictions, urologists should strive to leverage this emergency period to reshape their role in the future. Patient Summary: Overall, there was a large consensus among different urological associations/societies regarding the prioritization of most urological procedures, including those in the outpatient setting, urological emergencies, and many inpatient surgeries for both oncological and nononcological conditions. On the contrary, some differences were found regarding specific cancer surgeries (ie, radical cystectomy for higher-risk bladder cancer and nephrectomy for larger organ-confined renal masses), potentially due to different prioritization criteria and/or health care contexts. In the future, the outpatient procedures that are likely to impact the burden of urologists' workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. There was a large consensus among the different urological associations/societies regarding the prioritization of most urological procedures. However, some differences were found regarding specific cancer surgeries (ie, radical cystectomy for higher-risk bladder cancer and nephrectomy for larger organ-confined renal masses). In the future, the procedures that are likely to impact the burden of urologists' workload most are prostate biopsies, elective procedures for benign conditions, elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.Copyright © 2020 European Association of Urology},

This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on the impact of social distancing measures on the epidemic and discusses the implementation of these measures in Brazil. Articles on the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 were selected from the PubMed, medRXiv and bioRvix databases. Federal and state legislation was analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Brazil. Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, particularly when implemented in conjunction with the isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts. Therefore, social distancing measures, and social protection policies to guarantee the sustainability of these measures, should be implemented. To control COVID-19 in Brazil, it is also crucial that epidemiological monitoring is strengthened at all three levels of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). This includes evaluating and usingsupplementary indicators to monitor the progression of the pandemic and the effect of the control measures, increasing testing capacity, and making disaggregated notificationsand testing resultstransparentand broadly available.},

   abstract = {Currently, there are several mathematical models that have been developed to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus. Comment: Mathematical models are highly relevant for making objective and effective decisions to control and eradicate the disease. These models used for COVID-19 have supported and will continue to provide information for the selection and implementation of programs and public policies that prevent associated complications, reduce the speed of the virus spread and minimize the occurrence of severe cases of the disease that may collapse health systems.Copyright © 2020.

   abstract = {This document aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to estimate the per-sonal protective equipments (PPE), medical devices, and drugs commonly used in the Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review and gray literature assessment was performed, and the evidence was categorized using the GRADE methodology. Then a predictive model was built to support the estimation of resources needed during 30 days of the pandemic. In the development of these recommendations, 33 publications were included, with variable quality of evidence (low to very low quality). They refer to the use of PPE according to the risk of exposure; management and reuse of PPE, and the stock of drugs and medical devices needed for the care of patients with COVID-19. It is important to remark the difficult in estimating and managing the number of essential supplies and equipment required during a pandemic. The model allowed us to predict the resources required to provide critical care during 30 days of pandemic activity. Given the constant evolution of COVID-19, these recommendations might change as evidence evolves.Copyright © 2020, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background and objective: Many trends are being raised across global countries for the novel disease 'Corona-Virus' (COVID-19). Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders are implemented worldwide to reduce the proliferation rate of this virus. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it as 'pandemic,' its emergent state prevails worldwide. As a successor of SARS-CoV-2, higher destruction has been enforced on human lives intolerably. However, the prior detection could help shorten this disease's proliferation rate; various prediction and diagnosis tools are useful with artificial intelligence. These tools might assist in preventive measures against the virus infection. The main objective of this article is two-folded. First, to explore the application of soft computing techniques, the overview of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), internet of things (IoT), and support vector machines (SVM) have been interpreted concerning COVID-19 analysis. Next, to analyze performance, a comparative study has been represented to show that the soft computing models outperform some of the prevailed analytical models on the COVID-19. Method(s): To forecast and predict a pandemic outbreak, Cauchy distribution probabilistic approaches are applied. An extensive study of mathematical and theoretical, and approximate models based on soft computing done for COVID-19 prediction. Consecutively, some curious factor such as infection rate based on age groups could be forecasted. Also, Sick rate, and immunity rate during the quarantine period have been analyzed for nearly 500 sample tests taken globally. Result(s): This research scopes for extensive analysis of COVID-19 entitled to health policies. It would facilitate the technocrats to develop heuristic models for this wide-spread disease through forecasting of real-time data. It also addresses the statistical analysis of COVID-19 articles and future scope for technocrats regarding COVID-19 prediction and diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objective: We provide an in-depth understanding of how governance and decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic has been empirically characterized in the literature to identify gaps in research and highlight areas that require further inquiry. Method(s): We searched peer-reviewed publications using empirical data published between Jan 1, 2020 and Jan 31, 2022 in three electronic databases to examine the process of governance and decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two authors independently screened the records and 24 publications were extracted for the review. Result(s): Governance is analyzed by its level at national, sub-national, community and by its aspects of process, determinants and performance. While different methodological approaches are used, governance is conceptualized in four ways 1) characteristics and elements, 2) leadership, 3) application of power and 4) models or arrangements of governance. Conclusion(s): For future pandemic preparedness, there is a need for more empirical research using a unified conceptual approach to governance, which integrates decision-making processes and can guide governance structures and mechanisms across different countries and contexts. We call for more inclusivity in who performs the research on governance and where.Copyright © 2024 Asthana, Mukherjee, Phelan and Standley.},

   abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has created the current pandemic, has caused a worldwide worry. Different countries have since enforced varying levels of lockdowns and guidelines for their populations to follow in a serious effort to mitigate the spread. Up until recently, the majority of these regulations and policies were established on the assumption that the dominant routes of transmission of this virus are through droplets and fomite contact. However, there is now a substantial amount of research pointing towards the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne means. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently recognized this, which poses the question of whether our collective methods of lessening transmission risk and keeping people safe have been sufficient. This paper is a comprehensive review of the evidence on SARS-CoV-2 being an airborne disease, through different epidemiological, experimental, and animal-model based published research. Studies opposing this evidence have also been discussed. The majority of these studies are favoring the high plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, and therefore the many implications of aerosol transmission have been discussed in this paper to suggest effective mitigation and control strategies.Copyright © 2021 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

   pages = {S347},
   abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to describe how health economic analyses were assessed in France to appraise COVID-19 treatments in a context of parametric and structural uncertainty. Method(s): Descriptive Review of economic opinions from the French HTA body (HAS), published from January 2020 to June 1st 2023 on COVID-19 treatments. A focus on uncertainty management is made, considering epidemiological context and ability of modelling to quantify and explore uncertainty to guide decision making. Result(s): Five economic opinions published by HAS on COVID-19 treatments were analyzed concerning 3 treatments (including prophylaxis) to prevent severe forms of COVID-19. Economic modeling relied on 1 Markov model, and 3 decision tree+Markov models, all modeling ambulatory and hospital care for COVID-19, then long-COVID and death. No one modeled inter-individual transmissions nor reinfections. HAS' economic committee wasn't able to conclude on efficiency of the products due to global major uncertainty. Global major uncertainty objected were based on the following: Systemic uncertainty due to epidemiological context: number and severity of epidemic waves, clinical data temporality and transposability, evolution of level of care through time and loss of efficacy of treatments. Modelling and methodological uncertainty due to assumptions made, considering lack of data and knowledge in the COVID-19 context. However, the committee did not invalidate the methodology for any of the manufacturers' analyses, neither for cost-utility analyses (N=4) nor budget impact analyses (N=4), and for 2 opinions, analyses were qualified as "well documented". Conclusion(s): While modelling was used by Ministry of Health in the early COVID-19 pandemic to guide public health measure in France, authorities now show stronger risk-aversion towards economic models' uncertainty. HAS' clinical committee was able to conclude on COVID-19 treatments' efficacy, and other HTA agencies such as NICE concludes on efficiency whereas HAS' economic committee did not. However real-world data on COVID-19 are available to tackle parametric and contextual uncertainty.Copyright © 2023},

Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the extent and correlates of missed appointments among adults with chronic disease conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Ethiopia., METHODS: A retrospective chart review and cross-sectional survey were conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. A total of 1833 patients with common chronic disease were included by using a stratified systematic random sampling technique. Web-based data collection was done using Kobo collect. The data were explored using descriptive statistical techniques, the rate of missed appointments s before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was determined. A negative binomial regression model was fitted to identify the factors of missed appointment. An incidence rate ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of the final model were reported., RESULTS: The rate of missed appointments was 12.5% (95% CI: 11.13%, 14.20%) before the pandemic, increased to 26.8% (95% CI: 24.73%, 28.82%) during the pandemic (p-value < 0.001). Fear of COVID-19 infection and lack of transport was the most common reasons for missing appointments. Older patients (Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (AIRR) = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.001; 1.015), having treatment follow up more than 5 years (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.103; 1.69), shorter frequency of follow-up (AIRR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63; 2.49), covering expense out of pocket (AIRR = 2.26, 95%CI: 1.41; 2.95), having a sedentary lifestyle (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.12; 1.71), and history of missed appointments before COVID-19 pandemic (AIRR = 4.27, 95%CI: 3.35; 5.43) were positively associated with the incidence of missed appointments., CONCLUSION: The rate of missed appointment increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, longer duration of follow up, more frequent follow-up, out-of-pocket expenditure for health service, history of poor follow-up, and sedentary lifestyle had positive relationship with missed appointments during the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to give special emphasis to individuals with these risk factors while designing and implementing policies and strategies for peoples with chronic diseases to ensure the continuity of care and to avoid the long-term impact on their health.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations, such as transplant patients, were at greater risk than the regular population. In order to protect these populations, transplant centers enacted new guidelines. We approach this review by looking at how different transplant regions responded to COVID-19 and analyze the unifying themes that have proven invaluable in the subsequent waves., RECENT FINDINGS: We noticed that most elective surgeries including living donor transplant operations were suspended in most countries. The response to deceased donor transplants varied between countries: in some deceased donor transplants continued with modified donor and recipient criteria, while in other countries this surgery was suspended. There was a general trend of decreasing or holding antimetabolites, treating the virus with hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin, and converting outpatient clinics to virtual clinics., SUMMARY: We learned how to carefully select donors and recipients, tailor immunosuppressant regiments, and implement telemedicine. The kidney recipient population can be effectively managed in times of crisis with appropriate accommodations and measures. This review can be a model for the transplant community for future pandemics. Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

Rapid assessment and early warning are essential for outbreak analysis in response to serious public health events. This paper reviews the current model analysis methods and conclusions from both micro and macro perspectives. The establishment of a comprehensive assessment model, and the use of model analysis prediction, is very efficient for the early warning of infectious diseases. This would significantly improve global surveillance capacity, particularly in developing regions, and improve basic training in infectious diseases and molecular epidemiology.},

Experiences from global pandemics such as Coronavirus disease-2019 have shown collapse of healthcare infrastructure and spikes in mortality because of shortage of critical equipment, such as mechanical ventilators, especially in under resourced settings. In this article, we present a brief review of medical literature regarding established and readily available blueprints for ventilator systems. We also present our design relevant to under resourced areas called the ResQvent, which is a portable artificial manual breathing unit add-on device that can be automated to allow cyclical compression of the bag to provide adequate ventilation according to standard recommendations for infants, children and adults. Powered by 220-240 V electrical supply, this 18x8x8 inches, extremely portable device can prove to be a game changer in providing temporary automated ventilation at a reasonable cost. ResQvent has been successfully bench tested for accuracy on simulation software. With the continued motivation arising from the pandemic, we assume similar projects will attract attention; however, efforts are still required to design policies and arrange dependable financial resources for the creation and evaluation of open-source ventilators.Copyright © 2023 The Emergency Physicians Association of Turkey / Eurasian Journal of Emergency Medicine published by Galenos Publishing House.

   journal = {Psychiatry Research},
   volume = {295},
   pages = {113577},
   abstract = {The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new global health threat. By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse and economic fallout, COVID-19 has led to increase in risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma and stress, which eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. There is limited data on association of pandemics and suicides. Cases of suicides have been rising since COVID-19 first emerged in China. The association between suicides and pandemics can possibly be explained through various models like Durkheim's theory, Joiner's interpersonal theory, social stress theory, biological theories, etc. The frontline workers, elderly, migrants, homeless, socio-economically impoverished classes as well as those with pre-existing mental disorders, substance abuse and family history of suicides are at higher risk. Suicides are preventable and need early detection, awareness and socio-culturally tailored interventions. This narrative review draws global perspectives on the association of suicidality and pandemics, the theories and risk factors related to same based on the available evidence. It also hypothesizes neuroimmunity and immune based risk factors as possible links between the psychosocial vulnerabilities and suicide during outbreaks like COVID-19. Proposed strategies of suicide-prevention, as an integral part of public health response to the pandemic are subsequently discussed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Background: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining popularity as effective tools for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) research. These strategies can be used in diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and public health management. Bibliometric analysis quantifies the quality and impact of scholarly publications. ML in COVID-19 research is the focus of this bibliometric analysis. Method(s): A comprehensive literature study found ML-based COVID-19 research. Web of Science (WoS) was used for the study. The searches included "machine learning," "artificial intelligence," and COVID-19. To find all relevant studies, 2 reviewers searched independently. The network visualization was analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.19. Result(s): In the WoS Core, the average citation count was 13.6 +/- 41.3. The main research areas were computer science, engineering, and science and technology. According to document count, Tao Huang wrote 14 studies, Fadi Al-Turjman wrote 11, and Imran Ashraf wrote 11. The US, China, and India produced the most studies and citations. The most prolific research institutions were Harvard Medical School, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and King Abdulaziz University. In contrast, Nankai University, Oxford, and Imperial College London were the most mentioned organizations, reflecting their significant research contributions. First, "Covid-19" appeared 1983 times, followed by "machine learning" and "deep learning." The US Department of Health and Human Services funded this topic most heavily. Huang Tao, Feng Kaiyan, and Ashraf Imran pioneered bibliographic coupling. Conclusion(s): This study provides useful insights for academics and clinicians studying COVID-19 using ML. Through bibliometric data analysis, scholars can learn about highly recognized and productive authors and countries, as well as the publications with the most citations and keywords. New data and methodologies from the pandemic are expected to advance ML and AI modeling. It is crucial to recognize that these studies will pioneer this subject.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous losses in terms of human lives and economy in United States. The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Background The coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is now a global concern because of its higher transmission capacity and associated adverse consequences including death. The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. Methods A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). Results Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. Conclusion The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.Copyright: © 2020 Billah et al.

   abstract = {Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant strain on many health systems and economies. Mitigation policies decreased health impacts but had major macroeconomic impact. This article reviews models combining epidemiological and macroeconomic projections to enable policy makers to consider both macroeconomic and health objectives. Method(s): A scoping review of epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 was conducted, covering preprints, working articles, and journal publications. We assessed model methodologies, scope, and application to empirical data. Result(s): We found 80 articles modeling both the epidemiological and macroeconomic outcomes of COVID-19. Model scope is often limited to the impact of lockdown on health and total gross domestic product or aggregate consumption and to high-income countries. Just 14% of models assess disparities or poverty. Most models fall under 4 categories: compartmental-utility-maximization models, epidemiological models with stylized macroeconomic projections, epidemiological models linked to computable general equilibrium or input-output models, and epidemiological-economic agent-based models. We propose a taxonomy comparing these approaches to guide future model development. Conclusion(s): The epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 identified have varying complexity and meet different modeling needs. Priorities for future modeling include increasing developing country applications, assessing disparities and poverty, and estimating of long-run impacts. This may require better integration between epidemiologists and economists.Copyright © 2023},

   title = {Building resource constraints and feasibility considerations in mathematical models for infectious disease: A systematic literature review},
   journal = {Epidemics},
   volume = {35},
   pages = {100450},
   abstract = {Priority setting for infectious disease control is increasingly concerned with physical input constraints and other real-world restrictions on implementation and on the decision process. These health system constraints determine the 'feasibility' of interventions and hence impact. However, considering them within mathematical models places additional demands on model structure and relies on data availability. This review aims to provide an overview of published methods for considering constraints in mathematical models of infectious disease. We systematically searched the literature to identify studies employing dynamic transmission models to assess interventions in any infectious disease and geographical area that included non-financial constraints to implementation. Information was extracted on the types of constraints considered and how these were identified and characterised, as well as on the model structures and techniques for incorporating the constraints. A total of 36 studies were retained for analysis. While most dynamic transmission models identified were deterministic compartmental models, stochastic models and agent-based simulations were also successfully used for assessing the effects of non-financial constraints on priority setting. Studies aimed to assess reductions in intervention coverage (and programme costs) as a result of constraints preventing successful roll-out and scale-up, and/or to calculate costs and resources needed to relax these constraints and achieve desired coverage levels. We identified three approaches for incorporating constraints within the analyses: (i) estimation within the disease transmission model; (ii) linking disease transmission and health system models; (iii) optimising under constraints (other than the budget). The review highlighted the viability of expanding model-based priority setting to consider health system constraints. We show strengths and limitations in current approaches to identify and quantify locally-relevant constraints, ranging from simple assumptions to structured elicitation and operational models. Overall, there is a clear need for transparency in the way feasibility is defined as a decision criteria for its systematic operationalisation within models.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Background: This scoping review aims to identify and critically review quarantine preparedness in New Zealand and Australia pre-COVID-19 by categorising, comparing, and evaluating quarantine information contained within pandemic plans and exercises from both countries. Method(s): Parliamentary websites, including Archives New Zealand, ParlInfo and Google Scholar, were searched for publicly available plans and exercise reports from 2002 to 2019. Data were extracted from documents meeting the inclusion criteria and analysed using directive content analysis based on the Australian Disaster Preparedness Framework categories. This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews, which guided the data extraction, analysis, and presentation of results. Result(s): A total of 16 documents mentioned quarantine and were included in this scoping review. The emphasis and level of detail regarding quarantine characteristics and capabilities varied between New Zealand's five documents (one plan and four exercise reports) and Australia's 11 documents (one Influenza pandemic plan, eight state plans and two exercise reports). New Zealand's plan forecasted the need for both voluntary quarantine at home and involuntary quarantine in facilities for incoming travellers, whilst the Australian Influenza pandemic plan and state plans primarily considered voluntary quarantine within private residences. Capability gaps identified during exercises were not consistently incorporated into revised plans. Some government documents containing information on quarantine may not be publicly available, limiting the available evidence for this review. Conclusion(s): This scoping review highlights the need to incorporate a range of possible quarantine options into plans and preparation activities to test and identify gaps in government and responsible agencies' capabilities. Pandemic preparedness will be strengthened by incorporating quarantine scale and duration variables into exercise scenarios.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)},

The present systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. The main objective was to present critical information on the relationship between the family and the school in the face of the imposed distance learning scenario caused by COVID-19. A total of 25 articles dealing with the relationships established during the pandemic of any of the three agents involved (family, students, and school) were analysed. The results showed that the relationships between the three groups involved must be improved to some extent to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of distance learning. In conclusion, the educational scenario during the pandemic has been one of the most significant challenges experienced in the recent history of education.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

We collected 98 studies containing data of the SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in aquatic matrices around the world, of which 40% were from developing countries. Alongside a significant number of people infected by the virus, developing countries face socioeconomic deficiencies and insufficient public investment in infrastructure. Therefore, our study focused on highlighting solutions to provide sanitation in developing countries, considering the virus control in waters by disinfection techniques and sanitary measures, including alternatives for the vulnerable communities.

   abstract = {AIM: Reflect upon the visibility of nursing-led research during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection has galvanized collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts in clinical and research practice worldwide. The scarce evidence-base to manage patients with COVID-19 has included limited nurse-led research. INTRODUCTION: Clinical research nurses have greatly contributed to the delivery of COVID-19 research, yet the number of COVID-19 nursing-led research papers appears to be limited, with even fewer nurse-led research projects funded. METHOD(S): Authors' views and PubMed search on 'COVID-19 and nursing'. FINDINGS: There is a dearth of nursing-led research. Most papers describe the nursing contribution to COVID-19 care, changes in nursing working arrangements and emotional burden. There are opportunities to explore the consequences to vulnerable population groups of public health measures implemented to stop the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Workforce gaps, limited integration in research structures and clinical redeployment may have hampered nurse-led research. COVID-19 may exacerbate staffing deficits by disrupting the education pipeline, obstructing the transition from clinical to academic practice, particularly in areas where clinical academic roles are yet to emerge. CONCLUSION(S): The absence of nurse-led research in COVID-19 can be explained by chronic, underlying factors and the features of the pandemic response. Emerging models of care, effective staffing and inequalities related to COVID-19 appear obvious research areas. Nursing leadership needs to strengthen its political voice and lobbying skills to secure nurse-led research funding. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY: Embracing international nursing research, strengthening collaborations and lobbying policymakers for investment in nurse-sensitive research would enhance the response to COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the world, testing each nation's ability to understand the state of the pandemic in their country and control it. As we looked into the epidemiological data to uncover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discovered that critical metadata is missing which is meant to give context to epidemiological parameters. In this review, we identify key metadata for the COVID-19 fatality rate after a thorough analysis of mathematical models, serology-informed studies and determinants of causes of death for the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we find reasons to establish a set of standard-based guidelines to record and report the data from epidemiological studies. Additionally, we discuss why standardizing nomenclature is be a necessary component of these guidelines to improve communication and reproducibility. The goal of establishing these guidelines is to facilitate the interpretation of COVID-19 epidemiological findings and data by the general public, health officials, policymakers and fellow researchers. Our suggestions may not address all aspects of this issue; rather, they are meant to be the foundation for which experts can establish and encourage future guidelines throughout the appropriate communities.

The novel coronavirus termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization has posed a huge threat to human safety and social development. This mini review aimed to summarize the online education mode and plans for schools to resume full-time campus study in China during COVID-19. Chinese schools have made significant contributions to the prevention and control of the transmission of COVID-19 by adopting online learning from home. However, normal opening and classroom teaching have been affected. For education systems at all levels, online education may be an effective way to make up for the lack of classroom teaching during the epidemic. To protect staff and students from COVID-19, the timing of students returning to full-time campus study needs to be considered carefully. Reviewing and summarizing of the Chinese education system's response to the virus would be of great value not only in developing educational policy but also in guiding other countries to formulate educational countermeasures.Copyright © 2020 Cen, Sun, Rong, Fekete, Baker, Song and Gu.},

   abstract = {Background: When health systems worldwide grapple with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, its effect on the global environment is also a significant consideration factor. It is a two-way process where the pre-COVID climate factors influenced the landscape in which the disease proliferates globally and the consequences of the pandemic on our surroundings. The environmental health disparities will also have a long-lasting effect on public health response., Main body: The ongoing research on the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 must also include the role of environmental factors in the process of infection and the differential severity of the disease. Studies have shown that the virus has created positive and negative ramifications on the world environment, especially in countries most critically affected by the pandemic. Contingency measures to slow down the virus, such as self-distancing and lockdowns have shown improvements in air, water, and noise quality with a concomitant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, biohazard waste management is a cause for concern that can result in negative effects on planetary health. At the peak of the infection, most attention has been diverted to the medical aspects of the pandemic. Gradually, policymakers must shift their focus to social and economic avenues, environmental development, and sustainability., Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the environment, both directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the sudden halt in economic and industrial activities led to a decrease in air and water pollution, as well as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the increased use of single-use plastics and a surge in e-commerce activities have had negative effects on the environment. As we move forward, we must consider the pandemic's long-term impacts on the environment and work toward a more sustainable future that balances economic growth and environmental protection. The study shall update the readers on the various facets of the interaction between this pandemic and environmental health with model development for long-term sustainability., Graphic Abstract: Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.},

   abstract = {Distancing is one of the barrier measures in mitigating epidemics. We aimed to investigate the typology, effectiveness, and side effects of distancing rules during epidemics. Electronic searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed in April 2020, using Mesh-Terms representing various forms of distancing ('social isolation', 'social distancing', 'quarantine') combining with 'epidemics'. PRISMA-ScR statement was consulted to report this review. A total of 314 titles were identified and 93 were finally included. 2009 influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics were the most studied. Distancing measures were mostly classified as case-based and community-based interventions. The combination of distancing rules, like school closure, home working, isolation and quarantine, has proven to be effective in reducing R0 and flattening the epidemic curve, also when initiated early at a high rate and combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions. Epidemiological and modeling studies showed that Isolation and quarantine in the 2009 Influenza pandemic were effective measures to decrease attack rate also with high level of compliance but there was an increased risk of household transmission. lockdown was also effective to reduce R0 from 2.6 to 0.6 and to increase doubling time from 2 to 4 days in the covid-19 pandemic. The evidence for school closure and workplace distancing was moderate as single intervention. Psychological disorder, unhealthy behaviors, disruption of economic activities, social discrimination, and stigmatization were the main side effects of distancing measures. Earlier implementation of combined distancing measures leads to greater effectiveness in containing outbreaks. Their indication must be relevant and based on evidence to avoid adverse effects on the community. These results would help decision-makers to develop response plans based on the required experience and strengthen the capacity of countries to fight against future epidemics.

Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP)-the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language-can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges.},

In this paper, we have focused on reviewing the results of epidemiological modelling especially the fractional epidemic model and summarized different types of fractional epidemic models including fractional Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) models and so on. Furthermore, we propose a general fractional SEIAR model in the case of single-term and multi-term fractional differential equations. A feasible and reliable parameter estimation method based on modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimisation is also presented to fit the real data using fractional SEIAR model. The effective methods to solve the fractional epidemic models we introduced construct a simple and effective analytical technique that can be easily extended and applied to other fractional models, and can help guide the concerned bodies in preventing or controlling, even predicting the infectious disease outbreaks.

   abstract = {Context: A considerable amount of evidence exists on the epidemiological features as well as on the mortality trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, much less is known about the health-economics burden. Objective(s): To summarize the currently existing evidence and to identify evidence gaps on the quantification of the multifactorial burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We retrieved all the articles published in English from January 1st to June 30th 2020, indexed in MEDLINE, that matched a series of combined-keyword queries. Manual curation was used to classify articles either as relevant or non-relevant to the subject. Result(s): 61 positive hits were identified. Out of those, 22 articles were deemed to be relevant. Most of the articles provided evidence on high-income countries (USA, KR, ITA, CN) and barely no evidence is available for middle and low-income countries. No COVID-19 specific data exists to quantify direct medical costs, nor to estimate COVID-19 specific utility and disability weights. Some authors have reported estimates based on health-economics extrapolations made from other respiratory tract infections, which they then apply to different hypothetical COVID-19 epidemiological scenarios. Several authors have published work on the macro-economic consequences of the pandemic. Other burden dimensions that have been explored are the impact on mental health, the increase of domestic violence because of the lockdown, and the generalized loss of confidence that might lead to a stock market crisis. Conclusion(s): Multiple evidence gaps remain to be filled on the health-economics burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the short-term, filling those gaps would be important for the decision-making process to tackle the pandemic. In the long-term, it could facilitate the definition of pandemic-preparedness policies around the world.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {Background: Visual analytics (VA) promotes the understanding of data with visual, interactive techniques, using analytic and visual engines. The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. Objective(s): This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). Method(s): Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. Result(s): After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. Conclusion(s): With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

   journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
   volume = {878},

   abstract = {On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose causative agent is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. This virus is predominantly transmitted via respiratory droplets and shed via sputum, saliva, urine, and stool. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been able to monitor the circulation of viral pathogens in the population. This tool demands both in-lab and computational work to be meaningful for, among other purposes, the prediction of outbreaks. In this context, we present a systematic review that organizes and discusses laboratory procedures for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification from a wastewater matrix, along with modeling techniques applied to the development of WBE for COVID-19 surveillance. The goal of this review is to present the current panorama of WBE operational aspects as well as to identify current challenges related to it. Our review was conducted in a reproducible manner by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews. We identified a lack of standardization in wastewater analytical procedures. Regardless, the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach was the most reported technique employed to detect and quantify viral RNA in wastewater samples. As a more convenient sample matrix, we suggest the solid portion of wastewater to be considered in future investigations due to its higher viral load compared to the liquid fraction. Regarding the epidemiological modeling, the data-driven approach was consistently used for the prediction of variables associated with outbreaks. Future efforts should also be directed toward the development of rapid, more economical, portable, and accurate detection devices.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This study identifies the influencing factors of community epidemic resilience through systematic literature review under the 4R framework, then obtains the relationships of influencing factors through Interpretive structural model, and finally assesses the performance of epidemic resilience using PROMETHEE II method through empirical cases in Nanjing, China. The results show that: (1) Eight factors influencing the epidemic resilience of community are identified, and the economic level plays the root role; (2) Community epidemic resilience can be improved from robustness, rapidity, redundancy and resourcefulness aspects; (3) Through the empirical analysis, the epidemic resilience ranking of community can be displayed (Community D > T > S > F); (4) Additionally, the performance and sensitivity analysis of influencing factors in each community can be demonstrated. (5) Finally, four implications are proposed, namely, allocating public resources rationally, significantly increasing the economic level, ensuring the accuracy of information delivery and conducting disaster learning.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {In an attempt to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have implemented various social restrictions, such as closing schools and asking people to work from home. Nevertheless, after months of strict quarantine, a reopening of society is required. Many countries are planning exit strategies to progressively lift the lockdown without leading to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Identifying exit strategies for a safe reopening of schools and places of work is critical in informing decision-makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. This scoping review describes multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing, and contact tracing. It highlights how each strategy needs to be based on both the epidemiological situation and contextualize at local circumstances to anticipate the possibility of COVID-19 resurgence. However, the retrieved evidence lacks operational solutions and are mainly based on mathematical models and derived from grey literature. There is a need to report the impact of the implementation of country-tailored strategies and assess their effectiveness through high-quality experimental studies.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
   volume = {778},
   pages = {146220},
   abstract = {Healthcare waste comprises the waste generated by healthcare facilities, medical laboratories and biomedical research facilities. Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes. This review discusses the different healthcare solid waste management strategies practiced in different countries, the challenges faced during this management, and the possible solutions for overcoming these challenges. It also provides useful insights into healthcare solid waste management scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic and a possible way forward.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has focussed attention on models of healthcare that avoid face-to-face contacts between clinicians and patients, and teleconsultations have become the preferred mode of primary care delivery. However, the effectiveness of remote consultations in this setting remains unclear. Objective(s): To evaluate the impact of telephone or video consultations compared to those conducted face-to-face on key patient-relevant outcomes and healthcare utilisation in primary care, mental health and allied health services, which have had a critical role in the management of the wider and longer-term consequences of COVID-19. Method(s): A systematic review of primary studies comparing telephone or video consultations versus face-to-face visits, following the PRISMA guidelines. Result(s): Overall, consultations delivered by telephone and videoconference were as effective as face-to-face in-person visits to improve clinical outcomes in adults with mental health conditions and those attending primary care services. Patient satisfaction with telephone and video consultations and the therapeutic alliance was high across the studies. However, high discontinuation rates in patients receiving teleconsultations indicate this may not be a suitable modality of healthcare delivery for all patients. Teleconsultations offer significant patient time savings in primary care, but appropriate implementation, including training of healthcare professionals and management of technical issues, is essential to ensure effective and valuable clinical interventions. Conclusion(s): Teleconsultations via telephone or videoconference are an effective alternative to face-to-face consultations for many patients attending primary care and mental health services. Teleconsultations have the potential to deliver time-efficient and lower-cost interventions at a distance while improving access to healthcare. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   journal = {Surgical Oncology},
   volume = {45},
   pages = {101859},
   abstract = {Background: To provide for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) healthcare capacity, (surgical oncology) guidelines were established, forcing to alter the timing of performing surgical procedures. It is essential to determine whether these guidelines have led to disease progression. This study aims to give an insight into the number of surgical oncology procedures performed during the pandemic and provide information on short-term clinical outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic literature search was performed on all COVID-19 articles including operated patients, published before March 21, 2022. Meta-analysis was performed to visualize the number of performed surgical oncology procedures during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Random effects models were used for evaluating short-term clinical outcomes. Result(s): Twenty-four studies containing 6762 patients who underwent a surgical oncology procedure during the pandemic were included. The number of performed surgical procedures for an oncological pathology decreased (-26.4%) during the pandemic. The number of performed surgical procedures for breast cancer remained stable (+0.3%). Moreover, no difference was identified in the number of >=T2 (OR 1.00, P = 0.989), >=T3 (OR 0.95, P = 0.778), >=N1 (OR 1.01, P = 0.964) and major postoperative complications (OR 1.55, P = 0.134) during the pandemic. Conclusion(s): The number of performed surgical oncology procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased. In addition, the number of performed surgical breast cancer procedures remained stable. Oncological staging and major postoperative complications showed no significant difference compared to pre-pandemic practice. During future pandemics, the performed surgical oncology practice during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic seems appropriate for short-term results.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {The Spatiotemporal Epidemiologic Modeler (STEM) is an open source software project supported by the Eclipse Foundation and used by a global community of researchers and public health officials working to track and, when possible, control outbreaks of infectious disease in human and animal populations. STEM is not a model or a tool designed for a specific disease; it is a flexible, modular framework supporting exchange and integration of community models, reusable plug-in components, and denominator data, available to researchers worldwide at www.eclipse.org/stem. A review of multiple projects illustrates its capabilities. STEM has been used to study variations in transmission of seasonal influenza in Israel by strains; evaluate social distancing measures taken to curb the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico City; study measles outbreaks in part of London and inform local policy on immunization; and gain insights into H7N9 avian influenza transmission in China. A multistrain dengue fever model explored the roles of the mosquito vector, cross-strain immunity, and antibody response in the frequency of dengue outbreaks. STEM has also been used to study the impact of variations in climate on malaria incidence. During the Ebola epidemic, a weekly conference call supported the global modeling community; subsequent work modeled the impact of behavioral change and tested disease reintroduction via animal reservoirs. Work in Germany tracked salmonella in pork from farm to fork; and a recent doctoral dissertation used the air travel feature to compare the potential threats posed by weaponizing infectious diseases. Current projects include work in Great Britain to evaluate control strategies for parasitic disease in sheep, and in Germany and Hungary, to validate the model and inform policy decisions for African swine fever. STEM Version 4.0.0, released in early 2019, includes tools used in these projects and updates technical aspects of the framework to ease its use and re-use.},

   journal = {PharmacoEconomics},
   volume = {39},
   number = {8},
   pages = {879-887},
   abstract = {COVID-19 in the UK has had a profound impact on population health and other socially important outcomes, including on education and the economy. Although a range of evidence has guided policy, epidemiological models have been central. It is less clear whether models to support decision making have sought to integrate COVID-19 epidemiology with a consideration of broader health, wellbeing and economic implications. We report on a rapid review of studies seeking to integrate epidemiological and economic modelling to assess the impacts of alternative policies. Overall, our results suggest that few studies have explored broader impacts of different COVID-19 policies in the UK. Three studies looked only at health, capturing impacts on individuals with and without COVID-19, with various methods used to model the latter. Four models considered health and wider impacts on individuals' economic outcomes, such as wages. However, these models made no attempt to consider the dynamic impacts on economic outcomes of others and the wider economy. The most complex analyses sought to link epidemiological and dynamic economic models. Studies compared a wide range of policies, although most were defined in general terms with minimal consideration of their granular specifications. There was minimal exploration of uncertainty, with no consideration in half the studies. Selecting appropriate models to inform decisions requires careful thought of factors relevant to the decision options under consideration such as the outcomes of interest, sectors likely to be impacted and causal pathways. In summary, better linking epidemiological and economic modelling would help to inform COVID-19 policy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {Background: Although the US government approved hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) for hospitalized coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients, some studies denied efficacy of HCQ and CQ. We aimed to evaluate HCQ/CQ treatment for COVID-19. Method(s): Five databases were searched on April 15, 2020, without publication date restriction. We followed both Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement reporting recommendations. A random-model meta-analysis was conducted to pool odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR). The quality of evidence for each outcome and the final recommendation was assessed using the GRADE guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. Result(s): We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational studies with 2,063 COVID-19 cases. All-cause mortality was not affected by the administration of HCQ/CQ [OR: 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-2.09, P=0.89]. No improvement of viral clearance was found neither by time-to-event analysis (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.74-1.94, P=0.47) nor frequency on day 7 (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.33- 6.63, P=0.62). HCQ/CQ treatment increased the risk of the any adverse event with OR of 3.56 (95% CI: 1.62-7.83, P=0.002). Conclusion(s): HCQ/CQ failed to decrease the all-cause mortality (very low quality evidence) and did not improve viral clearance (low or very low quality evidence) but increased the risk of any adverse event (moderate quality evidence). Routine administration of HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 patients is not recommended (weak recommendation, Grade 2C).Copyright © 2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease.},

   abstract = {Background: The global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) disease has highlighted the importance of disease monitoring, diagnosing, treating, and screening. Technology-based instruments could efficiently assist healthcare systems during pandemics by allowing rapid and widespread transfer of information, real-time tracking of data transfer, and virtualization of meetings and patient visits. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the applications of clinical informatics (CI) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A comprehensive search was performed on Medline and Scopus databases in September 2020. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The extracted data from the studies reviewed were about study sample, study type, objectives, clinical informatics domain, applied method, sample size, outcomes, findings, and conclusion. The risk of bias was evaluated in the studies using appropriate instruments based on the type of each study. The selected studies were then subjected to thematic synthesis. Result(s): In this review study, 72 out of 2716 retrieved articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text analysis. Most of the articles reviewed were done in China and the United States of America. The majority of the studies were conducted in the following CI domains: prediction models (60%), telehealth (36%), and mobile health (4%). Most of the studies in telehealth domain used synchronous methods, such as online and phone- or video-call consultations. Mobile applications were developed as self-triage, self-scheduling, and information delivery tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common types of prediction models among the reviewed studies were neural network (49%), classification (42%), and linear models (4.5%). Conclusion(s): The present study showed clinical informatics applications during COVID-19 and identified current gaps in this field. Health information technology and clinical informatics seem to be useful in assisting clinicians and managers to combat COVID-19. The most common domains in clinical informatics for research on the COVID-19 crisis were prediction models and telehealth. It is suggested that future researchers conduct scoping reviews to describe and analyze other levels of medical informatics, including bioinformatics, imaging informatics, and public health informatics.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   abstract = {Computational models for predicting the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic played a central role in policy-making at regional and national levels. We performed a systematic review, data synthesis, and secondary validation of studies that reported on prediction models addressing the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. A literature search in January 2021 based on the search triangle model identified 1672 peer-reviewed articles, preprints and reports. After applying inclusion criteria 52 studies remained out of which 12 passed a Risk of Bias Opinion Tool. When comparing model predictions with actual outcomes only 4 studies exhibited an acceptable forecast (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE<20%). Models that predicted disease incidence could not be assessed due to the lack of reliable data during 2020. Drawing conclusions about the accuracy of the models with acceptable methodological quality was challenging because some models were published before the time period for the prediction, while other models were published during the prediction period or even afterwards. We conclude that the forecasting models involving Sweden developed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had limited accuracy. The knowledge attained in this study can be used to improve the preparedness for coming pandemics.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments in several ways. Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers' psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this "psychological pandemic".Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

   journal = {Infectious Disease Modelling},
   volume = {6},
   pages = {258-272},
   abstract = {Since the emergence of the novel 2019 coronavirus pandemic in December 2019 (COVID-19), numerous modellers have used diverse techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st, 2020 to November 30th, 2020. We further examined the accuracy and precision of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths as well as uncertainties of these predictions. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (78.93%) and European (59.09%) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8%) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7%), Bayesian approach (4.7%), Network models (2.3%) and Agent-based models (1.3%). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rho = - 0.56, p = 0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient safety is a public health problem worldwide. In situ simulation (ISS) arises as a learning strategy that allows health professionals to immerse themselves in a real environment without endangering the patients until they have learned the skills needed, thus increasing the quality of care. This systematic review aimed to verify the efficacy of the use of "in situ simulation" as a method that will allow health professionals to increase patient safety in Intensive Care Units after the situation experienced during the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus., METHODS: Seven studies were reviewed using the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews. The CASPe guide was used to assess the quality of the manuscripts., RESULTS: The main topics that emerged from this review in relation to in situ simulation were as follows: looking at aspects such as patient self-perception of safety, adverse events, interprofessional communication and health system organization in relation to in situ simulation., CONCLUSIONS: The adequate implementation of in situ simulation after the COVID-19 pandemic in ICU services is shown to be an efficient and effective strategy to promote improvement in the attitudes on a culture of safety and teamwork of professionals.},

   abstract = {The serial interval is the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair. The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: Conduct a review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID-19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters., METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of the literature covering the period 1 January 2020 and 21 August 2020, following predefined eligibility criteria. Forty scientific papers met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review., RESULTS: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.03 to 7.6 days, based on 38 estimates, and the median from 1.0 to 6.0 days (based on 15 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.95 to 5.20 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time., DISCUSSION: Estimates of the serial interval and the generation time are very dependent on the specific factors that apply at the time that the data are collected, including the level of social contact. Consequently, the estimates may not be entirely relevant to other environments. Therefore, local estimates should be obtained as soon as possible. Careful consideration should be given to the methodology that is used. Real-time estimations of the serial interval/generation time, allowing for variations over time, may provide more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval/generation time distributions.

   abstract = {Introduction and hypothesis: The COVID-19 pandemic and the desire to "flatten the curve" of transmission have significantly affected the way providers care for patients. Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) must provide high quality of care through remote access such as telemedicine. No clear guidelines exist on the use of telemedicine in FPMRS. Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic. Method(s): We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms. We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines. We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments. Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission. Conclusion(s): We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.Copyright © 2020, The International Urogynecological Association.},

   abstract = {The outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of international concern. A number of studies have used modeling techniques and developed dynamic models to estimate the epidemiological parameters, explore and project the trends of the COVID-19, and assess the effects of intervention or control measures. We identified 63 studies and summarized the three aspects of these studies: epidemiological parameters estimation, trend prediction, and control measure evaluation. Despite the discrepancy between the predictions and the actuals, the dynamic model has made great contributions in the above three aspects. The most important role of dynamic models is exploring possibilities rather than making strong predictions about longer-term disease dynamics.Copyright © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

   abstract = {Objective: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the public health responses were associated with a huge health burden, which could influence sleep quality. This meta-analysis and systematic review examined the prevalence of poor sleep quality in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO were systematically searched from their respective inception to October 27, 2022. Prevalence rates of poor sleep were analyzed using a random effects model. Result(s): Totally, 24 epidemiological and 12 comparative studies with 8,146 COVID-19 patients and 5,787 healthy controls were included. The pooled prevalence of poor sleep quality based on the included studies was 65.0% (95%CI: 59.56-70.44%, I2 = 97.6%). COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of poor sleep quality compared to healthy controls (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.30-2.30, p < 0.01, I2 = 78.1%) based on the 12 comparative studies. Subgroup analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients in low-income countries (p = 0.011) and in studies using a lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score cut-off (p < 0.001) were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Meta-regression analyses revealed that being female (p = 0.044), older (p < 0.001) and married (p = 0.009) were significantly correlated with a higher risk of poor sleep quality while quality score (p = 0.014) were negatively correlated with the prevalence of poor sleep quality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion(s): Poor sleep quality was found to be very common in COVID-19 patients. Considering the negative effects of poor sleep quality on daily life, sleep quality should be routinely assessed and appropriately addressed in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2024 Gui, Wang, Li, Li, Su, Cheung, Lok, Ungvari, Ng, Zhang and Xiang.},

   number = {12},
   abstract = {Objective The aim of this review, conducted in April 2020, is to examine available national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 and to explore the ways in which these guidelines support primary care facilities in responding to the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Rapid review and narrative synthesis. Data sources PubMed, Embase and Google, as well as the websites of relevant national health departments, were searched from 1 January 2020 to 24 April 2020. Eligibility criteria Documents included must be issued by a national health authority, must be specific to COVID-19 care, directed at healthcare workers or managers, and must refer to the role of primary care in the COVID-19 response. Results We identified 17 documents from 14 countries. An adapted framework on primary care challenges and responses to pandemic influenza framed our analysis. Guidelines generally reported on COVID-19 service delivery and mostly made specific recommendations for ensuring continued delivery of essential primary care services through telehealth or other virtual care modalities. Few offered guidance to support surveillance as a public health function. All offered guidance on implementing outbreak control measures, largely through flexible and coordinated organisational models with partners from various sectors. There was a lack of guidance to support supply chain management and practice resilience in primary care, and lack of personal protective equipment represents a serious threat to the provision of quality care during the pandemic. Conclusions Current national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 provide guidance on infection control and minimising the risk of spread in primary care practices, while supporting the use of new technology and coordinated partnerships. However, to ensure primary care practice resilience and quality of care are upheld, guidelines must offer recommendations on supply chain management and operational continuity, supported by adequate resources.Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

This paper has two objectives: 1) to provide a conceptual review of research that applies the bioecological model to youth substance use prevention with a focus on the concepts of time and physical space use and 2) to describe a case study that examines the implementation of the IPM in Canada within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Study data were collected through semi-structured qualitative interviews with key stakeholders involved in implementing the IPM. RESULT(S): Findings are organized within three over-arching themes derived from a thematic analysis: 1) Issues that influence time and space use patterns and youth substance use, 2) Family and community cohesion and influences on developmental context and time use and 3) Opportunities presented by the pandemic that can promote youth wellbeing. CONCLUSION(S): We apply the findings to research on the IPM as well as the pandemic to examine opportunities that may support primary prevention and overall youth wellbeing. We use the concepts of time and space as a foundation to discuss implications for policy and practice going forward.},

   volume = {86},
   pages = {332-346},
   abstract = {In this study, I constitute a search based COVID-19 sentiment index using Google search volume. I develop an alternative Scared COVID-19 Attitude Revealed by Eager Search (SCARES) index using the household search volume i.e. "coronavirus pandemic", "coronavirus epidemic", and "coronavirus outbreak" of United States (US) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using daily data from May 1, 2020 to July 30, 2021, I find that SCARES index negatively explains stock market return and subsequent return reversals, implying that households' increased pandemic sentiment negatively affects equity market return. Furthermore, decile regressions on characteristics-sorted portfolio returns show that SCARES index predicts the return reversals of firms that are small, less profitable, and with low investment. I also report that COVID-19 search shocks of households do not significantly predict any of the Fama-French five-factors except SMB (small-minus-big). Moreover, I use two state Markov switching model and find that structural breaks associated with pandemic phases make SCARES positively related to indices i.e. twitter based uncertainty, volatility index, economic policy uncertainty, and business condition in high volatility regime. Finally, sub-period analysis reports that, in stock market context, people start to react slowly and become relatively less responsive to the COVID-19 search keywords. The findings of this paper can assist key stakeholders in the market to carefully analyze the asset return pattern during pandemic regimes.

   pages = {35-83},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global crisis of our lifetimes, and leadership has been critical to societies' capacity to deal with it. Here effective leadership has brought people together, provided a clear perspective on what is happening and what response is needed, and mobilized the population to act in the most effective ways to bring the pandemic under control. Informed by a model of identity leadership (Haslam, Reicher & Platow, 2020), this review argues that leaders' ability to do these things is grounded in their ability to represent and advance the shared interests of group members and to create and embed a sense of shared social identity among them (a sense of "us-ness"). For leaders, then, this sense of us-ness is the key resource that they need to marshal in order to harness the support and energy of citizens. The review discusses examples of the successes and failures of different leaders during the pandemic and organizes these around five policy priorities related to the 5Rs of identity leadership: readying, reflecting, representing, realizing, and reinforcing. These priorities and associated lessons are relevant not only to the management of COVID-19 but to crisis management and leadership more generally.

   abstract = {While the world continues to grapple with the devastating effects of the SARS-nCoV-2 virus, different scientific groups, including researchers from different parts of the world, are trying to collaborate to discover solutions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus permanently. Henceforth, the current study envisions the analysis of predictive models that employ machine learning techniques and mathematical modeling to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, wherein a search into different databases, viz., PubMed and IEEE Explore, fetched 1178 records initially. From an initial of 1178 records, only 50 articles were analyzed completely. Around (64%) of the studies employed data-driven mathematical models, whereas only (26%) used machine learning models. Hybrid and ARIMA models constituted about (5%) and (3%) of the selected articles. Various Quality Evaluation Metrics (QEM), including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, Brier-score, F1-score, RMSE, AUC, and prediction and validation cohort, were used to gauge the effectiveness of the studied models. The study also considered the impact of Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), AstraZeneca (ChAd0x1), and Moderna (mRNA-1273) on Beta (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) viral variants and the impact of administering booster doses given the evolution of viral variants of the virus.

   abstract = {Background: Telepalliative care is increasingly used in palliative care, but has yet to be examined from a patient and family perspective. A synthesis of evidence may provide knowledge on how to plan and provide telepalliative care that caters specifically to patients and families' needs. Objective(s): To synthesise evidence on patients and families' perspectives on telepalliative care. Design(s): A systematic integrative review (PROSPERO #CRD42022301206) reported in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Inclusion criteria; primary peer-reviewed studies published 2011-2022, patient and family perspective, >18 years, telepalliative care and English/Danish language. Quality was appraised using the mixed-methods appraisal tool, version 2020. Guided by Toronto and Remington, data were extracted, thematically analysed and synthesised. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched in March 2022 and updated in February 2023. Result(s): Forty-four studies were included. Analysis revealed five themes; the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on telepalliative care, adding value for patients and families, synchronous and asynchronous telepalliative care, the integration of telepalliative care with other services and the tailoring and timing of telepalliative care. Conclusion(s): Enhanced access to care and convenience, as attributes of telepalliative care, are highly valued. Patients and families have varying needs during the illness trajectory that may be addressed by early integration of telepalliative care based on models of care that are flexible and combine synchronous and asynchronous solutions. Further research should examine telepalliative care in a post-pandemic context, use of models of care and identify meaningful outcome measures from patient and family perspectives for evaluation of telepalliative care.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.},

   number = {5},
   pages = {e1007893},
   abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation- based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter- search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy- either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.Copyright © 2020 Hazelbag et al.},

   abstract = {Background: To systematically review and summarize the available literature regarding the women's sexual function during COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to pre-pandemic period. Method(s): We searched PubMed and Embase from the inception of the databases until 15th April 2021. Data regarding the sexual function, measured by female sexual function index (FSFI), of adult sexually active women were extracted from the eligible studies and compared between the before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcome was the frequency of intercourse during pandemic time. The random-effect model was used to pool the mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 value. Result(s): Our search resulted in a sample of six eligible studies, which involved 1114 female participants. The total FSFI score among study participants during pandemic was 22.93 (95% CI: 19.26-26.59), which indicated a significant decrease in sexual function of women during pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic time (mean difference = -3.80, 95% CI: -6.48 to -1.12, p = 0.005, I2 = 96%). We also conducted a meta-analysis of individual FSFI domains. During pandemic, women had problems with arousal (p < 0.0001), orgasm (p = 0.0008), satisfaction (p = 0.0009), and pain (p = 0.009). No significant difference in frequency of intercourse was observed between pre- and during pandemic (p = 0.80). Furthermore, no significant publication bias was present among included studies. Conclusion(s): Overall, there was a significant decrease in sexual function of sexually active adult women during COVID-19 pandemic. The most affected areas of sexual function were arousal, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. Physicians must be aware of COVID-19 impact on sexual life of women and provide proper counseling.Copyright © 2022 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.},

   abstract = {Background: The journal impact factor significantly influences research publishing and funding decisions. With the surge in research due to COVID-19, this study investigates whether references remain reliable citation predictors during this period. Method(s): Four multidisciplinary journals (PLoS One, Medicine [Baltimore], J. Formos. Med. Assoc., and Eur. J. Med. Res.) were analyzed using the Web of Science database for 2020 to 2022 publications. The study employed descriptive, predictive, and diagnostic analytics, with tools such as 4-quadrant radar plots, univariate regressions, and country-based collaborative maps via the follower-leading cluster algorithm. Result(s): Six countries dominated the top 20 affiliations: China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and Brazil. References remained strong citation indicators during the COVID-19 period, except for Eur. J. Med. Res. due to its smaller sample size (n = 492) than other counterparts (i.e., 41,181, 12,793, and 1464). Three journals showed higher network density coefficients, suggesting a potential foundation for reference-based citation predictions. Conclusion(s): Despite variations among journals, references effectively predict article citations during the COVID-19 era, underlining the importance of network density. Future studies should delve deeper into the correlation between network density and citation prediction.Copyright © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran},
   volume = {37},
   pages = {137},
   abstract = {Background: Scenarios are the most efficient methods to explore our uncertainty about the future. Even with increasing utilization, the majority of scenarios still fall short of meeting the future "uncertainties" in health. This article examines one of the most sensitive encounters of the health system with uncertainties-COVID-19 pandemic-and the type of uncertainty analysis in health scenarios to discuss the importance and determine the existing gaps while providing a better mechanism for scenario planning in the health system., Methods: To examine the extent, range, and nature of scenario research, a preliminary mapping of the existing literature, summarizing research findings, and identifying research gaps, we have taken help from the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) model and to improve the quality of the results, we have also used the PRISMA framework. To identify the studies relevant to the issue, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched for peer-reviewed published articles. All peer reviewed articles from January 01, 2020, to December 31, 2020, were included in this review. The search strategy was mainly the systematic use of English keywords such as "coronavirus," "covid-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "2019-ncov," and scenario. To improve the search sensitivity, subject searching based on MeSh and Emtree keywords was used., Results: It is crucial to identify the health domains where the scenarios can be used. The major ideas that were covered and their variations would also be identified using these different scenarios. Based on the selected articles, we can answer some critical questions. First, in which health fields is the scenario method used? Second, what are the key concepts in these studies, and third, what is the difference between them? Policy, epidemiology, and economics use futures studies scenarios more than other social science disciplines in health. Furthermore, we have looked at the fact that selecting the appropriate kind, utilizing new methodologies, and emphasizing uncertainty analysis are the core difficulties associated with health case scenarios., Conclusion: Based on examining the existing indicators in the health scenarios, establishing the "uncertainty analysis" as the basis can improve scenario planning in this field. Also, if scenario planning is done as a process based on uncertainty analysis, it is more accurate and helps make better decisions in the field of health.

   abstract = {Purpose of review The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a drastic change in healthcare priorities, availability of resources and accommodation of different needs and scenarios. We sought to review the effect of the pandemic on different aspects of nephrolithiasis. Recent findings The pandemic resulted in a significant impact on management of patients with nephrolithiasis around the world. A significant decrease in patient presentation and differences in strategies of management to truncate exposure and surgery time and expedite patient discharge deferring definitive management has been noted. Moreover, new safety measures such as COVID-19 PCR testing prior to surgery and limiting any intervention for COVID-19 positive patients to only life-saving scenarios has been implemented. Different emergency triaging proposals are being used, mainly including high risk patients with septic shock or complete obstruction/renal injury. Moreover, the emergence of telehealth has changed outpatient practice dramatically with a significant adoption to minimize exposure. Lastly, the effect of COVID-19 on renal physiology has been described with significant potential to cause morbidity from immediate or delayed acute kidney. No physiological effect on stone formation has yet been described, and transmission through urine is rare. Summary The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly shifted the treatment of nephrolithiasis in many ways, including emergency triage, outpatient care, and definitive management. Although various approaches and algorithms proposed are meant to optimize management in the time of the pandemic, further studies are required for validation.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

   journal = {JMIR mHealth and uHealth},
   volume = {10},

   pages = {e34384},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wearable devices hold great promise, particularly for data generation for cutting-edge health research, and their demand has risen substantially in recent years. However, there is a shortage of aggregated insights into how wearables have been used in health research. OBJECTIVE(S): In this review, we aim to broadly overview and categorize the current research conducted with affordable wearable devices for health research. METHOD(S): We performed a scoping review to understand the use of affordable, consumer-grade wearables for health research from a population health perspective using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. A total of 7499 articles were found in 4 medical databases (PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL). Studies were eligible if they used noninvasive wearables: worn on the wrist, arm, hip, and chest; measured vital signs; and analyzed the collected data quantitatively. We excluded studies that did not use wearables for outcome assessment and prototype studies, devices that cost >500 (US $570), or obtrusive smart clothing. RESULT(S): We included 179 studies using 189 wearable devices covering 10,835,733 participants. Most studies were observational (128/179, 71.5%), conducted in 2020 (56/179, 31.3%) and in North America (94/179, 52.5%), and 93% (10,104,217/10,835,733) of the participants were part of global health studies. The most popular wearables were fitness trackers (86/189, 45.5%) and accelerometer wearables, which primarily measure movement (49/189, 25.9%). Typical measurements included steps (95/179, 53.1%), heart rate (HR; 55/179, 30.7%), and sleep duration (51/179, 28.5%). Other devices measured blood pressure (3/179, 1.7%), skin temperature (3/179, 1.7%), oximetry (3/179, 1.7%), or respiratory rate (2/179, 1.1%). The wearables were mostly worn on the wrist (138/189, 73%) and cost <200 (US $228; 120/189, 63.5%). The aims and approaches of all 179 studies revealed six prominent uses for wearables, comprising correlations-wearable and other physiological data (40/179, 22.3%), method evaluations (with subgroups; 40/179, 22.3%), population-based research (31/179, 17.3%), experimental outcome assessment (30/179, 16.8%), prognostic forecasting (28/179, 15.6%), and explorative analysis of big data sets (10/179, 5.6%). The most frequent strengths of affordable wearables were validation, accuracy, and clinical certification (104/179, 58.1%). CONCLUSION(S): Wearables showed an increasingly diverse field of application such as COVID-19 prediction, fertility tracking, heat-related illness, drug effects, and psychological interventions; they also included underrepresented populations, such as individuals with rare diseases. There is a lack of research on wearable devices in low-resource contexts. Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, we see a shift toward more large-sized, web-based studies where wearables increased insights into the developing pandemic, including forecasting models and the effects of the pandemic. Some studies have indicated that big data extracted from wearables may potentially transform the understanding of population health dynamics and the ability to forecast health trends.Copyright ©Sophie Huhn, Miriam Axt, Hanns-Christian Gunga, Martina Anna Maggioni, Stephen Munga, David Obor, Ali Sie, Valentin Boudo, Aditi Bunker, Rainer Sauerborn, Till Barnighausen, Sandra Barteit.

   abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have caused a paradigm shift in healthcare that can be used for decision support and forecasting by exploring medical data. Recent studies have shown that AI and ML can be used to fight COVID-19. The objective of this article is to summarize the recent AI- and ML-based studies that have addressed the pandemic. From an initial set of 634 articles, a total of 49 articles were finally selected through an inclusion-exclusion process. In this article, we have explored the objectives of the existing studies (i.e., the role of AI/ML in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic); the context of the studies (i.e., whether it was focused on a specific country-context or with a global perspective; the type and volume of the dataset; and the methodology, algorithms, and techniques adopted in the prediction or diagnosis processes). We have mapped the algorithms and techniques with the data type by highlighting their prediction/classification accuracy. From our analysis, we categorized the objectives of the studies into four groups: disease detection, epidemic forecasting, sustainable development, and disease diagnosis. We observed that most of these studies used deep learning algorithms on image-data, more specifically on chest X-rays and CT scans. We have identified six future research opportunities that we have summarized in this paper. Impact Statement: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning(ML) methods have been widely used to assist in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. A very few in-depth literature reviews have been conducted to synthesize the knowledge and identify future research agenda including a previously published review on data science for COVID-19 in this article. In this article, we synthesized reviewed recent literature that focuses on the usages and applications of AI and ML to fight against COVID-19. We have identified seven future research directions that would guide researchers to conduct future research. The most significant of these are: develop new treatment options, explore the contextual effect and variation in research outcomes, support the health care workforce, and explore the effect and variation in research outcomes based on different types of data.},

   pages = {e0276981},
   abstract = {Understanding the structure of human sexual contact networks is vital in a broad range of disciplines, including sociology, biology, public health, and anthropology. However, sexual contact networks are yet to be understood because technical and privacy issues make it difficult to conduct accurate, large-scale surveys. In this study, we surveyed data openly available on one of the largest adult entertainment websites in Japan, where male clients (MCs) can write online customer reviews of female commercial sex workers (FCSWs). In particular, our investigation focused on a type of establishment called "soapland," the only type of sex industry in Japan where sexual intercourse is publicly permitted. Soaplands are scattered throughout Japan, and the study website covers approximately 66% of them. Using such a vast amount of data on a nationwide scale, we clarified the network structure of commercial sex, characterized by small-world, scale-free, and disassortative mating properties. To study geographical characteristics, we compared the resulting network with three different artificially generated networks via the random rewiring of links. Moreover, we considered a simple epidemic model on the resulting network, and investigated whether it would be more effective to provide infection control measures to FCSWs or MCs. We determined that active FCSWs constitute an important pathway of infection propagation in commercial sex networks, but MCs also play an essential role as weak ties.},

   abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak to be a public health emergency and international concern and recognized it as a pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the epidemiologic parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic for clinical and epidemiological help. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis study, 4 electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for the literature published from early December 2019 up to 23 March 2020. After screening, we selected 76 articles based on epidemiological parameters, including basic reproduction number, serial interval, incubation period, doubling time, growth rate, case-fatality rate, and the onset of symptom to hospitalization as eligibility criteria. For the estimation of overall pooled epidemiologic parameters, fixed and random effect models with 95% CI were used based on the value of between-study heterogeneity (I2). Results: A total of 76 observational studies were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for R0 was 2.99 (95% CI, 2.71-3.27) for COVID-19. The overall R0 was 3.23, 1.19, 3.6, and 2.35 for China, Singapore, Iran, and Japan, respectively. The overall serial interval, doubling time, and incubation period were 4.45 (95% CI, 4.03-4.87), 4.14 (95% CI, 2.67-5.62), and 4.24 (95% CI, 3.03-5.44) days for COVID-19. In addition, the overall estimation for the growth rate and the case fatality rate for COVID-19 was 0.38% and 3.29%, respectively. Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 as an emerging disease may be revealed by computing the pooled estimate of the epidemiological parameters, opening the door for health policymakers to consider additional control measures.

   abstract = {Background: People with disabilities (PwD) have been facing multiple health, social, and economic disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic, stemming from structural disparities experienced for long time. This paper aims to present the PREparedness, RESponse and SySTemic transformation (PRE-RE-SyST): a model for a disability-inclusive pandemic responses and systematic disparities reduction. Method(s): Scoping review with a thematic analysis was conducted on the literature published up to mid-September 2020, equating to the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven scientific databases and three preprint databases were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing health and socio-economic disparities experienced by PwD as well as reporting actions to address them. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation were also conducted. Two independent reviewers made eligibility decisions and performed data extractions on any action or recommended action to address disparities. A thematic analysis was then used for the model construction, informed by a systems-thinking approach (i.e., the Iceberg Model). Result(s): From 1027 unique references, 84 were included in the final analysis. The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates a four-level strategic action to: 1) Respond to prevent or reduce disability disparities during a pandemic crisis; 2) Prepare ahead for pandemic and other crises responses; 3) Design systems and policies for a structural disability-inclusiveness; and 4) Transform society's cultural assumptions about disability. 'Simple rules' and literature-based examples on how these strategies can be deployed are provided. Conclusion(s): The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates main strategies, 'simple rules' and possible means whereby public health authorities, policy-makers, and other stakeholders can address disability disparities in pandemic crises, and beyond. Beyond immediate pandemic responses, disability-inclusiveness is needed to develop everyday equity-oriented policies and practices that can transform societies towards greater resiliency, as a whole, to pandemic and other health and social emergencies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background The WHO's Research and Development Blueprint priority list designates emerging diseases with the potential to generate public health emergencies for which insufficient preventive solutions exist. The list aims to reduce the time to the availability of resources that can avert public health crises. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates that an effective method of mitigating such crises is the pre-emptive prediction of outbreaks. This scoping review thus aimed to map and identify the evidence available to predict future outbreaks of the Blueprint diseases. Methods We conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science related to the evidence predicting future outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus, Zika virus, Lassa fever, Nipah and Henipaviral disease, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Disease X. Prediction methods, outbreak features predicted and implementation of predictions were evaluated. We conducted a narrative and quantitative evidence synthesis to highlight prediction methods that could be further investigated for the prevention of Blueprint diseases and COVID-19 outbreaks. Results Out of 3959 articles identified, we included 58 articles based on inclusion criteria. 5 major prediction methods emerged; the most frequent being spatio-temporal risk maps predicting outbreak risk periods and locations through vector and climate data. Stochastic models were predominant. Rift Valley fever was the most predicted disease. Diseases with complex sociocultural factors such as Ebola were often predicted through multifactorial risk-based estimations. 10% of models were implemented by health authorities. No article predicted Disease X outbreaks. Conclusions Spatiotemporal models for diseases with strong climatic and vectorial components, as in River Valley fever prediction, may currently best reduce the time to the availability of resources. A wide literature gap exists in the prediction of zoonoses with complex sociocultural and ecological dynamics such as Ebola, COVID-19 and especially Disease X.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

   journal = {International Journal of Medical Informatics},
   volume = {151},
   pages = {104470},
   abstract = {Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impacts have disrupted our health systems and society. We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. Method(s): We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. Result(s): We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were "perspectives" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement "in-person" primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care. There is a need for more research into how telehealth and virtual models of care can improve the access, integration, safety, and quality of virtual primary care.Copyright © 2021},

   abstract = {Contact tracing is commonly recommended to control outbreaks of COVID-19, but its effectiveness is unclear. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched four databases using a range of terms related to contact tracing effectiveness for COVID-19. We found 343 papers; 32 were included. All were observational or modelling studies. Observational studies (n = 14) provided consistent, very-low certainty evidence that contact tracing (alone or in combination with other interventions) was associated with better control of COVID-19 (e.g. in Hong Kong, only 1084 cases and four deaths were recorded in the first 4.5 months of the pandemic). Modelling studies (n = 18) provided consistent, high-certainty evidence that under assumptions of prompt and thorough tracing with effective quarantines, contact tracing could stop the spread of COVID-19 (e.g. by reducing the reproduction number from 2.2 to 0.57). A cautious interpretation indicates that to stop the spread of COVID-19, public health practitioners have 2-3 days from the time a new case develops symptoms to isolate the case and quarantine at least 80% of its contacts.

   abstract = {Lessons learnt from the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak indicate the need for a more coordinated economic and public health response. While social distancing has been shown to be effective as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measure to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the economic costs have been substantial. Insights combining epidemiological and economic data provide new theoretical predictions that can be used to better understand the health economy tradeoffs. This literature review aims to elucidate perspectives to assist policy implementation related to the management of the ongoing and impending outbreaks regarding the Health Economic Dilemma (HED). This review unveiled the need for information-based decision-support systems which will combine pandemic spread modelling and control, with economic models. It is expected that the current review will not only support policy makers but will also provide researchers on the development of related decision-support-systems with comprehensive information on the various aspects of the HED.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   volume = {19},

   pages = {241-261},
   abstract = {Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the constant transformation of the SARS-COV-2 virus form, exposure to substantial psychosocial stress, environmental change, and isolation have led to the inference that the overall population's mental health could be affected, resulting in an increase in cases of psychosis. Objective(s): We initiated a systematic review to determine the impact of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its long-term effects-in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases-on people with or without psychosis. We envisioned that this would give us an insight into effective clinical intervention methods for patients with psychosis during and after the pandemic. Method(s): We selected fifteen papers that met our inclusion criteria, i.e., those that considered participants with or without psychiatric illness and exposed to SARS-COV-2 infection, for this review and were retrieved via Google, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsychINFO Database. Key Gap: There is a dearth of research in understanding how COVID-19 affects people with or without a prior personal history of psychosis. Result(s): The systematic review summary provides insight into the state of knowledge. Insights from the systematic review have also been reviewed from the salutogenesis model's perspec-tive. There is moderate evidence of new-onset psychosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in which some antipsychotics treated the psychotic symptoms of patients while treating for COVID-19. Suggestions and recommendations are made for preventive and promotive public health strategies. Conclusion(s): The Salutogenesis model and Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) provide another preventive and promotive public health management approach.Copyright © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.},

   abstract = {Background: Digital Twins (DTs), virtual copies of physical entities, are a promising tool to help manage and predict outbreaks of Covid-19. By providing a detailed model of each patient, DTs can be used to determine what method of care will be most effective for that individual. The improvement in patient experience and care delivery will help to reduce demand on healthcare services and to improve hospital management., Objectives: The aim of this study is to address 2 research questions: (1) How effective are DTs in predicting and managing infectious diseases such as Covid-19? and (2) What are the prospects and challenges associated with the use of DTs in healthcare?, Methods: The review was structured according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. Titles and abstracts of references in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar were searched using selected keywords (relating to digital twins, healthcare and Covid-19). The papers were screened in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria so that all papers published in English relating to the use of digital twins in healthcare were included. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the included papers., Results: Eighteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. None of the included papers examined the use of DTs in the context of Covid-19, or infectious disease outbreaks in general. Academic research about the applications, opportunities and challenges of DT technology in healthcare in general was found to be in early stages., Conclusions: The review identifies a need for further research into the use of DTs in healthcare, particularly in the context of infectious disease outbreaks. Based on frameworks identified during the review, this paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for the use of DTs for hospital management during the Covid-19 outbreak to address this research gap.

   journal = {Environmental Research},
   volume = {212},
   pages = {113436},
   abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a major public health risk in many countries. The current incidence of disease exceeds guidelines proposed by the World Health Organisation and United Nations. Whilst the relationship between climate change and TB has surfaced in recent literature, it remains neglected in global agendas. There is a need to acknowledge TB as a climate-sensitive disease to facilitate its eradication. Objective(s): To review epidemiological and prediction model studies that explore how climate change may affect the risk factors for TB, as outlined in the Global Tuberculosis Report 2021: HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, undernutrition, overcrowding, poverty, and indoor air pollution. Method(s): We conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify studies examining the association between climate variables and the risk factors for TB. Each study that satisfied the inclusion criteria was assessed for quality and ethics. Studies then underwent vote-counting and were categorised based on whether an association was found. Result(s): 53 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Vote-counting revealed that two out of two studies found a positive association between the examined climate change proxy and HIV, nine out of twelve studies for diabetes, eight out of seventeen studies for undernutrition, four out of five studies for overcrowding, twelve out of fifteen studies for poverty and one out of three studies for indoor air pollution. Discussion(s): We found evidence supporting a positive association between climate change and each of the discussed risk factors for TB, excluding indoor air pollution. Our findings suggest that climate change is likely to affect the susceptibility of individuals to TB by increasing the prevalence of its underlying risk factors, particularly in developing countries. This is an evolving field of research that requires further attention in the scientific community.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Using a discrete stochastic transmission model, we estimated that multilevel policies, including extensive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, reduced contact rates by 90% and rapidly decreased the epidemic in Daegu and nationwide during February-March 2020. Absence of these prompt responses could have resulted in a >10-fold increase in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by May 15, 2020, relative to the status quo. The model suggests that reallocation of persons who have mild or asymptomatic cases to community treatment centers helped avoid overwhelming hospital capacity and enabled healthcare workers to provide care for more severely and critically ill patients in hospital beds and negative-pressure intensive care units. As small outbreaks continue to occur, contact tracing and maintenance of hospital capacity are needed.},

   abstract = {Applied epidemiological models have played a critical role in understanding the transmission and control of disease outbreaks. Their utility and accuracy in decision-making on appropriate responses during public health emergencies is however a factor of their calibration to local data, evidence informing model assumptions, speed of obtaining and communicating their results, ease of understanding and willingness by policymakers to use their insights. We conducted a systematic review of infectious disease models focused on SARS-CoV-2 in Africa to determine: a) spatial and temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 modelling in Africa, b) use of local data to calibrate the models and local expertise in modelling activities, and c) key modelling questions and policy insights. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and MedRxiv databases following the PRISMA guidelines to obtain all SARS-CoV-2 dynamic modelling papers for one or multiple African countries. We extracted data on countries studied, authors and their affiliations, modelling questions addressed, type of models used, use of local data to calibrate the models, and model insights for guiding policy decisions. A total of 74 papers met the inclusion criteria, with nearly two-thirds of these coming from 6% (3) of the African countries. Initial papers were published 2 months after the first cases were reported in Africa, with most papers published after the first wave. More than half of all papers (53, 78%) and (48, 65%) had a first and last author affiliated to an African institution respectively, and only 12% (9) used local data for model calibration. A total of 60% (46) of the papers modelled assessment of control interventions. The transmission rate parameter was found to drive the most uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis for majority of the models. The use of dynamic models to draw policy insights was crucial and therefore there is need to increase modelling capacity in the continent.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

This integrative review systematically explored the socioecological factors that impacted and influenced these movement behaviours in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021, with data extracted from 16 articles (n = 18,352; 5-17 years; 12 countries). Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT), with correlates identified, coded, and themed via thematic analysis.

For sedentary time/behaviour, individual-(age and sex), social-(family factors) and policy-(COVID-19-related rules) level factors may be important correlates. There were no age or sex associations with PA levels, though there was some indication that sedentary time/behaviour increased with age. Interventions seeking to enhance young people's movement behaviours during periods of enforced restrictions should focus on enhancing opportunities on a social and environmental level.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

This integrative review interrogated available literature to explore the pandemic's impact on correlates of such behaviours in adults (>=18 years). Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021. Data extracted from 64 articles were assessed for risk-of-bias using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool, with correlates identified, coded, and themed via thematic analysis.

For sedentary time/behaviour, individual level factors, namely general and mental health, may be important correlates. Neither age or sex were clearly correlated with either behaviour. As we transition into a new normal, understanding which behaviour mechanisms could effectively challenge physical inactivity is essential. Targeting capability on a psychological level may facilitate PA and limit sedentary time/behaviour, whereas, on a physical level, maximizing PA opportunities could be crucial.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Introduction Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. Methods To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. Results 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barre Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. Conclusions Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.Copyright This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

   abstract = {Objective: This review describes the current scenario of a priority group of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) listed by World Health Organization (WHO), and their main determinants and drivers for the emergence/spread of the diseases. The gaps and strategies developed by India to meet the WHO guidelines on the effective control of epidemic-prone diseases and outbreaks are also presented in the review. Method(s): Epidemiologic information of EIDs, namely Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola and Marburg viruses (EboV and MarV), Zika virus (ZIKAV), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah and Hendra virus (NiV and HeV), and Lassa fever virus (LASV), was drawn from international and national electronic databases to assess the situation. A brief view on the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India is also included. Result(s): There are no reports for human infection of EboV, MarV, RVF, and LASV in India. CCHF, SARS, ZIKAV, and NiV have been involved in outbreaks in eight states of India, while COVID-19 is currently reported from majority of states. India has deeply strengthened its surveillance and response system of outbreaks and epidemic-prone diseases. Conclusion(s): Despite its enormous improvements made in the anticipation of such threats, still more efforts are needed in sensitization of populations as well as hospital management in the context to EIDs, as addressed in the review. Furthermore, there is still a need for more research and development activities to efficiently control EIDs.© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

   journal = {PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases},
   volume = {15},
   number = {9},
   pages = {e0009631},
   abstract = {Background This systematic review aims to assess how different urbanisation patterns related to rapid urban growth, unplanned expansion, and human population density affect the establishment and distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and create favourable conditions for the spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Methods and findings Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following: Human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the study's limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely "Aedes ecology" and "transmission dynamics." There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies. Conclusions The use of different methods in the included studies highlights the interplay of multiple factors linking urbanisation with ecological, entomological, and epidemiological parameters and the need to consider a variety of these factors for designing effective public health approaches.Copyright © 2021 Kolimenakis et al.},

   volume = {12},
   number = {Supplement 1},
   abstract = {Introduction: The survival of pathogens is an important criterion to assess the risk of nosocomial transmissions, infections, outbreaks and thus for infection prevention/control. Objective(s): The aim of this review is to refine the knowledge on this issue with regards to influencing environmental factors. Method(s): To update and expand the evidence, a systematic literature search (Pubmed, Web of Science; 26.01.2023) according to PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Abstract/full-text screening and data extraction was done by four reviewers on a four-eye-principle using predefined in- and exclusion criteria. Result(s): A total of 172 publications were included. Factors influencing the survival of pathogens in the environment were: (a) microbiological test conditions: The origin of the pathogen, initial inoculum, desiccation, relative humidity and temperature during storage, re-cultivation conditions and stage of cultivability are all influential; (b) surface material: Survival on copper is shorter than on other materials due to its oligodynamic effect, survival on porous surfaces is longer; (c) relative humidity (RH): Gram-positive bacteria tolerate dry conditions better than Gramnegative bacteria due to their cell wall. Enveloped viruses retain their replicate capacity longer with low RH unlike non-enveloped viruses; (d) temperature: Temperatures > 24 degreeC seem to reduce the survival of bacteria in the air. The viral genome is sensitive to higher surrounding temperature; (e) lighting: Especially sunlight decreases the survival of e.g. SARS-CoV-2; (f) protein, fecal and urine load: Desiccation in protein-containing media prolongs survival proven for different bacteria and yeast; (g) biofilm: formation prolongs bacterial survival. Conclusion(s): There is a lack of good clinical epidemiological evidence for transmission scenarios. Considering all influencing factors, data generated under laboratory conditions can only provide a rough orientation on the pathogen tenacity.},

   title = {Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid scoping review},
   journal = {Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews},
   volume = {2020},
   number = {12},
   pages = {CD013812},
   abstract = {Background: In response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of COVID-19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. Objective(s): To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. Search Method(s): We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. Selection Criteria: We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. Data Collection and Analysis: We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). Main Result(s): We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regio (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. Authors' conclusions: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The stringent measures to control the spread of COVID-19 results a significant slowdown in economic activities which in turn affected the environment by reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically lower atmospheric CO2 levels. Considering that, the present study intends to highlight the substantial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on GHG emissions, by systematically reviewing the available scientific literatures. The study further outlined the variation in GHG emissions by comparing the data focused on pre-pandemic, during pandemic, and post-pandemic (predictions) scenarios. Further, the assessment on elevating CO2 levels, global economic, and energy impacts of COVID-19 has also been reviewed. Also, the possible recovery plan for the framework of sustainable environmental and energy development is presented. Finally, the review concludes with an insightful summary involving the challenges and future outlook towards sustainable development goals in a hope that the present study can help the researchers to assess the global environmental and energy related consequences.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Mortality statistics are fundamental to understand the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to limitation of real-time data availability, researchers had used mathematical models to estimate excess mortality globally during COVID-19 pandemic. As they demonstrated variations in scope, assumptions, estimations, and magnitude of the pandemic, and hence raised a controversy all over the world. This paper aims to review the mathematical models and their estimates of mortality due to COVID-19 in the Indian context. The PRISMA and SWiM guidelines were followed to the best possible extent. A twostep search strategy was used to identify studies that estimated excess deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 on Medline, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv available until 0100 h, 16 May 2022 (IST).We selected 13 studies based on a predefined criteria and extracted data on a standardised, pre-piloted form by two investigators, independently. Any discordance was resolved through consensus with a senior investigator. Estimated excess mortality was analysed using statistical software and depicted using appropriate graphs. Significant variations in scope, population, data sources, time period, and modelling strategies existed across studies along with a high risk of bias. Most of the models were based on Poisson regression. Predicted excess mortality by various models ranged from 1.1 to 9.5 million. The review presents a summary of all the estimates of excess deaths and is important to understand the different strategies used for estimation, and it highlights the importance of data availability, assumptions, and estimates.Copyright © 2023},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on healthcare systems worldwide. In particular, long-term care facilities have proved more susceptible to infection as they care for vulnerable populations at high risk of chronic illness. How this impacts the role and core competencies of health and care workers in these facilities remains less understood. AIM: Describe how health and care workers contribute to the prevention of emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities. DESIGN: A scoping review. METHOD(S): A systematic search of literature dating from 2002 to 2022 was conducted in the following databases: EMBASE, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Web of Science, and AgeLine. Studies were selected if they focused on health and care workers in long-term care facilities, offered a perspective on the prevention of emerging infectious diseases or infection prevention and control, and were original qualitative or quantitative studies in English. Data were extracted, cross-checked and analyzed by two researchers, and any difference in views regarding the appropriateness of literature would be resolved by consulting a third researcher. An inductive descriptive approach was applied for the analysis of results, and themes were established via consensus meetings. RESULT(S): A total of fourteen studies from Asia, Europe, and the Americas were included. Three themes emerged from the review: "The roles of health and care workers evolve with the times", "The core competencies of health and care workers are essential for preventing emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities" and "The key to successful prevention of emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities is through a systematic, comprehensive effort that mobilize health and care workers at all levels". Health and care workers had to take on increasingly complex roles and rely on their core competencies to cope with epidemic changes, and facility resources, employee quality and management models were found to have significantly improved infection prevention and control outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): The roles of health and care workers are evolving, and effective infection prevention within long-term care facilities depends on their ability to perform core competencies with skill and confidence. Moreover, a systematic, comprehensive framework, for which this paper proposes three guidelines, is urgently needed to ensure consistent policy implementation within the facility as well as support and access to resources for health and care workers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Infection prevention efforts within long-term care facilities must take into account the evolving roles of health and care workers, with a focus on guaranteeing access to resources, training and support that will help them gain the core competencies necessary for juggling those roles. In addition, there is an urgent need for research instruments that will help assess those competencies and identify areas of improvement.Copyright © 2023 Sigma Theta Tau International.},

   title = {Reviewing, appraising, and synthesizing observational data to inform dynamic mathematical modeling of HCV and HIV transmission among people who inject drugs in Montreal, Canada},
   journal = {Canadian Liver Journal},
   volume = {3},
   number = {1},
   pages = {40-41},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canada is not on track for eliminating the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a public health threat by 2030. Pursuing micro-elimination among people who inject drugs (PWID) living with HIV is key to meeting this goal. Dynamic mathematical models of disease transmission can evaluate the potential impact of prevention and treatment intervention scenarios prior to scaleup. There has been no such modeling performed for HCV-HIV co-infected PWID in Canada. The wealth of surveillance and epidemiological data available in Montreal represents an opportunity to fill these research gaps. One challenge to modeling is the synthesis of multiple primary and secondary data sources to inform model parametrization. PURPOSE: We aim to i) identify the parameters to estimate; ii) determine observational data availability and gaps; iii) appraise the potential biases inherent to these data and assess their impact on parameter estimates; and iv) elicit appropriate prior distributions for model parameters. METHOD(S): Model parameters from four domains will be estimated: demography, biology, behaviours, and the public health response. We will systematically search for bio-behavioural data collected among PWID in Montreal between 2000- 2019 by conducting reviews of the peer-reviewed literature and reports from provincial and federal health authorities. Some parameters will be directly estimated from individual-level data (primary data sources), and others from published sources (secondary data sources). Both types of estimates will include quantification of random error. Epidemiological studies are also subject to systematic error, and this is particularly true among hard-toreach populations for which sampling frames are generally not available. For each parameter value estimated from one/several data source(s), we will conduct probabilistic bias analyses to estimate the direction, magnitude, and uncertainty arising from potential uncontrolled confounding, selection bias, and measurement error. The quantitative evidence generated on random and systematic error will allow us to then elicit appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, thereby resolving potential conflicts between different data sources and weighting these sources of information based on their relative quality. RESULT(S): The 22 parameters to estimate are listed in Table 1. To date, we have identified three data sources for parametrization: the Canadian co-infection cohort (2003-), a prospective study of health outcomes among 1,983 HIV-HCV coinfected individuals across Canada for which we have individual-level data; SurvUDI (1995-), repeated cross-sectional bio-behavioural surveys of HIV and HCV among PWID in Quebec; and the Saint-Luc Cohort (1998-), a longitudinal study of HIV and HCV determinants among 1,451 Montreal PWID. Parameters that cannot be estimated using local data will be gathered from public health reports or peer-reviewed literature involving populations in comparable contexts. Additional expected results include detailed outcomes of the bias analyses, as well as the elicited prior distribution for each parameter (Table). CONCLUSION(S): Dynamic epidemic modeling requires integrating information from multiple data sources. We provide one of the few examples of data synthesis, accounting for sources of random and systematic error in primary and secondary data sources, in order to parametrize a dynamic, deterministic, compartmental model of both HCV and HIV transmission among Montreal PWID.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias., METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework-Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement., RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.

   pages = {63},
   abstract = {Introduction: During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, regional modelling predicted an acute surge in the demand for level 2 respiratory beds. Locally, these patients were cared for on the ICU.Capacity expanded from20 to 42 beds in response to the pandemic, but the anticipated demand could not be met in the existing critical care footprint. Early evidence suggested that CPAP and high-flow oxygen could reduce the requirement for mechanical ventilation by up to 50% for patients with Covid-19.1-2 Objectives and Methods: * An enhanced respiratory care a rea was created for a cohort of level 2 respiratory patients to provide CPAP and High-Flow oxygen on a 1:4 practitioner to patient ratio with the aim of relieving staffing and bed pressures on ICU whilst providing equitable care and outcomes to that given to patients on the main unit * Admission criteria stipulated patients should have either single organ failure, independence with self-care, capacity and/or pre-established escalation status * The area was staffed by an acute care team, a team of practitioners from a variety of professional backgrounds including nursing and AHP's who normally provided the Trust's citical care outreach and acute care support through advanced cinical practitioners, non-medical prescribers, practitioners, and specialist HCAs. Physiotherapists and junior doctors were assigned to the unit and supported with their typical professional roles and bedside care. * A service review was undertaken including analysis of admission data, length of stay and unit mortality. A retrospective clinical audit measuring care delivered against the area's initial standard operating procedure and objectives was also undertaken against 15% of patient notes. Result(s): *67 patients admitted over 40 days *247 critical care bed days saved *Median length of stay 3.68 days *50.7% patients stepped down to wards; 34.3% escalated to critical care; 14.9% died. *Median age 63, 2:1 male: female ratio Conclusion(s): The enhanced respiratory care area provided an innovative response to the local critical care COVID-19 bed crisis by cohorting level 2 respiratory patients and transformational workforce planning and care modelling. This enabled a rapid and targeted response to the crisis which provided quality care that was at least equivalent to the length of stay and mortality outcomes of the local ICU, whilst significantly reducing ICU bed and workforce pressures.},

   abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread throughout China and the rest of the world. Many mathematical models have been developed to understand and predict the infectiousness of COVID-19. We aim to summarize these models to inform efforts to manage the current outbreak. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, Preprints, and National Knowledge Infrastructure (Chinese database) for relevant studies published between 1 December 2019 and 21 February 2020. References were screened for additional publications. Crucial indicators were extracted and analysed. We also built a mathematical model for the evolution of the epidemic in Wuhan that synthesised extracted indicators. Result(s): Fifty-two articles involving 75 mathematical or statistical models were included in our systematic review. The overall median basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.78-5.13], which dropped to a controlled reproduction number (Rc) of 1.88 (IQR 1.41-2.24) after city lockdown. The median incubation and infectious periods were 5.90 (IQR 4.78-6.25) and 9.94 (IQR 3.93-13.50) days, respectively. The median case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.9% (IQR 2.3-5.4%). Our mathematical model showed that, in Wuhan, the peak time of infection is likely to be March 2020 with a median size of 98,333 infected cases (range 55,225-188,284). The earliest elimination of ongoing transmission is likely to be achieved around 7 May 2020. Conclusion(s): Our analysis found a sustained Rc and prolonged incubation/ infectious periods, suggesting COVID-19 is highly infectious. Although interventions in China have been effective in controlling secondary transmission, sustained global efforts are needed to contain an emerging pandemic. Alternative interventions can be explored using modelling studies to better inform policymaking as the outbreak continues.Copyright © 2020 Lin, Duan, Zhou, Yuan, Li, Fitzpatrick, Fu, Feng, Luo, Zhan, Liang, Fan, Lu, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Gao, Li, Chen, Chen, Ao, Li, Cai, Du, Shu and Zou.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emerging virus is rampaging globally. A growing number of pediatric infected cases have been reported. Great efforts are needed to cut down the transmission., METHODS: A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and several Chinese databases for studies presenting characteristics of children confirmed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from December 12, 2019 to May 10, 2020. Quality Appraisal of Case Series Studies Checklist was used to assess quality and publication bias was analyzed by Egger's test. Random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled incidence rate (IR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), or a fixed model instead when I2 < 50%. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region. Additionally, we searched United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization to see how different countries act to the education disruption in COVID-19., RESULTS: 29 studies with 4300 pediatric patients were included. The mean age was 7.04 (95% CI: 5.06-9.08) years old. 18.9% of children were asymptomatic (95% CI: 0.121-0.266), 37.4% (95% CI: 0.280-0.474) had no radiographic abnormalities. Besides, a proportion of 0.1% patients were admitted to intensive care units (0, 95% CI: 0.000-0.013) and four deaths were reported (0, 95% CI: 0.000-0.000). Up to 159 countries have implemented nationwide school closures, affecting over 70% of the world's students., CONCLUSION: Children were also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while critical cases or deaths were rare. Characterized by mild presentation, the dilemma that children may become a potential spreader in the pandemic, while strict managements like prolonged school closures, may undermine their well-beings. Thus, the public policies are facing challenge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHOD: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures., RESULTS: We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2 and 5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7 to 26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults., CONCLUSION: Information on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

   abstract = {Mathematical modeling studies are frequently conducted to guide policy in global health. However, the contribution of mathematical modeling studies to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommendations, and the quality of evidence contributed by these studies remains unknown. We conducted a systematic review of the WHO Guidelines Review Committee database to identify guideline recommendations that included evidence from mathematical modeling studies since inception of the Guidelines Review Committee on 1 December, 2007. We included WHO guideline recommendations citing a mathematical modeling study in the primary evidence base. We defined a mathematical model as a framework that predicted epidemiologic, health or economic impact of an intervention or decision in the clinical or public health context. The primary outcome was inclusion of evidence from mathematical modeling studies in a guideline recommendation. We evaluated each unique modeling study across multiple domains of quality. Between 1 December 2007 and 1 April 2019, the WHO Guidelines Review Committee approved 154 guidelines providing 1619 guideline recommendations. Mathematical modeling studies informed 46 WHO guidelines (29.9%) and 101 unique guideline recommendations (6.2%). Modeling evidence addressed topics related to infectious diseases in 38 guidelines (82.6%) and 81 recommendations (80.2%), most commonly for HIV and tuberculosis. Evidence from modeling studies was assessed in the GRADE evidence profile for 12 recommendations (12.9%) and GRADE evidence-to-decision framework for 45 recommendations (44.6%). Modeling-informed recommendations were more likely than other recommendations within the same guidelines to be issued with a "conditional" rather than "strong" strength of recommendation (53.5% versus 37.8%), and the evidence underlying modeling-informed recommendations was more likely to be assessed as very low quality (41.6% versus 24.1%). Upon review of individual modeling studies, we estimated that 33.8% of models performed a calibration, 29.4% of models performed a validation of results, and 20.6% of models reported a change in the study conclusion in the sensitivity analysis. While policy recommendations in WHO guidelines are informed by evidence from modeling studies, the validity of modeling studies included in guidelines development is heterogeneous. Quality assessment is needed to support the evaluation and incorporation of evidence from mathematical modeling studies in guidelines development.Copyright © 2022 The Authors},

   pages = {661078},
   abstract = {Background: Due to lack of preparedness of health systems, fast spread of the new virus, high mortality rates, and lack of a definite treatment, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to high levels of fear and anxiety in different populations. In addition, isolation, mental disorders, and limitations in social interactions as a result of lockdown and travel ban increased the fear of the new coronavirus. Methods: International databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar, were searched without any time limitation, and all observational studies published in English reporting the mean of fear of COVID-19 based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) were included in the analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Random effects model, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Heterogeneity across studies was examined using Cochran's Q test and I 2 statistic. All the statistical analyses were conducted using R software v4.0.3. Results: A total of 44 articles with a sample size of 52,462 were reviewed. A pooled mean of 18.57 was found for fear of COVID-19. The mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in women than in men (20.67 vs. 18.21). The highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 had been found in Asia (18.36) and Australia (17.43) based on continent, and in hospital staff (19.51) and college students (17.95) based on target population, respectively. In addition, the highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 were related to items #1 and #3 of the scale, respectively. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, there was no significant association between the mean of fear of COVID-19 and sample size and participants' age. In addition, publication error was not significant (P = 0.721). Conclusion: The mean of fear of COVID-19 was high around the world; therefore, it seems necessary to pay more attention to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold tremendous potential for tackling key aspects of pandemic management and response. In the present review, we discuss the tremendous possibilities of AI technology in addressing the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we outline the multiple impacts of the current pandemic on public health, the economy, and society. Next, we focus on the innovative applications of advanced AI technologies in key areas such as COVID-19 prediction, detection, control, and drug discovery for treatment. Specifically, AI-based predictive analytics models can use clinical, epidemiological, and omics data to forecast disease spread and patient outcomes. Additionally, deep neural networks enable rapid diagnosis through medical imaging. Intelligent systems can support risk assessment, decision-making, and social sensing, thereby improving epidemic control and public health policies. Furthermore, high-throughput virtual screening enables AI to accelerate the identification of therapeutic drug candidates and opportunities for drug repurposing. Finally, we discuss future research directions for AI technology in combating COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Though promising, barriers related to model generalization, data quality, infrastructure readiness, and ethical risks must be addressed to fully translate these innovations into real-world impacts. Multidisciplinary collaboration engaging diverse expertise and stakeholders is imperative for developing robust, responsible, and human-centered AI solutions against COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.

   journal = {Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)},
   volume = {56},
   number = {12},
   abstract = {Background and Objectives: The aims of this systematic review were to identify additional infection control measures implemented in dental practice globally to prevent cross-infection and evaluate the psychological impacts of the pandemic among dental professionals. Material(s) and Method(s): A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: "COVID-19" (n = 12,137), "Novel corona virus" (n = 63), "COVID-19 and dentistry" (n = 46), "COVID-19 and oral health" (n = 41), "Novel Corona virus and Dentistry" (n = 0), "dental health and Novel Coronavirus" (n = 26), and "dental practice and Novel Coronavirus" (n = 6). Result(s): After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of >100.4 F or 38 degreeC should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusion(s): Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm. More research highlighting evidence-based safety practices and multisectoral collaboration is required to help dental professionals make informed decisions and make the profession safe, both for the patient and dental professionals.},

   abstract = {A 'new' way of dreaming has emerged during the pandemic, enhancing the interest of psychological literature. Indeed, during the years of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many studies have investigated dream-related phenomena and dreaming functions. Considering the constant and rapid emergence of new results on this topic, the main aim of this study was to create an 'observatory' on the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on dreaming, by means of a living systematic review. The baseline results are presented, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines, to identify and discuss existing studies about dreams and dreaming during the COVID-19 pandemic published until February 2022. Web of Science, Embase, EBSCO, and PubMed were used for the search strategy, yielding 71 eligible papers included in the review. Our results show: (a) a more intense oneiric activity during lockdown; (b) changes in dreaming components (especially dream-recall and nightmare frequency); (c) a particular dreaming scenario ('pandemic dreams'); (d) an alteration of the dreaming-waking-life continuum and a specific function of dreaming as emotional regulator. Findings suggest that monitoring changes in dreaming provides important information about psychological health and could also contribute to the debate on the difficulties of dreaming, as well as sleeping, in particular during and after a period of 'collective trauma'.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

   abstract = {Background: Forecasting the behavior of epidemic outbreaks is vital in public health. This makes it possible to anticipate the planning and organization of the health system, as well as possible restrictive or preventive measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this need for prediction has been crucial. This paper attempts to characterize the alternative models that were applied in the first wave of this pandemic context, trying to shed light that could help to understand them for future practical applications. Method(s): A systematic literature search was performed in standardized bibliographic repertoires, using keywords and Boolean operators to refine the findings, and selecting articles according to the main PRISMA 2020 statement recommendations. Result(s): After identifying models used throughout the first wave of this pandemic (between March and June 2020), we begin by examining standard data-driven epidemiological models, including studies applying models such as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered), SQUIDER, SEIR, time-dependent SIR, and other alternatives. For data-driven methods, we identify experiences using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), evolutionary genetic programming machine learning, short-term memory (LSTM), and global epidemic and mobility models. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic has led to intensive and evolving use of alternative infectious disease prediction models. At this point it is not easy to decide which prediction method is the best in a generic way. Moreover, although models such as the LSTM emerge as remarkably versatile and useful, the practical applicability of the alternatives depends on the specific context of the underlying variable and on the information of the target to be prioritized. In addition, the robustness of the assessment is conditioned by heterogeneity in the quality of information sources and differences in the characteristics of disease control interventions. Further comprehensive comparison of the performance of models in comparable situations, assessing their predictive validity, is needed. This will help determine the most reliable and practical methods for application in future outbreaks and eventual pandemics.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   journal = {BMC public health},
   volume = {22},
   number = {1},
   pages = {189},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, when it was first reported in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China, the new virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly around the world and has become a global pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the public health measures implemented, people's sexual activity has also been affected. Restrictions on people's activities, reduced sports activities, economic issues, increased psychological stress, and reduced entertainment have, indeed, dramatically impacted sexual activity and functioning. The purpose of this study was tosystematically identify, collect and summarize the existing body of evidence from published studies on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual activity and functioning. METHOD(S): Several scholarly databases, namely MEDLINE (via PubMed interface), Web of Science (WOS), Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases, were mined from December 2019 to the end of January 2021. We utilized a random-effect meta-analytical model to analyze all the data. More in detail, the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was used in order to estimate and evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual activity and functioning. RESULT(S): Twenty-one studies were included in the present study. In total, 2454 women and 3765 men were evaluated. In the present meta-analysis, sexual functioning and activity were assessed by means of two standardized and reliable tools, namely the "Female Sexual Function Index" (FSFI) and the "International Index of Erectile Function-5 items" (IIEF-5). A total of 5 studies reported the FSFI score before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in female participants. Based on the random-effect model, the SMD was computed to be -4.26 [95% confidence interval or CI: -7.26, -1.25], being statistically significant. A total of 3 studies reported the IIEF-5 score before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in male participants. Based on the random-effect model, the SMD was computed to be -0.66 [CI 95%: -0.99, -0.33], being statistically significant. In the majority of these studies, participants reported a reduction in the number of sexual relations and an increase in the frequency of solo sex activity, especially masturbation, compared to the time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): The results of the present study showed that COVID-19 related restrictions were correlated with higher rates of sexual dysfunction and reduced sexual activity; however, results of the current meta-analytical study show that this change in sexual functioning was greater in women compared to men. Sex is one of the dimensions of every person's life; therefore, researchers should identify the factors that lead to sexual dysfunction due to COVID-19 pandemic in their community. In this regard, sexologists should design and implement effective programs to reduce the heterogeneous causes affecting sexual functioning, given the psychological strain that the COVID-19 pandemic puts on individuals.Copyright © 2022.

   volume = {51},
   pages = {441-459},
   abstract = {The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights - as well as the possibility of controlling the system - may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the diversion of health resources away from routine primary care delivery. This disruption of health services has necessitated new approaches to providing care to ensure continuity. Objective(s): To summarize changes to the provision of routine primary care services during the pandemic. Method(s): Rapid literature review using PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane. Eligible studies were based in primary care and described practice-level changes in the provision of routine care in response to COVID-19. Relevant data addressing changes to routine primary care delivery, impact on primary care functions and challenges experienced in adjusting to new approaches to providing care, were obtained from included studies. A narrative summary was guided by Burns et al.'s framework for primary care provision in disasters. Result(s): Seventeen of 1,699 identified papers were included. Studies reported on telehealth use and public health measures to maintain safe access to routine primary care, including providing COVID-19 screening, and establishing dedicated care pathways for non-COVID and COVID-related issues. Acute and urgent care were prioritized, causing disruptions to chronic disease management and preventive care. Challenges included telehealth use including disparities in access and practical difficulties in assessing patients, personal protective equipment shortages, and financial solvency of medical practices. Conclusion(s): Substantial disruptions to routine primary care occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary care practices' rapid adaptation, often with limited resources and support, demonstrates agility and innovative capacity. Findings underscore the need for timely guidance and support from authorities to optimize the provision of comprehensive routine care during pandemics.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19., DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research., SETTING: International studies on incubation period of COVID-19., PARTICIPANTS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies., PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods., RESULTS: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days., CONCLUSIONS: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

To date, empirical evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on TB outcomes has been limited. Here we summarise the evidence available at a country level, identifying broad mechanisms by which COVID-19 may modify TB burden and mitigation efforts. From the data, it is clear that there have been substantial disruptions to TB health services and an increase in vulnerability to TB. Evidence for changes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission is limited, and it remains unclear how the resources required and available for the TB response have changed.

Response to this ongoing pandemic requires extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain its impact and limit further transmission. Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R0 (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following the implementation of various interventions (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the expected disease severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the likely true infection rate is often orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone. In this review, we highlight the critical role played by mathematical modelling to understand COVID-19 thus far, the challenges posed by data availability and uncertainty, and the continuing utility of modelling-based approaches to guide decision making and inform the public health response. +Unless otherwise stated, all bracketed error margins correspond to the 95% credible interval (CrI) for reported estimates.Copyright © 2020},

   abstract = {Background: Transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) remain a major public health problem in developing countries including Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, comprehensive information about sero-epidemiology of major TTIs is lacking at the national level. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed at providing the pooled estimate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis among blood donors in Ethiopia. Method(s): Relevant studies published until May 31, 2019 were searched through PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, HINARI, Cochrane database library, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Google. The methodological quality of articles was assessed using Joanna Brigg's Institute critical appraisal checklist for prevalence and analytical studies. The pooled sero-epidemiology of HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis were determined using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using the I2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's statistics. Result(s): A total of 7921 articles were retrieved, and 7798 were screened for eligibility after duplicates removed. Forty-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; of which 45 were eligible for qualitative and quantitative synthesis: categorized as 36, 34, 31 and 23 studies for estimations of HBV, HIV, HCV and syphilis, respectively. In the random-effects model, the pooled sero-epidemiology of HBV, HIV, HCV and syphilis was 5.20, 2.83, 0.93 and 1.50%, respectively. Moreover, being a male blood donor was significantly associated with HBV and syphilis infection, whereas being a replacement blood donor was significantly associated with a high burden of HIV, HBV and HCV infections. Conclusion(s): The pooled sero-epidemiology of major TTIs among blood donors was high. Therefore, there is a need to design prevention and control strategies in a comprehensive approach to reduce the burden.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   pages = {1800216},
   abstract = {Background: A variety of airline passenger data sources are used for modelling the international spread of infectious diseases. Questions exist regarding the suitability and validity of these sources. Aim(s): We conducted a systematic review to identify the sources of airline passenger data used for these purposes and to assess validation of the data and reproducibility of the methodology. Method(s): Articles matching our search criteria and describing a model of the international spread of human infectious disease, parameterised with airline passenger data, were identified. Information regarding type and source of airline passenger data used was collated and the studies' reproducibility assessed. Result(s): We identified 136 articles. The majority (n = 96) sourced data primarily used by the airline industry. Governmental data sources were used in 30 studies and data published by individual airports in four studies. Validation of passenger data was conducted in only seven studies. No study was found to be fully reproducible, although eight were partially reproducible. Limitation(s): By limiting the articles to international spread, articles focussed on within-country transmission even if they used relevant data sources were excluded. Authors were not contacted to clarify their methods. Searches were limited to articles in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Conclusion(s): We recommend greater efforts to assess validity and biases of airline passenger data used for modelling studies, particularly when model outputs are to inform national and international public health policies. We also recommend improving reporting standards and more detailed studies on biases in commercial and open-access data to assess their reproducibility.Copyright © 2019, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

   abstract = {Currently, efforts have focused on dealing with the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Hopefully, information technology can be applied to meet the challenges related to the pandemic and biosurveillance. Free and open-source software (FOSS) model has emerged as an effective tool against these challenges. The main objective of this study was to determine and summarize the application of FOSS in published and released resources and materials against COVID-19. This review includes projects that were available through GitHub and SourceForge reliable web-based materials. All projects were identified between January 1 and April 10, 2020. Search terms in GitHub and Source Forge were based on clinical terminologies, such as COVID-19, COVID, Covid19, and Corona Virus. Inclusion or exclusion criteria were used to filter the results. Finally, a screening procedure was followed to achieve the most related records. We identified 46,426 records in GitHub and seven projects in Source Forge. The top 40 projects were included. The results show that a high percentage of FOSS projects against COVID-19 were related to visual dashboards. The open dataset and analytical methods made a significant contribution to this context. Previously learned lessons from FOSS have shown that the explained projects would play important roles in future epidemics by forking and joining in new projects, which formed around a specific problem.Copyright © 2021, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

   abstract = {Background: Apart from infecting a large number of people around the world and causing the death of many people, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have changed the healthcare processes of other diseases by changing the allocation of health resources and changing people's access or intention to healthcare systems. Objective(s): To compare the incidence of endpoints marking delayed healthcare seeking in medical emergencies, before and during the pandemic. Method(s): Based on a PICO model, medical emergency conditions that need timely intervention was selected to be evaluated as separate panels. In a systematic literature review, PubMed was quarried for each panel for studies comparing the incidence of various medical emergencies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Markers of failure/disruption of treatment due to delayed referral were included in the meta-analysis for each panel. Result(s): There was a statistically significant increased pooled median time of symptom onset to admission of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients; an increased rate of vasospasm of aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage; and perforation rate in acute appendicitis; diabetic ketoacidosis presentation rate among Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients; and rate of orchiectomy among testicular torsion patients in comparison of pre-COVID-19 with COVID-19 cohorts; while there were no significant changes in the event rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancy and median time of symptom onset to admission in the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) patients. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 has largely disrupted the referral of patients for emergency medical care and patient-related delayed care should be addressed as a major health threat.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

However, a lacking in making a quick reaction to the threat and starting early development of diagnostic sensing tools has had an important impact globally. In this regard, here we will review critically the current developed diagnostic tools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the different types through the discussion of their pros and cons such as nucleic acid detection tests (including PCR and CRISPR), antibody and protein-based diagnosis tests. In addition, potential technologies that are under development such as on-site diagnosis platforms, lateral flow, and portable PCR units are discussed. Data collection and epidemiological analysis could also be an interesting factor to incorporate with the emerging technologies especially with the wide access to smartphones. Lastly, a SWOT analysis and perspectives on how the development of novel sensory platforms should be treated by the different decision-makers are analyzed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Implemented social distancing measures may have forestalled the spread of COVID-19, yet they suppressed the natural human need for contact. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult sexual wellbeing and sexual behavior. An extensive search in Pubmed, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases based on PRISMA guidelines was conducted. After applying specific eligibility criteria, screening resulted in 38 studies. Results were drawn from 31,911 subjects and outlined the negative effect of the pandemic in sexual frequency, function, satisfaction, and the behavioral changes regarding masturbation and internet-based practices. Meta-analyses of the drawn data on 1,343 female, and 1,372 male subjects quantified the degree of sexual function change during the COVID-19 pandemic vs. prior the pandemic. A random effects model revealed the significant negative impact of the pandemic on female sexual function (SMD: 0.76, 95% CI:0.74 to 1.59), while no significant change was found for the males (SMD: 0.25, 95% Cl: -0.03 to 0.52). Significant heterogeneity was identified across included studies (p < 0.00001, I2 = 97%, I2 = 90% for females and males, respectively). As part of the global health, sexual wellbeing should be on the focus of clinicians and researchers.Copyright © 2022 Mourikis, Kokka, Koumantarou-Malisiova, Kontoangelos, Konstantakopoulos and Papageorgiou.},

   abstract = {The emergence of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Wuhan City of China and its rapid shedding among countries, which reminded the history of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) happened almost two decades ago. However, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV shared within few days of outbreak shows the better response of China and the world against the virus, perhaps due to the availability of advanced technology and lesson learned from previous epidemics. The researchers trying to determine the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission of 2019-nCoV. It is believed that disease reporting and data sharing about the emerged Coronavirus with international researchers are important steps to reduce the spread of the virus to the rest of the world. This report is aimed to understand the current status of the 2019-nCoV, problems related to it and possible measures for prevention. The infection may spread through wildlife and asymptomatic patients. People in underdeveloped countries having no basic facilities are at higher risk. Ban on wildlife trade and avoiding unnecessary traveling for a certain period is required to minimize the spread of the disease. The use of face masks, keeping away from the public gathering are other possible means of precautions, capacity building of health workers and provided relevant facilities (equipment, kits, etc.) to underdeveloped countries will further help to contain the pandemic. In the current scenario, it is concluded that 2019-nCoV is spreading irrespective of the borders and become pandemic. Extensive research is a cry of the day to contain the virus and curtail human losses.Copyright © 2020, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Palliative care has been described as 'high touch' rather than 'high tech', which may restrict healthcare workers' enthusiasm in integrating technological advances into the development and refinement of interventions. As a result, the goal of this integrative review was to map and evaluate existing research on the use of telemedicine and telehealth in palliative care patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. This review was guided using the PRISMA Model and CASP guidelines. A total of 17 articles on the use of telehealth in palliative care satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the review. This integrative review provided more evidence for the function and application of telehealth in palliative care. It demonstrated the resiliency of individuals in swiftly adjusting to a new system or application and the adaptability of healthcare systems and providers in establishing an alternate means of providing treatment to patients during a crisis.},

   abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the hospital sector around the world. It has shown the importance of preparing and planning in the future for an outbreak that overwhelms every aspect of a hospital on a rapidly expanding scale. We conducted a scoping review to identify, map, and systemize existing knowledge about the relationships between COVID-19 and hospital infrastructure adaptation and capacity planning worldwide. We searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed and hand-searched gray papers published in English between December 2019 and December 2021. A total of 106 papers were included: 102 empirical studies and four technical reports. Empirical studies entailed five reviews, 40 studies focusing on hospital infrastructure adaptation and planning during the pandemics, and 57 studies on modeling the hospital capacity needed, measured mostly by the number of beds. The majority of studies were conducted in high-income countries and published within the first year of the pandemic. The strategies adopted by hospitals can be classified into short-term (repurposing medical and non-medical buildings, remote adjustments, and establishment of de novo structures) and long-term (architectural and engineering modifications, hospital networks, and digital approaches). More research is needed, focusing on specific strategies and the quality assessment of the evidence.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, COVID-19 modelling efforts faced many challenges, from poor data quality to changing policy and human behaviour. To extract practical insight from the large body of COVID-19 modelling literature available, we provide a narrative review with a systematic approach that quantitatively assessed prospective, data-driven modelling studies of COVID-19 in the USA. We analysed 136 papers, and focused on the aspects of models that are essential for decision makers. We have documented the forecasting window, methodology, prediction target, datasets used, and geographical resolution for each study. We also found that a large fraction of papers did not evaluate performance (25%), express uncertainty (50%), or state limitations (36%). To remedy some of these identified gaps, we recommend the adoption of the EPIFORGE 2020 model reporting guidelines and creating an information-sharing system that is suitable for fast-paced infectious disease outbreak science.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Aim: We aimed to summarise the literature on educational research and training in otorhinolaryngology during the academic year of 2019- 2020. Method(s): A literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase and Cochrane in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for ''(ENT or otorhino* or otolaryngo* or (ear, nose, and throat)) and (educat* or train or training or teach*)''. The search was conducted independently on 13/09/20 by two authors (JOH, JM), any discrepancy was further reviewed by a third author (JC). All original research papers published between 2019- 2020 were included. Result(s): 68 papers were included in our study. Educational research this year shifted focus on how to combat the negative impact of COVID-19 on otorhinolaryngology teaching. Although many of the interventions created for postgraduate and undergraduate education have not been formally assessed, virtual electives for medical students were found to increase interest and knowledge in the specialty. Surgical simulation represented the most common teaching method reported aside from COVID-19. 3D models were used for emergency training with an aim to increase trainee exposure to an anterior neck abscess, retrobulbar haematoma and paediatric tracheostomy. 3D models were positively rated for face and content validity and gave statistically significant improvements in confidence for trainees. Conclusion(s): The otorhinolaryngology training in 2019-2020 has changed massively due to the pandemic. Improving on virtual learning and adapting simulation training are the key to maintain a positive learning environment for medical students and doctors in the short term. Research on the effect of COVID-19 on otorhinolaryngology education and training will be the focus in 2021.},

This is an understudied area., DESIGN: An integrative review using Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model., METHODS: Medical subject heading terms 'Clinical Competence', AND 'High Fidelity Simulation Training', AND 'Clinical Deterioration' were systematically searched in PubMed, CINAHL and Embase databases for peer-reviewed literature published through September 2020. The current study was evaluated using PRISMA checklist., RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Three main concepts were identified: modes of delivery, approach to learner participation and outcome measurement., CONCLUSIONS: This review substantiated the use of high-fidelity simulation to improve acute care nurses' early identification and management of clinical deterioration. Global variations in course design and implementation highlight the need for future approaches to be standardised at the regional level (i.e., country-centric approach) where differing scopes of practice and sociocultural complexities are best contextualised., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings add to the growing body of evidence of simulation science. Important considerations in course planning and design for nursing clinical educators were uncovered. This is especially relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic and urgent need to train redeployed nurses safely and effectively from other units and specialties to acute care.

Hospitals need to plan in advance to ensure that their systems can adapt to a rapidly changing environment if necessary. This review provides an overview of 10 general principles that hospitals and health-care systems should consider when developing disaster plans. The principles are consistent with an "all-hazards" approach to disaster mitigation. This approach is adapted to planning for a multiplicity of threats but emphasizes highly relevant scenarios, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We also describe specific ways these principles helped prepare our hospital for this pandemic. Key points include acting quickly, identifying and engaging key stakeholders early, providing accurate information, prioritizing employee safety and mental health, promoting a fully integrated clinical response, developing surge plans, preparing for ethical dilemmas, and having a cogent exit strategy for post-disaster recovery.Copyright © 2020 American College of Chest Physicians},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The recent COrona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a massive disruption of surgical activity and after a year from its first outbreak surgeons still struggle to keep their regular activity coexisting with the virus exhausting requests of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive overview of the most important recommendations by the International Guidelines about general surgery, and possibly to invite building common shared guidelines to preserve the potential to provide surgical assistance despite the pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were searched. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The searches revealed a total of 18579 articles published up to the end of February 2021. Five articles published between March and May 2020, were included in the present study: Guidelines from The European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES), The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and The European Association for Endoscopic Surgeons (EAES), The Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of Asia (ELSA), The European Hernia Society (EHS) and The International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOS-IBD). CONCLUSION(S): In the likely scenario that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will become an endemic chronic problem, we should not be forced to choose between COVID-19 or surgery in the future and find a way to make both coexisting.},

   abstract = {This systematic review aims to study and classify machine learning models that predict pandemics' evolution within affected regions or countries. The advantage of this systematic review is that it allows the health authorities to decide what prediction model fits best depending upon the region's criticality and optimize hospitals' approaches to preparing and anticipating patient care. We searched ACM Digital Library, Biomed Central, BioRxiv+MedRxiv, BMJ, Computers and Applied Sciences, IEEEXplore, JMIR Medical Informatics, Medline Daily Updates, Nature, Oxford Academic, PubMed, Sage Online, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2022. We divided the interventions into similarities between cumulative COVID-19 real cases and machine learning prediction models' ability to track pandemics trending. We included 45 studies that rated low to high risk of bias. The standardized mean differences (SMD) for the two groups were 0.18, 95% CI, with interval of [0.01, 0.35], I2=0, and p value=0.04. We built a taxonomic analysis of the included studies and determined two domains: pandemics trending prediction models and geolocation tracking models. We performed the meta-analysis and data synthesis and got low publication bias because of missing results. The level of certainty varied from very low to high. By submitting the 45 studies on the risk of bias, the levels of certainty, the summary of findings, and the statistical analysis via the forest and funnel plots assessments, we could determine the satisfactory statistical significance homogeneity across the included studies to simulate the progress of the pandemics and help the healthcare authorities to take preventive decisions.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

   journal = {Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)},
   volume = {9},
   number = {8},
   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze the concept of the "healthcare safety net" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Walker and Avant's process of concept analysis was used in this systematic literature review. The attributes of the concept of a healthcare safety net during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be: (a) capacity, (b) accessibility, (c) health equality, and (d) education. In consideration of these defining criteria, antecedents to the concept were identified as: (a) the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) health inequalities (internal factors and external factors), and (c) healthcare systems (health insurance, screening, protective equipment, medicine, and medical services). Consequences of the concept were: (a) meeting healthcare needs, (b) quality of life, and (c) a decrease in morbidity and mortality. A healthcare safety net is an important concept during the COVID-19 pandemic. In situations like COVID-19, healthcare safety nets are designed to meet safety needs, improve quality of life, and reduce patient turnover and mortality. Based on the results of this study, the development of standardized tools for measuring a healthcare safety net as well as that of policies and systems for resolving a healthcare safety net in the COVID-19 situation is recommended.},

This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of AI and ML when applied to public health interventions to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings showed that quarantine should be the best strategy for containing COVID-19. Nationwide lockdown also showed positive impact, whereas social distancing should be considered to be effective only in com-bination with other interventions including the closure of schools and commercial activities and the limitation of public transportation. Our findings also showed that all the interventions should be initiated early in the pandemic and continued for a sustained period. Despite the study limitation, we concluded that AI and ML could be of help for policy makers to define the strategies for containing the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Introduction: There are barriers to education in both open and laparoscopic hernia repair technique, due to the laparoscopic learning curve, as well as reduced theatre time for junior surgical trainees. This is particularly evident during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Simulation models may provide further opportunities for training in hernia repair outside of the traditional surgical apprenticeship model. Method(s): A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines to identify and evaluate simulation models in hernia repair. Of the 865 records screened, 26 were found to be relevant. These were assessed for face, content, and construct validity, as well as attempts to assess educational impact. Result(s): Simulation models were identified comprising of animal tissues, synthetic materials, as well as VR technology. Models were designed for instruction in repair of inguinal, umbilical, incisional and diaphragmatic hernias. 4 of the 21 laparoscopic hernia repair models described demonstrated validity across several domains, and 3 of these 4 models were part of simulation-based courses demonstrating transferability of skills learnt in simulation to the operating room. Of the 5 open hernia repair simulation models, none were found to have demonstrated an educational impact in addition to assessing validity. Conclusion(s): Few models individually were able to demonstrate validity and educational impact. Several novel assessment tools have been developed for assessment of progress when performing simulated and real laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The disruption of health services due to coronavirus disease (COVID) is expected to dramatically alter cancer care; however, the implications for care quality and outcomes remain poorly understood., OBJECTIVE: We undertook a scoping review to evaluate what is known in the literature about how cancer treatment has been modified as a result of the COVID pandemic in patients receiving treatment for solid tumours, and what domains of quality of care are most impacted., METHODS: Citations were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 1 January 2019 to 28 October 2020), utilizing search terms grouped by the key concept (oncology, treatment, treatment modifications and COVID). Articles were excluded if they dealt exclusively with management of COVID-positive patients, modifications to cancer screening, diagnosis or supportive care or were not in English. Articles reporting on guidelines, consensus statements, recommendations, literature reviews, simulations or predictive models, or opinions in the absence of accompanying information on experience with treatment modifications in practice were excluded. Treatment modifications derived from the literature were stratified by modality (surgery, systemic therapy (ST) and radiotherapy) and thematically grouped. To understand what areas of quality were most impacted, modifications were mapped against the Institute of Medicine's quality domains. Where reported, barriers and facilitators were abstracted and thematically grouped to understand drivers of treatment modifications. Findings were synthesized into a logic model to conceptualize the inter-relationships between different modifications, as well as their downstream impacts on outcomes., RESULTS: In the 87 retained articles, reductions in outpatients visits (26.4%) and delays/deferrals were commonly reported across all treatment modalities (surgery: 50%; ST: 55.8% and radiotherapy: 56.7%), as were reductions in surgical capacity (57.1%), alternate systemic regimens with longer treatment intervals or use of oral agents (19.2%) and the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens (40.0%). Delivery of effective, timely and equitable care was the quality domains found to be the most impacted. The most commonly reported facilitator of maintaining cancer care delivery levels was the shift to virtual models of care (62.1%), while patient-initiated deferrals and cancellations (34.8%), often due to fear of contracting COVID (60.9%), was a commonly reported barrier., CONCLUSIONS: As it will take a considerable amount of time for the cancer system to resume capacity and adjust models of care in response to the pandemic, these treatment delays and modifications will likely be prolonged and will negatively impact the quality of care and patient outcomes.

   journal = {Frontiers in epidemiology},
   volume = {2},
   pages = {899589},
   abstract = {Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has boosted the appearance of clinical predictions models in medical literature. Many of these models aim to provide guidance for decision making on treatment initiation. Special consideration on how to account for post-baseline treatments is needed when developing such models. We examined how post-baseline treatment was handled in published Covid-19 clinical prediction models and we illustrated how much estimated risks may differ according to how treatment is handled., Methods: Firstly, we reviewed 33 Covid-19 prognostic models published in literature in the period up to 5 May 2020. We extracted: (1) the reported intended use of the model; (2) how treatment was incorporated during model development and (3) whether the chosen analysis strategy was in agreement with the intended use. Secondly, we used nationwide Dutch data on hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 to illustrate how estimated mortality risks will differ when using four different analysis strategies to model ICU treatment., Results: Of the 33 papers, 21 (64%) had misalignment between intended use and analysis strategy, 7 (21%) were unclear about the estimated risk and only 5 (15%) had clear alignment between intended use and analysis strategy. We showed with real data how different approaches to post-baseline treatment yield different estimated mortality risks, ranging between 33 and 46% for a 75 year-old patient with two medical conditions., Conclusions: Misalignment between intended use and analysis strategy is common in reported Covid-19 clinical prediction models. This can lead to considerable under or overestimation of intended risks. Copyright © 2022 Prosepe, Groenwold, Knevel, Pajouheshnia and van Geloven.},

   volume = {143},
   pages = {104422},
   abstract = {Objectives: To examine recent literature in order to present a comprehensive overview of the current trends as regards the computational models used to represent the propagation of an infectious outbreak in a population, paying particular attention to those that represent network-based transmission. Method(s): a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Papers published in English between 2010 and September 2021 were sought in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed and Scopus databases. Result(s): Upon considering their titles and abstracts, 832 papers were obtained, of which 192 were selected for a full content-body check. Of these, 112 studies were eventually deemed suitable for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Emphasis was placed on the spatial and temporal scales studied, the use of networks or graphs, and the granularity of the data used to evaluate the models. The models principally used to represent the spreading of outbreaks have been stochastic (55.36%), while the type of networks most frequently used are relationship networks (32.14%). The most common spatial dimension used is a region (19.64%) and the most used unit of time is a day (28.57%). Synthetic data as opposed to an external source were used in 51.79% of the papers. With regard to the granularity of the data sources, aggregated data such as censuses or transportation surveys are the most common. Conclusion(s): We identified a growing interest in the use of networks to represent disease transmission. We detected that research is focused on only certain combinations of the computational model, type of network (in both the expressive and the structural sense) and spatial scale, while the search for other interesting combinations has been left for the future.Copyright © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {Background: Economic evaluation of the testing strategies to control transmission and monitor the severity of COVID-19 after the pandemic is essential. This study aimed to review the economic evaluation of COVID-19 tests and to construct a model with outcomes in terms of cost and test acceptability for surveillance in the post-pandemic period in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. Material/Methods: We performed the systematic review following PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We included the relevant studies that reported the economic evaluation of COVID-19 tests for surveillance. Also, we input current probability, sensitivity, and specificity for COVID-19 surveillance in the post-pandemic period., Results: A total of 104 articles met the eligibility criteria, and 8 articles were reviewed and assessed for quality. The specificity and sensitivity of COVID-19 screening tests were reported as 80% to 90% and 40% to 90%, respectively. The target population presented a mortality rate between 0.2% and 19.2% in the post-pandemic period. The implementation model of COVID-19 screening tests for surveillance with a cost mean for molecular and antigen tests was US$ 46.64 (min-max US $0.25-$105.39) and US $6.15 (min-max US $2-$10), respectively. Conclusion(s): For the allocation budget for the COVID-19 surveillance test, it is essential to consider the incidence and mortality of the post-pandemic period in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. A robust method to evaluate outcomes is needed to prevent increasing COVID-19 incidents earlier.Copyright © 2024 International Scientific Information, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Objective(s): To analyze the impact of the telemedicine measures implemented during the COVID-19 period on chronic patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic review was carried out using the following databases: PubMed, Pro-Quest, and Scopus. The systematic review followed the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The search equation utilized descriptors sourced from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus. The search equation was: "hypertension AND older AND primary care AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus)" and its Spanish equivalent. Result(s): The following data were obtained: 14 articles provided data on 6,109,628 patients and another 4 articles focused on a study population of 9684 physicians. Telemedicine was less likely to be used by elderly patients (OR 0.85; 95% C.I. 0.83-0.88; p = 0.05), those of Asian race (OR 0.69; 95% C.I. 0.66-0.73; p = 0.05), and those whose native language was not English (OR 0.89; 95% C.I. 0.78-0.9; p = 0.05). In primary care, lower use of telemedicine was associated with residents of rural areas (OR 0.81; p = 0.05), patients of African American race (OR 0.65, p = 0.05), and others (OR 0.64; p = 0.05). A high proportion (40%) of physicians had no prior training in telemedicine techniques. The highest quality in terms of telephone consultation was significantly associated with physicians who did not increase their prescription of antibiotherapy during the pandemic (OR = 0.30, p = 0.05) or prescribe more tests (OR 0.06 p = 0.05), i.e., who maintained their former clinical criteria despite COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Telemedicine is of proven value and has been especially useful in the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed remote-presential model is most efficient. Appropriate training in this area for physicians and patients, together with correct provision, is essential to prevent errors in implementation and use.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and duty hour restrictions have illuminated a role for surgical simulation in trainees that permits meaningful technical experience outside the operating room. There is a need for the implementation of surgical simulation infrastructure adjacent to clinical training with practical considerations for complexity and cost. This systematic review analyzes surgical simulations that train hand surgical techniques and procedures with subjective or objective competency assessment. Method(s): A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA- P guidelines using the PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Selected search terms included procedures relevant to the field of hand surgery and various types of simulation training. Data, including skills and techniques taught and assessed, model type, equipment, cost, and emphasis placed in training for each article, were extracted. Result(s): Of 2,519 articles, 40 met inclusion criteria. Models were described as: synthetic benchtop/3D-printed (40.0%), animal (22.5%), cadaveric (20.0%), augmented and virtual reality (AR/ VR; 12.5%), and other computer simulation (12.5%). Three models incorporated both a physical benchtop component and an AR/ VR component. The procedures most represented included tendon repair (30.0%), fracture fixation (27.5%), wrist arthroscopy (15.0%), and carpal tunnel release (15.0%). Sixty-five percent of articles emphasized the importance of surgical simulation in a surgeon's training. Conclusion(s): A diversity of surgical simulation models exist for the practice of various aspects of hand surgery. The existing literature demonstrates their utility for increasing expertise with surgical techniques and procedures in a low-risk setting.},

   abstract = {Introduction. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which required urgent responses from health systems, and ongoing decision making in a context of limited and evolving evidence, modeling played a significant role in supporting public policy making. Nonetheless, particularly in low and middle-income countries, modeling groups are scarce, and usually not routinely involved in supporting public health policy making. We aimed to appraise COVID-19 modeling work in Brazil during the pandemic. Methods. We performed a scoping review following PRISMA guidelines to identify groups conducting COVID-19 modeling to support health decision-making in Brazil. Search strategies were applied to MEDLINE, LILACS, Embase, ArXiv, and also included National data repositories and gray literature. We excluded reports of models without modeling results. Titles, abstracts, data repository descriptions and full-text articles identified were read and selected by two reviewers. Data extracted included modeling questions, model characteristics (structure, type, and programming), epidemiologic data sources, main outcomes reported, and parameters. To further identify modeling groups that might have not yet published results, snowball sampling was performed, and a short survey was sent electronically. Investigators and policymakers were invited to an online interview, to obtain further information on how they interacted, communicated, and used modeling results. Results. We retrieved 1,061 references. After removing duplicates (127), 1,016 abstracts and titles were screened. From an initial selection of 142 abstracts, 133 research groups were identified, of which 67 didn't meet the eligibility criteria. Of these, 66 groups were invited for an interview, of which 24 were available, including 18 modeling groups from academic institutions, and four groups from State Health departments. Most models assessed the impact of mitigation measures in cases/hospitalization/deaths and healthcare service demand. Interaction and communication with decisionmakers were not well established in most groups. Conclusions. Despite a large number of modeling groups in Brazil, we observed a significant gap in modeling demand and communicating its results to support the decision-making process during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   pages = {S191-S192},
   abstract = {Background -Healthcare systems have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. The COVID-19 pandemic specifically has disrupted the traditional healthcare delivery model. New methods of care are needed that can be delivered safely and that complement and improve the way treatment is provided in and out of the doctor's office. Technological interventions used to treat illnesses and promote health are grouped under the umbrella term of digital therapeutics. The use of digital therapeutics is becoming increasingly common in the field of mental health. Although there are many technologies currently being implemented, the research supporting their usability, efficacy and risk requires further examination, especially those interventions that can be used independently and without support. Objective - This review aims to identify evidence-based, self-directed virtual methods of care that could be used in adult patients after discharge from mental health services and have been evaluated with objective (in terms of improving health outcomes) and subjective measures (acceptability and usability). Methods - A systematic review was conducted broadly following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)/Prospero guidelines in 3 databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Ovid. We enforced strict criteria, all interventions reviewed had to be automated with no human input required (either at the patient's or the technology's end), so patients could implement them independently without any support from a healthcare professional or technical staff. Inclusion criteria were self-directed, automated, technology-based interventions related to mental health, for adults and with a solid evaluation process. Results - Thirty-four papers were identified that fit the inclusion criteria: 24 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), 9 non-RCT quantitative studies and 1 qualitative study. Technologies employed included websites, automated text messaging, phone applications, videos, computer software and integrated voice response. Twenty studies focused on Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (iCBTs) as a therapeutic paradigm compared to waitlist, on- line human delivered therapy and other interventions. Fourteen studies used paradigms other than iCBT. Out of eight studies directly comparing directly guided to unguided digital care, three studies showed no differences, three favored guided interventions and two favored unguided interventions. Research showed dropout rates as high as 80% in unguided interventions citing potential problems with acceptability of the suggested technologies. Conclusions - The use of virtual interventions in healthcare is increasing, but there seems to be a lack of research on efficacy and limited information over what types of interventions are most suitable for mental health care. Current research suggests an effectiveness of virtual care interventions that is superior to waitlist controls. However, to show effectiveness over traditional psychiatric care studies should use comparison groups that are comparable to the intervention studied avoiding waiting list or other non-intervention arms. One of the main advantages of digital therapeutics is that these interventions will also become accessible to people who do not have access to healthcare, such as patients who live far from healthcare centres, cannot travel because of disability or family commitments or cannot afford traditional care. In this way, self-directed digital therapeutics can contribute to healthcare equity. No conflict of interestCopyright © 2021},

   abstract = {Introduction: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) have had an increased risk of developing health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to physical illness, they have experienced mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic via an umbrella review and meta-analysis. Method(s): This study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline to perform a systematic literature search using various medical databases (Web of science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Embase, and Google scholar). The search included all articles published through the first of January 2020 the end of March 2021. The systematic review and meta-analysis studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD among health care workers were included in the study, and studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD in normal people or other epidemics were excluded. The random effects model was used to perform a meta-analysis, and the I2 index was used to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. Data was analyzed using STATA (version 14) software. Result(s): The initial literature search yielded 145 studies. After excluding duplicates and assessing the quality of the studies, 7 studies were selected for meta-analysis. The results showed that the overall prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic was 13.52% (95% CI: 9.06-17.98, I2 = 65.5%, p = 0.008). Conclusion(s): There is a high prevalence of PTSD among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to invest in efforts to screen HCWs for mental health disorders such as PTSD and provide them with mental health support.Copyright © 2021 Sahebi, Yousefi, Abdi, Jamshidbeigi, Moayedi, Torres, Wesemann, Sheikhbardsiri and Golitaleb.},

   abstract = {Background: The ability to proactively predict the epidemiological dynamics of infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would facilitate efficient public health responses and may help guide patient management. Viral loads of infected people correlate with infectiousness and, therefore, could be used to predict future case rates. Aim(s): In this systematic review, we determine whether there is a correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load) and epidemiological trends in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and whether Ct values are predictive of future cases. Method(s): A PubMed search was conducted on August 22 2022, based on a search strategy of studies reporting correlations between SARS-CoV-2 Ct values and epidemiological trends. Result(s): Data from 16 studies were relevant for inclusion. RT-PCR Ct values were measured from national (n = 3), local (n = 7), single-unit (n = 5), or closed single-unit (n = 1) samples. All studies retrospectively examined the correlation between Ct values and epidemiological trends, and seven evaluated their prediction model prospectively. Five studies used the temporal reproduction number (Rt) as the measure of the population/epidemic growth rate. Eight studies reported a prediction time in the negative cross-correlation between Ct values and new daily cases, with seven reporting a prediction time of ~1-3 weeks, and one reporting 33 days. Conclusion(s): Ct values are negatively correlated with epidemiological trends and may be useful in predicting subsequent peaks in variant waves of COVID-19 and other circulating pathogens.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has been declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization due to its rapid spread. Since the first case was identified in Wuhan, China, the battle against this deadly disease started and has disrupted almost every field of life. Medical staff and laboratories are leading from the front, but researchers from various fields and governmental agencies have also proposed healthy ideas to protect each other. In this article, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented to highlight the latest developments in analyzing the COVID-19 data using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The number of studies related to Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and mathematical models discussed in this research has shown a significant impact on forecasting and the spread of COVID-19. The results and discussion presented in this study are based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Out of 218 articles selected at the first stage, 57 met the criteria and were included in the review process. The findings are therefore associated with those 57 studies, which recorded that CNN (DL) and SVM (ML) are the most used algorithms for forecasting, classification, and automatic detection. The importance of the compartmental models discussed is that the models are useful for measuring the epidemiological features of COVID-19. Current findings suggest that it will take around 1.7 to 140 days for the epidemic to double in size based on the selected studies. The 12 estimates for the basic reproduction range from 0 to 7.1. The main purpose of this research is to illustrate the use of ML, DL, and mathematical models that can be helpful for the researchers to generate valuable solutions for higher authorities and the healthcare industry to reduce the impact of this epidemic.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Objectives Our study described how the WHO intra-action review (IAR) methodology was operationalised and customised in three Western Balkan countries and territories and the Republic of Moldova and analysed the common key findings to inform analyses of the lessons learnt from the pandemic response. Design We extracted data from the respective IAR reports and performed a qualitative thematic content analysis to identify common (between countries and territories) and cross-cutting (across the response pillars) themes on best practices, challenges and priority actions. The analysis involved three stages, namely: extraction of data, initial identification of emerging themes and review and definition of the themes. Setting IARs were conducted in the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Kosovo and the Republic of North Macedonia between December 2020 and November 2021. The IARs were conducted at different time points relative to the respective pandemic trajectories (14-day incidence rate ranging from 23 to 495 per 100 000). Results Case management was reviewed in all the IARs, while the infection prevention and control, surveillance and country-level coordination pillars were reviewed in three countries. The thematic content analysis identified four common and cross-cutting best practices, seven challenges and six priority recommendations. Recommendations included investing in sustainable human resources and technical capacities developed during the pandemic, providing continuous capacity-building and training (with regular simulation exercises), updating legislation, improving communication between healthcare providers at all levels of healthcare and enhancing digitalisation of health information systems. Conclusions The IARs provided an opportunity for continuous collective reflection and learning with multisectoral engagement. They also offered an opportunity to review public health emergency preparedness and response functions in general, thereby contributing to generic health systems strengthening and resilience beyond COVID-19. However, success in strengthening the response and preparedness requires leadership and resource allocation, prioritisation and commitment by the countries and territories themselves.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

   abstract = {Heart Failure (HF), a common chronic disease, requires multidisciplinary care to optimise outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on people's movement and access to health services, introduced severe challenges to chronic disease management. The era that will evolve after this pandemic is likely to provide uncertainty and service model disruptions. HF treatment is based on guidelines derived from randomised clinical trial evidence. Translational shortfalls from trials into practice have been overcome with post-trial service improvement studies like OPTIMIZE-HF where a team using a process of care can translate evidence to the general population. However, gaps remain for vulnerable populations e.g. those with more severe HF, with multiple comorbid conditions, and certain demographic groups and/or residents in remote locations. Health technology has come with great promise, to fill some of these gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to observe, from Australian healthcare lens, HF management outside the traditional model of care. This narrative review describes relatively recent events with health technology as a solution to improve on service gaps.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by IMR Press.},

   title = {Digital dashboards visualizing public health data: a systematic review},
   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {11},
   pages = {999958},
   abstract = {Introduction: Public health is not only threatened by diseases, pandemics, or epidemics. It is also challenged by deficits in the communication of health information. The current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that impressively. One way to deliver scientific data such as epidemiological findings and forecasts on disease spread are dashboards. Considering the current relevance of dashboards for public risk and crisis communication, this systematic review examines the state of research on dashboards in the context of public health risks and diseases., Method: Nine electronic databases where searched for peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings. Included articles (n = 65) were screened and assessed by three independent reviewers. Through a methodological informed differentiation between descriptive studies and user studies, the review also assessed the quality of included user studies (n = 18) by use of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT)., Results: 65 articles were assessed in regards to the public health issues addressed by the respective dashboards, as well as the data sources, functions and information visualizations employed by the different dashboards. Furthermore, the literature review sheds light on public health challenges and objectives and analyzes the extent to which user needs play a role in the development and evaluation of a dashboard. Overall, the literature review shows that studies that do not only describe the construction of a specific dashboard, but also evaluate its content in terms of different risk communication models or constructs (e.g., risk perception or health literacy) are comparatively rare. Furthermore, while some of the studies evaluate usability and corresponding metrics from the perspective of potential users, many of the studies are limited to a purely functionalistic evaluation of the dashboard by the respective development teams., Conclusion: The results suggest that applied research on public health intervention tools like dashboards would gain in complexity through a theory-based integration of user-specific risk information needs., Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=200178, identifier: CRD42020200178.

   title = {Appealing to Tacit Knowledge and Axiology to Enhance Medical Practice in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Hermeneutic Bioethical Analysis},
   journal = {Frontiers in public health},

   abstract = {Background: The pressure of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, epidemiological and demographic changes, personnel-patient relationship in healthcare, and the development of biotechnologies do not go unnoticed by the healthcare professional. Changes are so wide and at a high rate that guidelines and mere scientific knowledge, which are represented by evidence-based medicine, are not sufficient to lead actions, thus the experiential aspects in the configuration of an ethos present as a fundamental part of the resources to deal with critical scenarios, such as a pandemic. In this regard, the recognition of tacit knowledge as a way of teaching and learning skills related to ethical aspects such as principles, virtues, and values, revealed as a fundamental part of the clinical field. The challenge is to strengthen binomial evidence-based medicine and values-based in order to achieve excellence in the health care of the patients and the well-being of the clinical personnel. Method(s): A 2-fold analysis was conducted taking pediatric endocrinology as an example. First, a systematic review was carried out in electronic databases BIREME, PubMed, and PhilPapers following PEO and PRISMA approaches. A total of 132 articles were garnered. After reading their title and abstract, 30 articles were obtained. Quantitative information was arranged in an Excel database according to three themes: ethics, axiology, and tacit knowledge. A quality criterion that meets our research question was assigned to each article and those which had a quality criterion of 3 (9) were taken to carry out the hermeneutic bioethical analysis, which consisted of three stages, namely naive reading, codification, and interpretation. The results were analyzed in Atlas.ti. to elucidate the relations between the three main themes in accordance with the objective. Result(s): Although there was no difference in the frequency of tacit knowledge skills, including cognitive, social, and technical, for medical practice, there is an intrinsic relationship between epistemic and ethical values with cognitive skills, this means that professionals who practice honesty, authenticity and self-control are capable of seeing patients as persons and thus respect their dignity. This suggested that there is a strong partnership between evidence-based medicine and value-based medicine, which reinforced this binomial as the two feet on which medical practice decisions rested. With regard to tacit knowledge in terms of the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges refer to (1) adapting and learning a new way of establishing trust with the patient and (2) how to capitalize on the new knowledge that new experiences have posed. Discussion(s): The analysis of ethical-tacit knowledge in medicine is a recent phenomenon and is in full development. Although no references were found that dealt with any of the main topics in pediatric endocrinology, there is an interest in pediatrics to explore and discuss educational strategies in ethics related to its tacit dimension as a vector of enhancement in the clinical practice. Educational strategies ought to take into consideration the development of skills that promote reflection and discussion of experiences, even more vigorously in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021 Serrano-Zamago and Altamirano-Bustamante.},

   abstract = {Successful detection of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater suggests the potential utility of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 community surveillance. This systematic review aims to assess the performance of wastewater surveillance as early warning system of COVID-19 community transmission. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase and the WBE Consortium Registry according to PRISMA guidelines for relevant articles published until 31st July 2021. Relevant data were extracted and summarized. Quality of each paper was assessed using an assessment tool adapted from Bilotta et al.'s tool for environmental science. Of 763 studies identified, 92 studies distributed across 34 countries were shortlisted for qualitative synthesis. A total of 26,197 samples were collected between January 2020 and May 2021 from various locations serving population ranging from 321 to 11,400,000 inhabitants. Overall sample positivity was moderate at 29.2% in all examined settings with the spike (S) gene having maximum rate of positive detections and nucleocapsid (N) gene being the most targeted. Wastewater signals preceded confirmed cases by up to 63 days, with 13 studies reporting sample positivity before the first cases were detected in the community. At least 50 studies reported an association of viral load with community cases. While wastewater surveillance cannot replace large-scale diagnostic testing, it can complement clinical surveillance by providing early signs of potential transmission for more active public health responses. However, more studies using standardized and validated methods are required along with risk analysis and modelling to understand the dynamics of viral outbreaks.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   pages = {26-39},
   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to more virtual simulation training. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of virtual simulations and their design features in developing clinical reasoning skills among nurses and nursing students., Method: A systematic search in CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ProQuest, PsycINFO, and Scopus was conducted. The PRISMA guidelines, Cochrane's risk of bias, and GRADE was used to assess the articles. Meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regression were performed., Results: The search retrieved 11,105 articles, and 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in clinical reasoning based on applied knowledge and clinical performance among learners in the virtual simulation group compared with the control group. Meta-regression did not identify any significant covariates. Subgroup analyses revealed that virtual simulations with patient management contents, using multiple scenarios with nonimmersive experiences, conducted more than 30-minutes and postscenario feedback were more effective., Conclusions: Virtual simulations can improve clinical reasoning skill. This study may inform nurse educators on how virtual simulation should be designed to optimize the development of clinical reasoning.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the cornerstone of infectious disease outbreak response in the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions. Outbreak strategies often involve combinations of NPIs that may change according to disease prevalence and population response. Little is known with regard to how costly each NPI is to implement. This information is essential to inform policy decisions for outbreak response., OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in existing literature, we conducted a systematic review on outbreak costings and simulation studies related to a number of NPI strategies, including isolating infected individuals, contact tracing and quarantine, and school closures., METHODS: Our search covered the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, studies published between 1990 and 24 March 2020 were included. We included studies containing cost data for our NPIs of interest in pandemic, epidemic, and outbreak response scenarios., RESULTS: We identified 61 relevant studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the cost components recorded for NPIs in outbreak costing studies. The direct costs of NPIs for which costing studies existed also ranged widely: isolating infected individuals per case: US$141.18 to US$1042.68 (2020 values), tracing and quarantine of contacts per contact: US$40.73 to US$93.59, social distancing: US$33.76 to US$167.92, personal protection and hygiene: US$0.15 to US$895.60., CONCLUSION: While there are gaps and heterogeneity in available cost data, the findings of this review and the collated cost database serve as an important resource for evidence-based decision-making for estimating costs pertaining to NPI implementation in future outbreak response policies.

   abstract = {Mathematical models are increasingly used throughout infectious disease outbreaks to guide control measures. In this review article, we focus on the initial stages of an outbreak, when a pathogen has just been observed in a new location (e.g., a town, region or country). We provide a beginner's guide to two methods for estimating the risk that introduced cases lead to sustained local transmission (i.e., the probability of a major outbreak), as opposed to the outbreak fading out with only a small number of cases. We discuss how these simple methods can be extended for epidemiological models with any level of complexity, facilitating their wider use, and describe how estimates of the probability of a major outbreak can be used to guide pathogen surveillance and control strategies. We also give an overview of previous applications of these approaches. This guide is intended to help quantitative researchers develop their own epidemiological models and use them to estimate the risks associated with pathogens arriving in new host populations. The development of these models is crucial for future outbreak preparedness.

   abstract = {PURPOSE of reviewMathematical, statistical, and computational models provide insight into the transmission mechanisms and optimal control of healthcare-associated infections. To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings.Recent findingsThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts.SummaryAs the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations. However, with effective communication of findings and interdisciplinary collaboration, opportunities for implementing models for clinical decision-making and public health decision-making are bound to increase.

   abstract = {Importance: Approximately 5% to 15% of patients with COVID-19 require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and, at times, tracheostomy. Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective(s): To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources: EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Result(s): Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

   pages = {CD015085},
   abstract = {Background: Starting in late 2019, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, spread around the world. Long-term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. Objective(s): To assess the effects of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. Search Method(s): On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews. Selection Criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long-term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long-term care facilities, and adverse health effects. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS-I tool for cohort and interrupted-time-series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case-control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. Main Result(s): We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. Most studies compared outcomes in long-term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)Self-confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. Contact-regulating and transmission-reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is uncle r how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact -regulating and transmission -reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom-based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)Separating infected and non-infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)A combination of multiple infection-control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Authors' conclusions: This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities. These may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future.Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

   abstract = {With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, simulation modelling approaches have become effective tools to simulate the potential effects of different intervention measures and predict the dynamic COVID-19 trends. In this scoping review, Studies published between February 2020 and May 2022 that investigated the spread of COVID-19 using four common simulation modeling methods were systematically reported and summarized. Publication trend, characteristics, software, and code availability of included articles were analyzed. Among the included 340 studies, most articles used agent-based model (ABM; n = 258; 75.9 %), followed by the models of system dynamics (n = 42; 12.4 %), discrete event simulation (n = 25; 7.4 %), and hybrid simulation (n = 15; 4.4 %). Furthermore, our review emphasized the purposes and sample time period of included articles. We classified the purpose of the 340 included studies into five categories, most studies mainly analyzed the spread of COVID-19 under policy interventions. For the sample time period analysis, most included studies analyzed the COVID-19 spread in the second wave.

   abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a valuable tool that could be widely used to inform clinical and public health decision-making to effectively manage the impacts of a pandemic. The objective of this scoping review was to identify the key use cases for involving AI for pandemic preparedness and response from the peer-reviewed, preprint, and grey literature. The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions; surveillance and outbreak detection; real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations; real-time detection of influenza-like illness; triage and timely diagnosis of infections; and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic. These findings can support policymakers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in prioritizing research and development to support operationalization of AI for future pandemics.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Multi-compartment models have been playing a central role in modelling infectious disease dynamics since the early 20th century. They are a class of mathematical models widely used for describing the mechanism of an evolving epidemic. Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. r software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper. Copyright © 2020 International Statistical Institute.},

Paying attention to ART adherence requires a system thinking with the life-long factors, individual-environment interactions and contextualized dynamics. Although several quantitative research had been conducted, they were not able to fully demonstrate the development of research approaches and scopes of previous studies. Essential and practical public health policy should be based on the most accessible and strategically analyzed evidence. Therefore, our study uses a scientometric approach to supplement previous reviews research covering until the end of 2017. Using a combination of two quantitative approaches to supplement previous reviews, we attempt to identify the research trends and potential research gaps which could be very helpful for policies and practices enhancements to inform evidence-based strategies. Our result indicates countries tend to collaborate in traditional models rather than prioritize severity and characteristics of HIV epidemics. Further ART research should highlight the incorporation of newly developed technology to examine long-term impacts, combine multiple measures, address contextual factors, and involve available technologies and resources, e.g., family, community.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

   abstract = {In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2-4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

   pages = {S81},
   abstract = {Introduction. Constantly rising costs of pharmaceuticals and biologics spurred a debate in recent years leading to increasingly persistent public calls to overhaul the existing system of pricing and distributing health technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the controversies of the current model of access to health commodities in all evidence when the existing discrepancy between the global supply and the global demand in health technology can be viewed as an illustration of a conflict between the neoliberal free market ideal of health innovation genesis and ownership and the original democratic principles of what would now be called sustainable human development. Methods. Presented here is an integrative literature review of over 265 publications in peer-reviewed journals on Pubmed and Web of Science, academic and grey literature, mainly publicism, published in English. We reviewed and analyzed included literature for the purposes of identifying leading ideas with regards to ethical frameworks for evaluating or referencing value for pricing health commodities. Results. Seven drug pricing models were analyzed in terms of them satisfying the three most common criteria of price adequacy - its fairness (viewed from the point of view of main schools of ethical thought), accountability-for-reasonableness (including transparency of decisions, relevance, existing mechanisms of revisions and governance to ensure compliance), and price functionality. One of the central ideas under controversy is value, its relative character for different contexts due to the high weight of the willingness-to-pay in the value-based health technology assessment (HTA) decisions and the relative value of money, and the attempts to quantify value in a universal way for institutions, patients, and originators. Conclusions. While the review scored the pricing models on their public fairness with volume-based rather than value-based pricing models leading the rating, the main conclusion of the review is that the main meaningful divide is between value creation and value extraction when pricing health innovation.},

   abstract = {The unprecedented outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously affected numerous countries in the world from various aspects such as education, economy, social security, public health, etc. Most governments have made great efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g., locking down hard-hit cities and advocating masks for the population. However, some countries and regions have relatively poor medical conditions in terms of insufficient medical equipment, hospital capacity overload, personnel shortage, and other problems, resulting in the large-scale spread of the epidemic. With the unique advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it plays an extremely important role in medical imaging, clinical data, drug development, epidemic prediction, and telemedicine. Therefore, AI is a powerful tool that can help humans solve complex problems, especially in the fight against COVID-19. This study aims to analyze past research results and interpret the role of Artificial Intelligence in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from five aspects. In this paper, we also discuss the future development directions in different fields and prove the validity of the models through experiments, which will help researchers develop more efficient models to control the spread of COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Jia, Li, Duan, Tao and Zhao.},

   journal = {Frontiers in public health},
   volume = {10},
   pages = {1033432},
   abstract = {The COVID-19 epidemic has caused more than 6.4 million deaths to date and has become a hot topic of interest in different disciplines. According to bibliometric analysis, more than 340,000 articles have been published on the COVID-19 epidemic from the beginning of the epidemic until recently. Modeling infectious diseases can provide critical planning and analytical tools for outbreak control and public health research, especially from a spatio-temporal perspective. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of the developing process of spatio-temporal dynamic models. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of these spatio-temporal dynamic models for dealing with COVID-19, focusing on the different model scales. We first summarized several data used in the spatio-temporal modeling of the COVID-19, and then, through literature review and summary, we found that the existing COVID-19 spatio-temporal models can be divided into two categories: macro-dynamic models and micro-dynamic models. Typical representatives of these two types of models are compartmental and metapopulation models, cellular automata (CA), and agent-based models (ABM). Our results show that the modeling results are not accurate enough due to the unavailability of the fine-grained dataset of COVID-19. Furthermore, although many models have been developed, many of them focus on short-term prediction of disease outbreaks and lack medium- and long-term predictions. Therefore, future research needs to integrate macroscopic and microscopic models to build adaptive spatio-temporal dynamic simulation models for the medium and long term (from months to years) and to make sound inferences and recommendations about epidemic development in the context of medical discoveries, which will be the next phase of new challenges and trends to be addressed. In addition, there is still a gap in research on collecting fine-grained spatial-temporal big data based on cloud platforms and crowdsourcing technologies to establishing world model to battle the epidemic.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zheng and Liu.},

   journal = {Public Health Nursing},
   volume = {40},
   number = {1},
   pages = {208-217},
   abstract = {Background: Social distance practices are crucial for outpatient clinics during disease outbreaks and are an effective preventive measure for reducing influenza transmission during such pandemics in people with poor health. Method(s): This study applies an evidence-based practice (EBP) approach to confirm the effectiveness of social distancing in healthy individuals during an influenza pandemic and employs the induced ordered weighted averaging model to confirm the effectiveness of EBP. The study design, validity, reliability, results, and generalizability focused on discussing three systematic reviews and two cohort studies via the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). First, by introducing the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) question; second, by establishing the five steps of EBP; third, by utilizing the CASP checklist for the appraisal; and finally, by presenting a conclusion. Result(s): According to the hierarchy of evidence, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses retrieved five articles for addressing the PICO question. All the evidence demonstrates that social distancing is valuable during influenza pandemics among non-infected individuals. Precise, timely, and robust social distancing implementation can reduce the spread of infection, delay the epidemic peak, and ease the pressure on healthcare resources. Gatekeepers are responsible for guiding individuals through the implementation process for reducing influenza transmission, particularly in densely populated areas. Conclusion(s): Social distance is crucial for outpatient clinics during an epidemic and effectively reduces the spread of infection, delay epidemic peaks, and eases pressure on healthcare resources.Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted research interests from all fields. Phylogenetic and social network analyses based on connectivity between either COVID-19 patients or geographic regions and similarity between syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences provide unique angles to answer public health and pharmaco-biological questions such as relationships between various SARS-CoV-2 mutants, the transmission pathways in a community and the effectiveness of prevention policies. This paper serves as a systematic review of current phylogenetic and social network analyses with applications in COVID-19 research. Challenges in current phylogenetic network analysis on SARS-CoV-2 such as unreliable inferences, sampling bias and batch effects are discussed as well as potential solutions. Social network analysis combined with epidemiology models helps to identify key transmission characteristics and measure the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies. Finally, future new directions of network analysis motivated by COVID-19 data are summarized.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to all corners of the word, in a very complex manner. A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9-7 days, 4.41-8.4 days, 2.3-10 days and 4.4-7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

   abstract = {Born out of a necessity for fiscal sustainability, simulation modeling is playing an increasingly prominent role in setting priorities for combination implementation strategies for HIV treatment and prevention globally. The design of a model and the data inputted into it are central factors in ensuring credible inferences. We executed a narrative review of a set of dynamic HIV transmission models to comprehensively synthesize and compare the structural design and the quality of evidence used to support each model. We included 19 models representing both generalized and concentrated epidemics, classified as compartmental, agent-based, individual-based microsimulation or hybrid in our review. We focused on four structural components (population construction; model entry, exit and HIV care engagement; HIV disease progression; and the force of HIV infection), and two analytical components (model calibration/validation; and health economic evaluation, including uncertainty analysis). While the models we reviewed focused on a variety of individual interventions and their combinations, their structural designs were relatively homogenous across three of the four focal components, with key structural elements influenced by model type and epidemiological context. In contrast, model entry, exit and HIV care engagement tended to differ most across models, with some health system interactions-particularly HIV testing-not modeled explicitly in many contexts. The quality of data used in the models and the transparency with which the data was presented differed substantially across model components. Representative and high-quality data on health service delivery were most commonly not accessed or were unavailable. The structure of an HIV model should ideally fit its epidemiological context and be able to capture all efficacious treatment and prevention services relevant to a robust combination implementation strategy. Developing standardized guidelines on evidence syntheses for health economic evaluation would improve transparency and help prioritize data collection to reduce decision uncertainty.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {Public health surveillance serves a crucial function within health systems, enabling the monitoring, early detection, and warning of infectious diseases. Recently, outbreak detection algorithms have gained significant importance across various surveillance systems, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. These algorithms are approached from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The theoretical aspect entails the development and introduction of novel statistical methods that capture the interest of statisticians. In contrast, the practical aspect involves designing outbreak detection systems and employing diverse methodologies for monitoring syndromes, thus drawing the attention of epidemiologists and health managers. Over the past three decades, considerable efforts have been made in the field of surveillance, resulting in valuable publications that introduce new statistical methods and compare their performance. The generalized linear model (GLM) family has undergone various advancements in comparison to other statistical methods and models. This study aims to present and describe GLM-based methods, providing a coherent comparison between them. Initially, a historical overview of outbreak detection algorithms based on the GLM family is provided, highlighting commonly used methods. Furthermore, real data from Measles and COVID-19 are utilized to demonstrate examples of these methods. This study will be useful for researchers in both theoretical and practical aspects of outbreak detection methods, enabling them to familiarize themselves with the key techniques within the GLM family and facilitate comparisons, particularly for those with limited mathematical expertise.Copyright © 2023.

   title = {Using simulation modelling and systems science to help contain COVID-19: A systematic review},
   journal = {Systems research and behavioral science},
   abstract = {This study systematically reviews applications of three simulation approaches, that is, system dynamics model (SDM), agent-based model (ABM) and discrete event simulation (DES), and their hybrids in COVID-19 research and identifies theoretical and application innovations in public health. Among the 372 eligible papers, 72 focused on COVID-19 transmission dynamics, 204 evaluated both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, 29 focused on the prediction of the pandemic and 67 investigated the impacts of COVID-19. ABM was used in 275 papers, followed by 54 SDM papers, 32 DES papers and 11 hybrid model papers. Evaluation and design of intervention scenarios are the most widely addressed area accounting for 55% of the four main categories, that is, the transmission of COVID-19, prediction of the pandemic, evaluation and design of intervention scenarios and societal impact assessment. The complexities in impact evaluation and intervention design demand hybrid simulation models that can simultaneously capture micro and macro aspects of the socio-economic systems involved.
